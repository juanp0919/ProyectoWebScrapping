abstract = {In order to investigate the influencing factors and their action mechanism for university teachers' acceptance of generative AI, this paper integrates the TAM and TOE model, focuses on the variables of self-efficacy, technological efficiency, technological complexity, organizational AI readiness, environmental support, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use, constructs a theoretical model of the influencing factors of university teachers' acceptance of generative AI, and based on 439 questionnaire survey data, the independent effect was analyzed by structural equation method, and the synergistic effect was analyzed by fsQCA method. The analysis results show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on university teachers' acceptance of generative AI. Self-efficacy, technical efficiency, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived usefulness. Self-efficacy, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived ease of use, and technical complexity has a significant negative effect. Furthermore, self-efficacy, technical efficiency, technical complexity, organizational AI readiness, and environmental support do not work independently but synergistically through different combinations, and there are three types of configurations of individual initiative type, system incubation type, and bilateral engagement type. The results of this research can help to further enrich the theoretical system of generative AI application in education, and can also provide practice suggestions for teachers, universities, and education management departments to take effective measures to enhance the acceptance of generative AI in higher education.},

The development of international Chinese education also requires the digitalization and intelligence of international Chinese teaching resources. In this regard, this article utilizes the technology of ChatGPT platform to integrate teaching resources, constructs an artificial intelligence teaching resource generation framework consisting of demand analysis, intelligent generation, and quality assessment modules, as well as a quality evolution model of artificial intelligence international Chinese teaching resources. Based on this framework and resource quality evolution model, an experiment on the generation of artificial intelligence teaching resources was carried out, and inspections and evaluations were conducted from the perspectives of natural language processing technology, learners, and teachers. The results show that the teaching resources generated by artificial intelligence pass the inspection of natural language understanding technology and have good quality; learners and teachers are optimistic about the application of teaching resources in teaching and believe that most of these resources have reached a usable state; learners' overall experience in using teaching resources is positive and they believe that these resources can promote learning in many aspects. The application of artificial intelligence in generating teaching resources in this article helps to optimize the construction mode of international Chinese teaching resources and promote the high-quality development of international Chinese education.},

abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

The BOPPPS (Bridge-in, Objective, Pre-assessment, Participatory learning, Post-assessment, Summary) teaching model provides a structured format for lesson planning and instruction, with the purpose of enhancing student learning and engagement. However, there are still some challenges in the use of the BOPPPS model in practice teaching. For instance, it will take a lot time and energy for teachers to prepare personalized learning resources in different forms and of high quality, and the assessment of students' learning outcomes is difficult to be performed in real time. The following paper discusses how to apply GenAI to the six steps of the BOPPPS teaching model, and in turn, assist the teacher with each of these areas.},

abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

It is recommended to use the A-CDIO educational paradigm. To put it simply, this is a student-centered CDIO framework that incorporates GenAI. The example of “particle effects” is used in teaching. The findings show that this innovative pattern works in actual teaching settings. It not only improves student learning outcomes significantly, but also improves the quality and efficiency of the entire education.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of multimodal data such as text, images and videos on social networks, it is particularly important to extract valuable information from these diverse data sources. In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15\%, and the recall rate is improved by 12\%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

Based on the Integration Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT), we analyzed the influence of factors such as performance expectations, effort expectations, social influences, and enabling conditions on primary and secondary school teachers' use of AIGC. Through questionnaire survey and data analysis, it was found that these factors have a significant effect on teachers' use of AIGC and that there are significant differences in teachers' personal characteristics such as teaching experience, gender and IT proficiency in terms of behavioral intention. In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.},

The study adopts the literature analysis method to systematically sort out the status quo and feasibility of generative AI and online education platform in colleges and universities. On this basis, this paper designs two main paths of intelligent generation of teaching resources and optimization of learning process based on generative AI. The former includes course content generation, teaching interaction generation and evaluation feedback generation; the latter covers learning data analysis, intelligent learning progress tracking and dynamic evaluation of learning effects. Through the theoretical analysis of the path design, this study provides a preliminary theoretical framework and practical ideas for the intelligent upgrading of online education platforms in colleges and universities, which can be used as a reference for the subsequent research and practical application in this field.},

This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

There is limited prior research on computing students' use and perceptions of GenAI. In anticipation of future advances and evolutions of GenAI, we capture a snapshot of student attitudes towards and uses of yet emerging GenAI, in a period of time before university policies had reacted to these technologies. We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

abstract = {This research focuses on the application of AIGC in vocational education digital textbooks and how RAG technology can be used to further improve the interactivity and educational effectiveness of digital textbooks. The paper first analyzes the development of AIGC technology and its great potential in the field of education, especially the role of LLM in content generation. It then discusses the concept, risks, and construction strategies of vocational education digital textbooks, emphasizing the importance of digital textbooks in teaching and their differences compared with paper textbooks. The study also designs a knowledge retrieval question-answering system based on RAG, which combines school-based textbooks and cooperative enterprise manuals as a knowledge base to generate responses to student questions. While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge. This framework of the RAG question-answering system can provide accurate answers to satisfy students of all levels in personalized teaching while maintaining explainability and timeliness of the content.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

For open education learners who aim to just obtain adult education diplomas, particularly, the cost of learning assessment is becoming increasingly low due to the use of generative AI. How to instructional design and assessment for open education learners in the era of generative AI becomes therefore an issue requiring urgent solutions.

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

abstract = {Generative AI changes the paradigm of natural language processing research, sets off a new trend of research in computational humanities and computational social sciences, and provides unique perspectives on digital intelligence-enabled ancient book revitalization and intelligent applications. The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.},

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities—such as text-to-speech and text-to-image—are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

Conversational agents developed for HFA children in previous studies show limitations in children's learning effectiveness due to the conversational agents’ inability to dynamically generate personalized and contextual content. Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

abstract = {Recently, generative AI technology has arisen as a trending research agenda in education. This study makes an review of 260 documents from the CNKI database published from 2020 to 2024. Through the bibliometric and content analysis methods, together with the CiteSpace tool, highlight the trending application of this technology in education, the distribution characteristics of the core authors and institutions' postings, and the clustering analysis of the research hotspots. The results show continued wide adoption of generative AI technology in education in recent years, peaking sharply in 2023. There hasn't been a stable core group of authors within the field, and the collaborative network is relatively sparse. Research hotspots mainly cover artificial intelligence, human-computer collaboration and educational transformation, which indicates the function generative AI technology could have within the digital transformation and quality enhancement of education. This paper additionally shows the actualization of generative AI technology through its presentation of AI tutors and teaching assistants, teaching models reform, and reshaped instructional evaluation systems via case studies. In face of misuse, integrity issues, and ethical concerns arising, there is a need to find a balance in the application of the technology, such that its more proper development can promote rather than replace human subjectivity.},

abstract = {With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence in General Chat (AIGC), represented by ChatGPT, collaborative learning tasks between university students and machines have become a new norm in higher education. Simply prohibiting this new wave of technology cannot fundamentally address its challenges. This article presents the results of a survey investigating Chinese university students' perspectives on generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, in supporting their learning. It analyzes the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology. Universities need to adapt to this transformation by altering the nature of student assignments and the methods of assessment. Additionally, they must effectively leverage the advantages of students conveniently acquiring knowledge through AIGC and the opportunity for personalized tutoring across various subjects. Striking the right balance between opportunities and challenges is crucial for creating a more productive and beneficial learning environment. Ultimately, this adaptation will better prepare education for the developments and changes in the era of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

abstract = {This research explores the application of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence technology, in the field of education. ChatGPT, short for "generative pre-training," continuously evolves and adapts through user feedback, facilitating authentic human-machine interaction. It can process natural language input and generate relevant responses, thereby providing information and answering questions. The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT in university teacher education, where it can offer intelligent teaching assistance, personalized learning resources, and instructional support. However, the integration of ChatGPT also raises challenges, such as redefining the authority of knowledge and altering the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship. Some scholars contend that ChatGPT cannot replicate genuine emotions or free will, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of education. The transformative impact of ChatGPT on education demands a reevaluation of teachers' roles and professional development in the digital age. This study seeks to clarify the role of teachers within the digital transformation represented by ChatGPT and to explore strategies for successfully navigating this shift. Additionally, the research aims to assess teachers' perceptions and utilization of ChatGPT, address related challenges, and evaluate the feasibility, potential applications, and limitations of its integration into teaching.},

Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

abstract = {This paper presents StyleSpeech, a novel Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that enhances the naturalness and accuracy of synthesized speech. StyleSpeech incorporates a Style Decorator structure that enables deep learning models to learn style and phoneme features simultaneously. It improves adaptability and efficiency through the principles of Lower Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA allows efficient adaptation of style features in pre-trained models. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic evaluation metric, the LLM-Guided Mean Opinion Score (LLM-MOS), which employs large language models to offer an objective and robust protocol for automatically assessing TTS system performance. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets shows our approach markedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods in producing natural, accurate, and high-quality speech. These advancements not only push the boundaries of current TTS system capabilities, but also facilitate the application of TTS system in more dynamic and specialized, such as interactive virtual assistants, adaptive audiobooks, and customized voice for gaming.

abstract = {This research proposes leveraging commute time by car for idea incubation, targeting 80\% of the US workforce who commute daily. Commuting, a potentially "mindless" task for seasoned drivers, offers an ideal environment for creative thinking that can be enhanced by mild immersive interactions to improve idea generation. The project integrates psychological interventions tailored for driving, drawing on automated driving advancements to ensure safety and effectiveness. Using a context-aware sensing framework, interactions are timed during appropriate driving scenarios to minimize distraction. The system obtains context data from car sensors and employs generative AI to deliver subtle interactions, enhancing user engagement and idea output without compromising safety. Evaluation includes measuring user engagement and post-drive self-reports to quantify the impact on idea generation and driving performance. This innovation integrates creativity support tools into daily commutes, potentially transforming in-car intelligence systems and enhancing productivity and innovation capabilities.},

abstract = {Generative AI seems poised to transform a wide range of endeavors once thought to be solely the domain of humans—from journalism to legal practice to creative expression—into collaborative activities involving both human and machine. Poetry is no exception, as even general-purpose language models now routinely generate convincing emulations of poetic form. While researchers have closely examined such machine-generated poetry, few have studied human-AI collaboration in poetry writing from a posthuman perspective. Through semi-structured interviews with ten participants in an AI English poetry contest and an analysis of their dialogs with AIs, we summarize the affordances and challenges of such collaborative practice using posthumanism as a lens. We then expose interesting tensions, for example, between human self-expression and the diminished (or relocated) agency that AI collaboration often entails. This collaborative, yet often adversarial, process provides insights into the nature of the posthuman condition as regards creative collaboration between human and machine.},

The technical implementation includes generative AI tools for text, audio and animation production. Issues such as ensuring the accuracy of information, maintaining user privacy and preventing biases in AI-generated content are identified. The importance of co-creation with experts and adherence to ethical standards are highlighted to create a reliable educational tool.

A major issue in this field is how the generation can be easily controlled. In this talk we will focus on some of our recent works in generative models that are primarily aimed at controllable generation. We will first present unsupervised methods for learning non-linear paths in the latent spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks such that following different paths lead to different types of changes (e.g., removing the background, changing head poses, or facial expressions) in the resulting images&nbsp;[4]. Subsequently, we will present a method that allows local editing by finding a Parts and Appearances decomposition in the GAN latent space&nbsp;[2]. Then, we will present recent works on reenactment&nbsp;[1], where the goal is to transfer the facial activity (pose, expressions, speech) of a certain person to another one, and recent works in which supervision for generation comes from language models&nbsp;[3]. Finally, we will touch on the technical challenges ahead, as well on the challenges that this creates in spreading misinformation.},

However, sentiment information of financial texts requires a lot of domain expert knowledge, and manual retrieval is expensive. In this paper, we propose the application of an evolutionary generative model for sentiment retrieval of financial information based on interactive genetic algorithms from the perspective of user implicit modeling. The uncertain preference estimation of evolutionary individuals is realized. The user preference model is adjusted according to the uncertainty evaluation, and the user preference is dynamically tracked to obtain the fitness value of the evolutionary individual for evolutionary optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed method can implicitly perceive user preferences, reduce user explicit evaluation, reduce user fatigue, and improve the search performance of the algorithm.},

This paper explores the idea of a Ditto—an agent that visually resembles a person, sounds like them, possesses knowledge about them, and can represent them in meetings. This paper reports on results from two empirical investigations: 1) focus group sessions with six groups (n=24) and 2) a Wizard of Oz (WOz) study with 10 groups (n=39) recruited from within a large technology company. Results from the focus group sessions provide insights on what contexts are appropriate for Dittos, and issues around social acceptability and representation risk. The focus group results also provide feedback on visual design characteristics for Dittos. In the WOz study, teams participated in meetings with two different embodied agents: a Ditto and a Delegate (an agent which did not resemble the absent person). Insights from this research demonstrate the impact these embodied agents can have in meetings and highlight that Dittos in particular show promise in evoking feelings of presence and trust, as well as informing decision making. These results also highlight issues related to relationship dynamics such as maintaining social etiquette, managing one's professional reputation, and upholding accountability. Overall, our investigation provides early evidence that Dittos could be beneficial to represent users when they are unable to be present but also outlines many factors that need to be carefully considered to successfully realize this vision.},

abstract = {Generative AI (AI) has become ubiquitous in both daily and professional life, with emerging research demonstrating its potential as a tool for accessibility. Neurodivergent people, often left out by existing accessibility technologies, develop their own ways of navigating normative expectations. GAI offers new opportunities for access, but it is important to understand how neurodivergent “power users”—successful early adopters—engage with it and the challenges they face. Further, we must understand how marginalization and intersectional identities influence their interactions with GAI. Our autoethnography, enhanced by privacy-preserving GAI-based diaries and interviews, reveals the intricacies of using GAI to navigate normative environments and expectations. Our findings demonstrate how GAI can both support and complicate tasks like code-switching, emotional regulation, and accessing information. We show that GAI can help neurodivergent users to reclaim their agency in systems that diminish their autonomy and self-determination. However, challenges such as balancing authentic self-expression with societal conformity, alongside other risks, create barriers to realizing GAI’s full potential for accessibility.},

abstract = {This qualitative paper examines the needs of residents to remember a local cultural heritage site collaboratively. The study observes and then designs for intangible affordances supporting this memory recall using the photo-elicitation method with generative artificial intelligence imagery. Specifically, collaboration was observed when editing a panoramic photograph using generative artificial intelligence. These instances were rare, and were analyzed to highlight intangible affordances aiding collaborative memory recall and content creation. Afterward, five examples were correlated to influence the design of an immersive and responsive 360° theatre system using specific combinations of artificial intelligence models to aid subjective recall. In this immersive space, storyteller preferences for edited content are finally made available for new users, thereby affording new collaborative storytelling about a cultural heritage site. As a contribution, this study aids the work of designers and sociologists by showing the photo-elicitation method’s crossdisciplinary relevance to designing for collaborative, yet intangible storytelling affordances.},

abstract = {Most of the attention on GenAI in computing education has focused on programming-centric tasks, such as code generation, giving feedback on code, or providing synthetic programming partners. Yet in advanced software engineering and project courses, interpersonal skills such as team meetings or customer interviews are equally important but difficult and instructor-intensive to teach realistically. GenAI presents the possibility of scaffolding the teaching of some of these practices by enabling exercises in which students develop the ability to investigate a topic by iteratively asking questions to find a solution. The goal is to create scenarios in which students train to interact with humans in real-world situations, simulating these interactions in a controlled, guided environment. These simulations could help students practice and refine ''soft skills,'' such as teamwork and interviewing, by mimicking the types of exchanges and problem-solving they would encounter in professional environments. This approach allows learners to engage in realistic communication exercises, improving their ability to handle complex, interpersonal tasks through repeated practice with AI-guided feedback. As an example, we envision examples that include requirements elicitation with customers, development team meetings, and discussion with potential investors, to name just a few.},

The use of asynchronous oral exams is motivated by the need for alternative assessment methods to manage large CS enrollments, the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the growing importance of building asynchronous technical communication skills. The asynchronous oral exam intervention involves the student recording a short video discussing the key components of an open-ended final project, specifically addressing how five required coding concepts/constructs are utilized and implemented to achieve a meaningful summary and visualization of a chosen data set. The asynchronous oral exams provide students with vital practice in verbalizing coding concepts, similar to the asynchronous components of technical job interviews, while redistributing instructor and TA resources with more time flexibility to provide valuable feedback to students.},

We propose an innovative semantic information-theoretic framework, introducing semantic entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, and rate-distortion concepts specifically adapted to multimedia applications. This framework redefines multimedia communication from purely syntactic data transmission to semantic information conveyance. We further highlight future opportunities and critical research directions. We chart a path toward robust, efficient, and semantically meaningful multimedia communication systems by bridging generative AI innovations with information theory.

Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case). Experiments on ML1M and LFM1M show that KGGLM beats twenty-two baselines in effectiveness under both knowledge completion and recommendation.

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence chatbots are powerful tools that support users with disabilities across diverse contexts, including work, communication, and everyday life. Specifically within the neurodivergent population, numerous studies have illustrated increased use of LLM chatbots in applications for mental health, well-being, education, and professional support, along with their further potential to serve this community. Our work builds on this scholarship by investigating how neurodivergent individuals use Large Language Model-based chatbots in real-life settings. We conducted interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants to understand their expansive use of these chatbots, which we present as use case categories. We then designed diary studies to capture prompting strategies participants employ within these use cases while conversing with the Large Language Model-based chatbot Gemini. Based on early analysis of our conversational dataset, we showcase specific prompting queries from participants, highlight participant strategies to refine Gemini’s responses, and identify Gemini’s strengths and weaknesses during interaction.},

abstract = {The software engineering landscape is experiencing a significant transformation with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices. This doctoral research proposal aims to explore potential solutions for these issues.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50\% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43\% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning. We use these duality findings to extend previous recommendations for integrating generative AI in education by providing new recommendations on how educators can support help-seeking and peer support in the age of GenAI.},

Although generative AI has become a part of everyday life, many people still lack a clear understanding of how it works. Without a solid understanding of generative AI, it can be difficult for individuals to fully embrace this emerging technology. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the concepts, technologies, and real-world impact of generative AI.The course begins with a historical overview of artificial intelligence that traces its evolution from early rules-based logic to the deep learning breakthroughs that have enabled today's most powerful generative AI models. Participants will explore foundational concepts that include illustrations of neural network models to gain intuition behind how machines learn to generate text, images, and other types of content. The course delves into practical applications of generative AI across multiple modalities, including natural language, computer vision, audio, and more. Participants will also study high-level system architectures of an AI chatbot, the poster child of generative AI, to understand how these systems operate. Finally, the course will examine future development of generative AI, including the rise of agentic applications that can reason, plan, and interact autonomously.},

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

A conversational AI platform, powered by ChatGPT, was developed as a pilot, and used as a virtual tutor, guiding students through an interactive, time-constrained learning session that involved two steps: teaching the new topic followed by problem-solving activities. After the session, students wrote a quiz without assistance to evaluate their newly acquired knowledge. A survey was then administered to collect student perceptions and analyze their interactions with the AI tutor. The preliminary findings suggest that GenAI tutors can effectively support learning, with most students preferring AI over human tutors due to convenience, accessibility, and stress-free environment. While variability of prompt effectiveness and students' misuse or overreliance on AI highlight areas were observed, these results highlight avenues for future research to refine GenAI strategies and improve student learning.},

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and “hard” criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.},

abstract = {In this study, we explore the potential of AI-generated podcasts as an educational tool in the evolving landscape of learning media. Podcasts have grown increasingly relevant in education due to their accessibility and ability to integrate learning into everyday life. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is a unique opportunity for scalable and adaptable creation of learning media. However, with novel technology, there also come new challenges. Thus, we developed fine-tuned AI-generated podcasts using Google NotebookLM, our course materials, and a custom prompt. We conducted a one-month explorative evaluation in the field using a qualitative diary study. Our study reveals that students find the podcasts beneficial for flexible everyday learning but also point toward challenges like a lack of emotional engagement and technical non-English language issues. In sum, our study highlights the current benefits and challenges of AI-generated podcasts and presents an agenda for future research.},

abstract = {Speculative approaches to technology-enabled futures of ageing often struggle against reductive and immaterial imaginaries that diverge from everyday realities. This is compounded by the mainstream embrace of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that reinforce many of the stigmas and biases we have long sought to reduce in technology studies. In seeking innovative ways to critique AI-generated futures and realize novel ways of speculating on the desirable, everyday futures older adults seek, we detail emergent findings from a series of workshops employing a generative postcard approach with a local community group in Scotland. Drawing on a previous analysis of opportunities to support care in later life through an ecological carescape framework, workshops captured precarious visions, generational perspectives, and potential ways of reconfiguring care futures. We highlight how the techno-deterministic visions of generative AI are both a feature and tool for critique as we link ageing futures with everyday realities of the present.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the creation of 3D human faces (HFs) for applications including media production, virtual reality, security, healthcare, and game development, etc. However, assessing the quality and realism of these AI-generated 3D human faces remains a significant challenge due to the subjective nature of human perception and innate perceptual sensitivity to facial features. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on the quality assessment of AI-generated 3D human faces. We first introduce Gen3DHF, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,000 videos of AI-Generated 3D Human Faces along with 4,000 Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) collected across two dimensions, i.e., quality and authenticity, 2,000 distortion-aware saliency maps and distortion descriptions. Based on Gen3DHF, we propose LMME3DHF, a Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based metric for Evaluating 3DHF capable of quality and authenticity score prediction, distortion-aware visual question answering, and distortion-aware saliency prediction. Experimental results show that LMME3DHF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both accurately predicting quality scores for AI-generated 3D human faces and effectively identifying distortion-aware salient regions and distortion types, while maintaining strong alignment with human perceptual judgments. Both the Gen3DHF database and the LMME3DHF will be released upon the publication.},

abstract = {Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks. This is a step towards bringing generative artificial intelligence into the messy complexity of physically embodied creative practice.},

abstract = {This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and - among other approaches - particularly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, code, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities in ethical ways. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.Following successful workshops in 2022–2024, we convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

Unlike visual errors in genAI, textual mistakes are often harder to detect and require specific domain knowledge. Furthermore, AI’s authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer \&amp; Moreno’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.},

Existing solutions for trace reconstruction often fail to fully leverage available data, particularly in complex and high-dimensional contexts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly diffusion models, have set new benchmarks in image, audio, and natural language generation. This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSDS4 model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.},

Within the context of co-housing communities, we conducted a participatory design study with participants in co-creating their future communities.

However, the limited availability of such datasets remains a key barrier to the development of next-generation video processing solutions. In this paper, we introduce Nature-1k, a large-scale video dataset consisting of 1000 professionally captured 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) videos, each recorded at 60fps. The dataset covers a wide range of environments, lighting conditions, texture complexities, and motion patterns. To maintain temporal consistency, which is crucial for spatio-temporal learning applications, the dataset avoids scene cuts within the sequences. We further characterize the dataset using established metrics, including spatial and temporal video complexity metrics, as well as colorfulness, brightness, and contrast distribution. Moreover, Nature-1k includes a compressed version to support rapid prototyping and lightweight testing. The quality of the compressed videos is evaluated using four commonly used video quality metrics: PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, and VMAF. Finally, we compare Nature-1k with existing datasets to demonstrate its superior quality and content diversity. The dataset is suitable for a wide range of applications, including Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), video super-resolution and enhancement, video interpolation, as well as video coding, and adaptive video streaming optimization.

abstract = {Classifying malware images is important in cybersecurity. The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is finding increased adoption in workplaces, current tools are primarily designed for individual use. Prior work established the potential for these tools to enhance personal creativity and productivity towards shared goals; however, we don't know yet how to best take into account the nuances of group work and team dynamics when deploying GenAI in work settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential of collaborative GenAI agents to augment teamwork in synchronous group settings through an exploratory study that engaged 25 professionals across 6 teams in speculative design workshops and individual follow-up interviews. Our workshops included a mixed reality provotype to simulate embodied collaborative GenAI agents capable of actively participating in group discussions. Our findings suggest that, if designed well, collaborative GenAI agents offer valuable opportunities to enhance team problem-solving by challenging groupthink, bridging communication gaps, and reducing social friction. However, teams' willingness to integrate GenAI agents depended on its perceived fit across a number of individual, team, and organizational factors. We outline the key design tensions around agent representation, social prominence, and engagement and highlight the opportunities spatial and immersive technologies could offer to modulate GenAI influence on team outcomes and strike a balance between augmentation and agency.},

Although generative AI agents provide unparalleled capabilities, they also have unique safety concerns. These challenges require robust safeguards, especially for autonomous machines that operate in high-stakes environments. This work investigates the evolving safety requirements when generative models are integrated as agents into physical autonomous machines, comparing these to safety considerations in less critical AI applications. We explore the challenges and opportunities to ensure the safe deployment of generative AI-driven autonomous machines. Furthermore, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI-driven autonomous systems and emphasize the importance of evaluating and communicating safety risks. As an important step towards addressing these concerns, we recommend the development and implementation of comprehensive safety scorecards for the use of generative AI technologies in autonomous machines.},

But exams do not afford more authentic programming experiences that involve planning, implementing, and debugging programs with computer interaction. In this experience report, we describe code interviews: a more authentic assessment method for take-home programming assignments. Through action research, we experimented with the number and type of questions as well as whether interviews were conducted individually or with groups of students. To scale the program, we converted most of our weekly teaching assistant (TA) sections to conduct code interviews on 5 major weekly take-home programming assignments. By triangulating data from 5 sources, we identified 4 themes. Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback. We reflect on the design of code interviews for student experience, academic integrity, and teacher workload.},

At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

abstract = {The release of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have prompted universities to introduce new policies or update existing ones. Currently, most institutions adapt their policies reactively as challenges arise, often without adopting a systematic framework, with minimal guidance and limited knowledge of the approaches taken by other institutions across the United States (U.S.). This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities. Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes. Our framework first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level, followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement. Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated. This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations. Seven distinct themes are uncovered: (1) academic integrity and responsible AI use, (2) communication of AI policies, (3) data privacy and security concerns, (4) ethical considerations in AI use, (5) continuous adaptation and policy evolution, (6) documentation and transparency in AI usage, and (7) instructor discretion in AI integration. Our work lays the foundation for future analyses or recommendations in developing comprehensive and equitable AI policies. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs allows us to respond swiftly to developments surrounding AI policies across universities.},

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then performed system-level testing to evaluate the ability of the ADS to generalize to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help to increase the coverage of ODD for system-level ADS testing. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3\%, retaining the correctness and quality of the images generated for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.},

However, consumers often struggle to articulate their preferred product features due to their unfamiliarity with terminology and their limited understanding of the structure of product features. We present DesignFromX, a system that empowers consumer-driven design space exploration by helping consumers to design a product based on their preferences. Leveraging an effective GenAI-based framework, the system allows users to easily identify design features from product images and compose those features to generate conceptual images and 3D models of a new product. A user study with 24 participants demonstrates that DesignFromX lowers the barriers and frustration for consumer-driven design space explorations by enhancing both engagement and enjoyment for the participants.},

abstract = {Academic writing is one of the most important tasks in Academia. The pressure to "publish or perish" drives researchers to use all the tools available to try to improve their papers and their impact. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can create content such as text, tables, and images can be used for many tasks in academic writing such as summarizing, translating, paraphrasing, data analysis, and presentation. Therefore, AI is expected to be widely used in academic writing in the near future and have a significant impact. Understanding this impact is far from trivial and needs to be carefully studied. The first step in doing so is to be able to identify papers written with the help of AI tools. This can be done by adding metadata on the use of AI in academic results. In this paper, we embark on an initial endeavor to devise such metadata and delineate the potential advantages that the inclusion of AI-related metadata in academic publications may bring forth.},

With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

abstract = {Due to the significant generative capabilities of GenAI (generative artificial intelligence), the art community has actively embraced it to create painterly content. Large text-to-image models can quickly generate aesthetically pleasing outcomes. However, the process can be non-deterministic and often involves tedious trial-and-error as users struggle to formulate effective prompts to achieve their desired results. This paper describes a generative approach that empowers users to easily work with a large text-to-image (TTI) model to create their preferred painterly content. The authors propose a large model personalization method, namely Semantic Injection, to personalize a large TTI model in a given specific artistic style, i.e., Kandinsky’s paintings in Bauhaus era, as the Artist Model. Through working with a Kandinsky expert, the authors first establish a semantic descriptive guideline and a TTI dataset of Kandinsky style and then apply the Semantic Injection method to obtain an Artist Model of Kandinsky, empowering users to create preferred Kandinsky content in a deterministically controllable manner.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence extends beyond its success in image/text synthesis, proving itself a powerful uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique through its capability to sample from complex high-dimensional probability distributions. However, existing methods often require a complicated training process, which greatly hinders their applications to real-world UQ problems, especially in dynamic UQ tasks where the target probability distribution evolves rapidly with time. To alleviate this challenge, we have developed a scalable, training-free score-based diffusion model for high-dimensional sampling. We incorporate a parallel-in-time method into our diffusion model to use a large number of GPUs to solve the backward stochastic differential equation and generate new samples of the target distribution. Moreover, we also distribute the computation of the large matrix subtraction used by the training-free score estimator onto multiple GPUs available across all nodes. Compared to existing methods, our approach completely avoids training the score function, making it capable of adapting to rapid changes in the target probability distribution. We showcase the remarkable strong and weak scaling capabilities of the proposed method on the Frontier supercomputer, as well as its uncertainty reduction capability in hurricane predictions when coupled with AI-based foundation models.},

abstract = {Our research investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, specifically text-to-image generators (T2Is), on the representation of non-Western cultures, with a focus on Indian contexts. Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a Non-Western community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English input prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, contributing to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise as these models are deployed on a global scale.},

ParaGAN employs a congestion-aware data pipeline and hardware-aware layout transformation to enhance accelerator utilization, resulting in over 30\% improvements in throughput. With ParaGAN, we reduce the training time of BigGAN from 15 days to 14 hours while achieving 91\% scaling efficiency. Additionally, ParaGAN enables unprecedented high-resolution image generation using BigGAN.},

This paper proposes the Emotion-Art Prompt Framework (EAPF) which provides a systematic link between Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions and L\"{o}vheim's three-dimensional model with basic underlying elements of art — form, color, light/shadow, and composition to facilitate drawing generation in an AI setting. This paper describes a new system architecture that autonomously maps layered emotional descriptors onto structured prompts interfacing with the Tencent Yuanbao AI drawing platform. Through a large-scale experiment involving more than 800 students (aged 10–12) in Shenzhen (China), we assessed quantitative and qualitative data embedded in emotional alignment, creative engagement, and platform suitability. Our findings show that EAPF substantially improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated works of art, while offering data-based insights for educators to tailor art teaching to individual student preferences. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of well-designed prompt engineering to overcome accessibility barriers in traditional art education while enhancing emotional development. Additionally, it proposes a scalable model for integrating AI technologies into K–12 creative learning.},

However, generating automated End-to-End (E2E) tests can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for junior developers. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT, a popular Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) model, as an assistant in developing automated E2E test scripts for Android apps. We present an empirical study that compares the effort required to create E2E test scripts and the resulting reliability of these tests using two treatments: manually and assisted by ChatGPT. We used Gherkin, a domain-specific language that allows non-technical practitioners to define test scenarios using a human-readable syntax. Our findings indicate that using ChatGPT significantly reduces the time required to develop automated test scripts without compromising the reliability of the scripts. Statistical analysis shows a notable reduction in development time for the ChatGPT-assisted group compared to the manual group, with a large effect size. While the reliability of the tests did not show a significant difference between the two groups, the results suggest practical benefits in terms of efficiency.},

There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female) recruited and divided between the four performances. After the survey, we conducted focus groups with a subset of audience members.

However, there is still a lack of in-depth exploration of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education, especially in areas such as personalized learning and precision teaching, the integration of virtual and actual teaching spaces, intelligent teaching facilities and resources, human-computer collaborative teaching methods, and interdisciplinary innovative research methods.We should actively respond to the opportunities and challenges brought by intelligent tools such as ChatGPT to higher education, and comprehensively and deeply explore how to integrate ChatGPT into key areas of digital education, including teaching design, teaching resource development, teaching organization and implementation, teaching evaluation and reflection, learning and personal knowledge management, innovation team building, and enhancing the digital literacy and professional capabilities of teachers and students. In addition, the impact of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education on educational equity, and how to ensure that all students can benefit from it through reasonable design and use, should also be of concern.

These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines across multiple data modalities, including images, video, audio, and 3D assets. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.},

To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

Users can now express not only their queries and questions, but actual information needs, tasks, and goals in natural language to an AI system and receive not just results, but also answers in natural language that are generated specifically for them. This new paradigm raises many interesting questions, opportunities, and challenges.

Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, tools that once could only be used by highly qualified technical personnel are now in the hands of potentially inexperienced users, but unfortunately, the understanding of the layman is very far from the machinery behind the scenes. More than ever, it is necessary to help people develop an awareness that allows them to use these tools in an appropriate way and with the appropriate expectations. We believe this problem should be addressed by exploring ways to train thinking strategies to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts that can be applied in daily life, not just by developing teaching tools on this or that topic.

We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

abstract = {This paper joins the growing body of HCI work on critical AI studies and focuses on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in Bangladesh. While the West has started to examine the limitations and risks associated with these tools, their impacts on the Global South have remained understudied. Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.},

abstract = {Propelled by their remarkable capabilities to generate novel and engaging content, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies are disrupting traditional workflows in many industries. While prior research has examined GenAI from a techno-centric perspective, there is still a lack of understanding about how users perceive and utilize GenAI in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with (N = 18) GenAI users in creative industries, investigating the human-GenAI co-creation process within a holistic LUA (Learning, Using and Assessing) framework. Our study uncovered an intriguingly complex landscape: Prospects – GenAI greatly fosters the co-creation between human expertise and GenAI capabilities, profoundly transforming creative workflows; Challenges – Meanwhile, users face substantial uncertainties and complexities arising from resource availability, tool usability, and regulatory compliance; Strategies – In response, users actively devise various strategies to overcome many of such challenges. Our study reveals key implications for the design of future GenAI tools.},

However, few subjects in special schools cover AI-related topics, and it remains unclear how students with special educational needs (SEN) perceive, learn, and use AI. In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

MidJourney collaborates with large-scale language models to transform cultural relics features into structured prompt, and combines cross-modal narration to ensure historical logic consistency. Through social media A/B testing, the communication efficiency of the generated IP is significantly higher than that of traditional manual design, and the reference rate of cultural keywords is significantly improved, which promotes the innovative communication of cultural heritage among young groups, and provides a theoretical paradigm and practical reference in the interdisciplinary application field of AIGC.},

abstract = {Video streaming stands as the cornerstone of telecommunication networks, constituting over 60\% of mobile data traffic as of June 2023. The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

AI Archive is based on diffusion models and was trained on the entire archive of adidas sneakers, which dates back to the company’s beginning in the 1950ies. Being trained on this unique dataset enables the AI to generate new and innovative sneaker designs that draw inspiration from the archive and pay homage to the rich history of the adidas brand. AI Archive has been rolled out to our designers as a web application in 2022. The tool has since established itself as an essential ingredient in the concept-to-prototype process of many of our designers. The proposed system gives users a high level of control over the design process, enabling them to precisely guide the AI to create designs according to their direction. We believe that the use of generative AI in footwear design has the potential to transform the industry, as it allows designers to explore hundreds of different concepts in almost no time.},

abstract = {This poster reports on the differences in perceptions concerning academic dishonesty and the misuse of resources in college from the perspectives of students, teaching assistants (TAs), and instructors in Computer Science (CS). Dishonesty has been a topic of interest in the CS education community, with efforts addressing how to detect and prevent it [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]. With the presence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in recent years, studying all actors’ perspectives on dishonesty in regard to generative AI becomes critical to promote guidelines and strategies for curricular design in CS [4, 5], aligning those who teach and those who learn towards a common ethical ground. This led us to explore the following research questions with a specific emphasis on artificial intelligence in mind:(1)RQ1: How do students, instructors, and teaching assistants respond to scenarios suggesting academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?(2)RQ2: What reasons do students, instructors, and teaching assistants in CS consider may lead someone toward academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?We surveyed 538 undergraduate students, 21 TAs, and six Computer Science (CS) instructors at a large Southeastern U.S. institution. Students and TAs were part of two undergraduate CS courses. Responses were gathered via an online questionnaire that featured 13 multiple-choice questions on whether the participant thought particular situations fell most closely within “serious cheating,” “trivial cheating,” or “no cheating”–questions adapted from the work by Ozment et al. [3]; one open-ended question on the reasons the participant considered why someone might cheat in the CS classroom; and demographic questions. This poster focuses specifically on participants’ responses to the open-ended question, via a thematic analysis to identify recurring categories (i.e., themes) and assess the affinity of participants’ responses within each theme. Subgroups were participants’ demographics and backgrounds.Our findings suggest that all participants have diverse perspectives. Instructors generally referred to "Grade Pressure" and "Laziness" as the top two reasons behind dishonesty, while TAs and students emphasized "Prerequisite Knowledge" and "Time Management" as the main contributing factors. These findings suggest a dichotomy among actors involved in the learning processes happening in the CS classroom.Our work underscores the need for awareness and support strategies in curricular initiatives within the CS Ed community to help prevent dishonesty and promote student success in their computing disciplines. A clear disconnect between instructor expectations and student perceptions encourages clearer communication in the classroom and is a ripe avenue for further study.},

However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems. We detail 10 interviews with IT professionals, the resulting recommender system developed, and 20 user sessions with IT professionals interacting with our prompt recommendations. Results indicate that responsible prompting recommendations have the potential to support novice prompt engineers and raise awareness about RAI in prompting-time. They also suggest that recommendations should simultaneously maximize both a prompt’s similarity to a user’s input as well as a diversity of associated social values provided. These findings contribute to RAI by offering practical ways to provide user guidance and enrich human-GenAI interaction via prompt recommendations.},

This  research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality. The results show that a formalization using GenAI has a high potential, but currently also shows deficits in the correctness of the resulting models, requiring human oversight during the model creation.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is widely used for various tasks such as language translation and art creation. Generative inference employs the key and value tensors to encode relational information among the tokens in the input and output sequences. Most of the existing generative inference frameworks use KV caching (KVC), which caches the key and value tensors (i.e., the KV cache) to avoid recomputing the key and value tensors for each of the processed tokens. Despite the widespread use of KVC, in-depth characterization of KVC with tensor offloading, which enables generative inference with a single GPU, remains yet to be explored. To bridge this gap, this work presents an in-depth characterization study of KVC, which demonstrates that KVC makes a sub-optimal trade-off between computations and communications in the context of generative inference with tensor offloading. Guided by the characterization results, we propose a novel caching technique called activation sequence caching (ASC) for high-throughput and memory-efficient generative inference with a single GPU. ASC is designed to significantly reduce the memory usage and communication overheads of generative inference at the cost of the increased computational complexity. We provide an analytical analysis of the three caching techniques (i.e., zero caching, KVC, and ASC) for generative inference in terms of the memory usage, communication overheads, and computational complexity. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ASC in that ASC significantly (e.g., 78.3\% higher throughput) outperforms a state-of-the-art generative inference framework (i.e., FlexGen) that implements KVC across various model sizes, input and output sequence lengths, and GPUs.},

abstract = {This research explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into immersive, site-specific theater through a collaborative initiative between Moment Factory and Third Rail Projects. The objective was to investigate how GenAI technologies can augment dramaturgical practices by enabling co-creation among authors, performers, and audience members.Using an iterative research-creation methodology, the project unfolded in two phases: a remote prototyping cycle and an on-site laboratory. Across three use cases: generative scenography, physical space extension, and improvised narration—AI tools were integrated into live performance contexts to dynamically respond to human presence and input. Techniques included the use of real-time generative visuals, silhouette-based transformations, and voice-activated storytelling systems.The findings highlight both the creative opportunities and technical constraints of employing GenAI in live performance. Critical insights emerged around timing, audience perception, system orchestration, and the need for adaptable, artist-centric AI workflows. This study emphasizes the potential of GenAI to function not merely as a technical instrument, but as a dramaturgical collaborator in the creation of emotionally resonant, participatory experiences.},

abstract = {Creating expressive and realistic motion animations is a challenging task. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have emerged to address this challenge, offering the capability to synthesize human motion animations from text prompts. However, the effective integration of AI-generated motion into professional designer workflows remains uncertain. This study proposes MoWa, an authoring tool designed to refine AI-generated human motions to meet professional standards. A formative study with six professional motion designers identified the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated motions. To address these weaknesses, MoWa utilizes latent space to enhance the expressiveness of motions, making them suitable for use in professional workflows. A user study involving twelve professional motion designers was conducted to evaluate MoWa’s effectiveness in refining AI-generated motions. The results indicated that MoWa streamlines the motion design process and improves the quality of the outcomes. These findings suggest that incorporating latent space into motion design tasks can improve efficiency.},

abstract = {With the recent advancement in technology, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can produce hyper-realistic multimedia content, such as audio, text, images, and videos. Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

Fortunately, digitization of museum artifacts makes it possible to use museum resources within the classroom. Museum in the Classroom (MITC) explores how augmented reality (AR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create an interactive learning experience around museum artifacts. This iPad app allows educators to select historical topics from a curated artifact library, generating AR-based exhibits that students can explore. MITC engages students through interactive AR artifacts, AI-driven chatbots, and AI-generated quiz questions, based on a real exhibition at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. A formative study with middle schoolers (N = 20) demonstrated that the app increased engagement compared to traditional learning methods. MITC also fostered a playful and comfortable environment to interact with museum artifacts. Our findings suggest that combining AR and AI has the potential to enrich classroom learning and offer a scalable alternative to traditional museum visits.},

However, little consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency, the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important takeaways for future work.},

In this study, we explore the accessibility and usability of the interfaces of four popular AI-based tools via screen readers through a combination of semi-automated evaluations and inspections conducted by both sighted and blind accessibility experts and screen readers with more than 20 years of experience. Navigation, labeling of control elements, feedback mechanisms, and prompt handling were considered in the study. The results point to usability difficulties in all tools, particularly in navigation structure, clarity of feedback and interactive elements. Although this work empirically explores the accessibility of AI-based tools it brings out the first critical issues that deserve further investigation.

abstract = {Starting in November 2022 with the free provision of ChatGPT, large language models (LLM) are now publicly available. This has significantly increased the number of publications that scope potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The article analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the article aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

abstract = {Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of larger algorithmic models consumes substantially more energy than traditional models, contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and e-waste generation. To mitigate these impacts, big tech companies are developing different strategies such as turning to nuclear energy to meet the demand for GenAI electricity and avoid carbon emissions, an approach that could have profound social and environmental implications beyond carbon reduction.This paper proposes a critical rethinking of GenAI’s proliferation through an ecofeminist framing, which has historically interrogated the role of science and technology in the context of gender and environmental justice. To do so, it introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological and just transition alternatives within the AI research context, emphasising a critical examination of this technology’s role in the current socio-ecological crisis. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecological and feminist technological projects that prioritise and respect life, people, and the planet.},

This conjecture aligns with the development of AI-driven conversational agents, aiming to utilise advance natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance the capabilities of voice assistants. However, design guidelines for VAs prioritise maximum efficiency by advocating for the use of concise answers. This poses a conflict with the challenges around generative AI, such as inaccuracies and misinterpretation, as shorter responses may not adequately provide users with meaningful information. AI-VA systems can adapt drivers of trust formation, such as references and authorship, to improve credibility. A better understanding of user behaviour when using the system is needed to develop revised design recommendations for AI-powered VA systems. This paper reports an online survey of 256 participants residing in the U.K. and nine follow-up interviews, where user behaviour is investigated to identify drivers of trust in the context of obtaining digital information from a generative AI-based VA system. Adding references is promising as a tool for increasing trust in systems producing text, yet we found no evidence that the inclusion of references in a VA response contributed towards the perceived reliability or trust towards the system. We examine further variables driving user trust in AI-powered VA systems.},

By processing user-specific physiological characteristics and behavioral tendencies, the system dynamically generates personalized virtual entities. This approach empowers individuals from mere recipients of digital content to active participants in its creation. Furthermore, leveraging the TouchDesigner platform, the system constructs mixed-reality settings. Through the integration of sensor-based hardware and ComfyUI processing pipelines, it ensures immediate synchronization between users' real-time inputs and the generation of corresponding virtual characters.

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are increasingly used to access all sorts of services – like booking a flight, or setting a medical appointment – through natural language conversation. There are many technologies for implementing task-oriented chatbots, including Dialogflow, Watson, and Rasa. They rely on an explicit definition of the user intents, conversation flows, and chatbot outputs, which is costly to specify, and sometimes results in suboptimal user experiences and artificial conversations with limited diversity of chatbot responses. Recently, the advances in generative artificial intelligence fostered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new range of open-domain chatbots, like ChatGPT, able to converse fluently on any topic. However, they are general-purpose, and therefore not directly usable to solve specialised tasks reliably. In this paper, we study the power of LLMs to build task-oriented chatbots, resulting in lighter specifications – no intent definition required – and more natural conversations than in intent-based approaches. To this end, we propose a lightweight domain-specific language based on YAML to specify chatbots using modules of different types (e.g., menus, question-answering, data gathering). These specifications are compiled into structured LLM prompts that use the ReAct framework to inform our runtime how to interpret the user input and coordinate the tasks that the chatbot must perform. The paper presents the design and realisation of our framework, and an assessment that encodes a set of existing intent-based chatbots using our approach, showing its benefits in terms of specification size, conversation flexibility and output diversity.},

abstract = {Sketch mapping is an effective technique to externalize and communicate spatial information. However, it has been limited to 2D mediums, making it difficult to represent 3D information, particularly for terrains with elevation changes. We present Sketch2Terrain, an intuitive generative-3D-sketch-mapping system combining freehand sketching with generative Artificial Intelligence that radically changes sketch map creation and representation using Augmented Reality. Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments and provides a homogeneous interface for researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. A between-subject study (N=36) revealed that generative-3D-sketch-mapping improved efficiency by 38.4\%, terrain-topology accuracy by 12.5\%, and landmark accuracy by up to 12.1\%, with only a 4.7\% trade-off in terrain-elevation accuracy compared to freehand 3D-sketch-mapping. Additionally, generative-3D-sketch-mapping reduced perceived strain by 60.5\% and stress by 39.5\% over 2D-sketch-mapping. These findings underscore potential applications of generative-3D-sketch-mapping for in-depth understanding and accurate representation of vertically complex environments. The implementation is publicly available.},

abstract = {As researchers today, we are witnessing a fundamental change in our technologically-enabled world due to the advent and diffusion of highly disruptive technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). In particular, software engineering has been profoundly affected by the transformative power of disruptive innovations for decades, with a significant impact of technical advancements on social dynamics due to its socio-technical nature. In this article, we reflect on the importance of formulating and addressing research problems in software engineering through a socio-technical lens, thus ensuring a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena in this field. We propose a research playbook with the aim of providing a guide to formulate compelling and socially relevant research questions and to identify the appropriate research strategies for empirical investigations, with an eye on the long-term implications of technologies or their use. We showcase how to apply the research playbook. Firstly, we show how it can be used retrospectively to reflect on a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow, and its impact on software development. Secondly, we show how it can be used to question the impact of two current disruptive technologies: AI and AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a specialized GPT model to support the researcher in framing future investigations. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of adopting the playbook for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering and beyond.},

However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users’ ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies use gender information to un-derstand phenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the impact of the Covid pandemic response. Un-fortunately, most datasets do not include self-reported gender in-formation, which makes it necessary for researchers to infer gen-der from other information, such as from names or names and country information. In this paper, we compare the performance of the new generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three traditional commercially available list-based and ma-chine learning-based gender inference tools—Namsor, Gender-API, and genderize.io—on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first name and first \&amp; last name, with and without country information) impact the accuracy of their predictions. We find that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However, ChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outper-forms it, especially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is available. We conclude ChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction.},

These innovations promise more improved diagnoses and time-saving cost-effectiveness. However, GenAI’s rapid implementation poses significant challenges for meeting regulatory, ethical, and trustworthiness standards. These challenges include data privacy issues, reproducibility concerns, algorithmic bias in training data causing disparities in outcomes, and a lack of transparency and explainability. Unresolved, these issues could negatively affect the public’s confidence in and perception of GenAI systems. Addressing these challenges, international AI governance frameworks, including the EU AI Act and WHO guidelines, prioritize regulatory adherence, trustworthiness, and the explainability of healthcare AI systems. While such frameworks have expanded, a deficiency remains in translating policy into effective compliance mechanisms. We propose a Compliance Agentic Model (CAM) framework to help organizations comply with GenAI and machine learning (ML)-based solutions. The CAM framework establishes trustworthiness in GenAI applications used in healthcare, ensuring alignment with organizational values and ethical standards to enhance accountability and regulatory adherence.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies evolve at an unprecedented rate, global governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the technology, highlighting a critical issue in the governance adaptation of significant challenges. Depicting the nuances of nascent and diverse governance approaches based on risks, rules, outcomes, principles, or a mix, across different regions around the globe, is fundamental to discern discrepancies and convergences, and to shed light on specific limitations that need to be addressed, thereby facilitating the safe and trustworthy adoption of GenAI. In response to the need and the evolving nature of GenAI, this paper seeks to provide a collective view of different governance approaches around the world. Our research introduces a Harmonized GenAI Framework, "H-GenAIGF", based on the current governance approaches of six regions: (European Union (EU), United States (US), China (CN), Canada (CA), United Kingdom (UK), and Singapore (SG)). We have identified four constituents, fifteen processes, twenty-five sub-processes, and nine principles that aid the governance of GenAI, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state of GenAI governance. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to facilitate identification of common ground and distinctions based on coverage of the processes by each region. The results show that risk-based approaches allow for better coverage of the processes, followed by mixed approaches. Other approaches lag behind, covering less than 50\% of the processes. Most prominently, the analysis demonstrates that amongst the regions, only one process aligns across all approaches, highlighting the lack of consistent and executable provisions. Moreover, our case study on ChatGPT reveals process coverage deficiency, showing that harmonization of approaches is necessary to find alignment for GenAI governance.},

Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

Aimed at the AI and smart manufacturing's development in large volume and speed, English standard terminology could make international cooperation, information communication and industry standard more effective. There are main difficulties include the multidenoting and the obscurity of words, the rate new jargon, the confusion difference of industry and in language-culture difficulties, particularly language not English.For these challenges, the paper suggests ways: to establish authoritative terminology databases (i.e., ISO/TC 37) that regularly updates their definitions and use for latest version; to intensify collaborations of global and national standard bodies to create one single norm, develop one single standard to define their terminologies usage, to design for the rules of translation to reflect consistent terminologies use, and professionals’ terminology literacy in using terms. Three cases from authors show how those approaches help cross-industry and cross-cultural communications, including use of digital twin to advance the development of aircrafts, automotive, and automobile production in detail.Our research attempt combining linguistics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing engineering in the presentation of not only theoretical foundations but also practical references for assisting effective international cooperation and normalized development of AI and smart manufacturing. In the further study, we expand the case of study on larger ranges of cultures and industrial fields in order to realize more effective terminology standardization for the current emerging technologies.},

abstract = {In today's era, artificial intelligence technology is developing rapidly. Under such a background, translation quality evaluation system relying on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic in the field of translation research. Traditional manual evaluation methods have their own shortcomings, which are relatively subjective and low evaluation efficiency. The existing automatic assessment indicators such as BLEU and METEOR, which have deficiencies in cultural adaptability and logical coherence, cannot meet the complex needs of Sino-French alternating interpretation. This evaluation system combines multi-modal analysis with cross-language and cultural feature database. Based on the improvement of Transformer model architecture, a hierarchical evaluation mechanism is designed, which significantly improves the objectivity of evaluation and makes the evaluation more comprehensive. The experimental results show that this system has more advantages than the traditional method in the three core indicators of accuracy, fluency and cultural adaptability. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the score of this system and the human score reaches 0.87, which proves that it is effective in cross-language and cultural adaptation scenarios. This study provides an extensible technical framework for the assessment of translation quality, and provides innovative solutions to the challenges of linguistic structural differences and cultural metaphor translation.},

It was widely used and representative of the decoration of blue and white porcelain during the Ming Dynasty, with rich cultural connotations and aesthetic values. However, at present, its application in the field of artistic and creative products is difficult to meet the aesthetic and functional requirements of modern society. AIGC technology brings new opportunities for the innovative design of traditional patterns. However, there is still a lack of systematic research and practice at present. The application of AIGC technology to innovate the intertwining-branch auspicious floral pattern can not only enhance the artistic value of intangible cultural heritage cultural and creative products, but also meet modern demands and promote the inheritance and development of traditional culture. This study aims to explore the application of AIGC technology in the innovative design of the intertwining-branch auspicious floral pattern, introduce its artistic creation process and steps, and verify the effectiveness and feasibility of this method through questionnaire survey methods, experimental analysis methods, etc.},

abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Generative AI, the field of language education is undergoing profound technology-driven changes. Research has confirmed that AI tools have significantly improved language learning efficiency and equity through personalized learning path design, immediate feedback mechanisms, and multimodal resource supply, but the existing results are fragmented and lack cross-scenario theoretical integration and long-term impact assessment. To this end, using bibliometric methods, combined with CiteSpace and vosviewer tools, this paper systematically analyzes 209 high-quality documents on AI enabled language education in the web of science core database in the past eight years (2017-2025), and draws a knowledge map to reveal research trends and knowledge networks. The results show that the research focuses on three core directions - the application of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) in language skills training and emotional interaction, the optimization of AI-driven automated assessment systems, and the exploration of technology ethics and sociocultural adaptability. It provides a global perspective and empirical basis for the theoretical integration and practical optimization of AI enabled language education.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies like generative AI solutions are proliferating in the real-world healthcare sector. The purpose of this research is to investigate social norms, expectations, and standards of the elderly population for improving trust relationships while interacting with generative AI. The study is based on the CASA paradigm to gain a better understanding of the trust dynamics in human-computer communication to improve the adoption of GAI for elders' health and well-being. We validated the conceptual model with empirical data from 287 elderly users collected through an online and offline survey tool. Quantitative responses received were analysed using structural equation modeling. The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

abstract = {Project Based Learning (PBL) is a constructivist educational method. It addresses real-world problems and drives the learning process through collaborative exploration and iterative thinking among students. It shifts the educational goal from rote memorization of knowledge to the generation and development of abilities. However, PBL still faces many challenges in teaching implementation, mainly including three aspects: personalized project design, dynamic process guidance, and refined evaluation feedback. With the acceleration of digital transformation in education and the development of Large Scale Models technology, applying Generative AI to PBL will provide assistance for its effective implementation. Generative AI can assist in optimizing teaching project design, support personalized exploration processes for students, and achieve multi-dimensional ability assessment of students. At present, the application of Generative AI in PBL is in the exploratory stage. This article deconstructs the application of Generative AI in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Then, taking the exchange network construction teaching project as an example, it proposes the prompt language design of Generative AI in PBL teaching project design. Finally, it analyzes the potential risks brought by Generative AI. This study provides an implementation model and example for intelligent innovation in PBL.},

abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

abstract = {Digital productivity has become an important feature of new quality productive forces. Innovation and entrepreneurship education (IEE) in vocational colleges is an important component of China's higher education system.  Many scholars believe that the digital development of innovation and entrepreneurship in colleges will ultimately form a comprehensive digital ecosystem, in which digital platforms will play an important role. It is found that the application of digital technology on existing platforms is insufficient, digital resources are difficult to acquire, platforms lake correlation, and application platforms become formalistic. A comprehensive digital platform for innovation and entrepreneurship education in vocational colleges is constructed to solve the existing problems of platform digitalization. The application of the Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable the platform to process a large amount of text data. This article uses ChatGPT 4o as a representative for text sample processing, demonstrating the superiority of the model in platform applications. The digital development of platforms helps vocational colleges integrate into the digital ecosystem in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship education.},

A case study approach was adopted. 30 children diagnosed with dyslexia were selected and divided into the experimental group. The pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate the students' learning progress in terms of pinyin spelling, Chinese character writing, grammar correction and writing fluency. At the same time, the feedback from students and parents was collected to analyze the acceptance of feedback and learning attitude. The research results show that ChatGPT feedback has shown significant results in pinyin learning, Chinese character writing and grammar correction, especially in improving students' learning motivation and writing fluency. ChatGPT's feedback still has certain limitations in the processing of depth and complex grammatical problems. Students are more active in participating in ChatGPT feedback and generally feel that its feedback is more immediate and operational. ChatGPT has positive potential in assisting children with dyslexia in learning Chinese, especially in giving personalized learning feedback and reducing cognitive burden. However, the quality and depth of feedback need to be further optimized.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positively grasped as promising to disrupt the higher education system but it also poses a number of challenges. Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

abstract = {This study systematically reviews the feasibility of dialogue learning based on generative AI. Research on mixed reality and generative AI in enhancing teaching effectiveness is increasingly in-depth both domestically and internationally. The development and application of mixed reality and generative AI are accelerating, evolving classroom structures and methods. In the context of rapid social, economic, and technological development, students require more personalized and innovative education, which dialogue learning interventions based on generative AI can effectively address. Through a systematic literature review method, 128 relevant studies from the past decade were systematically analyzed to explore the feasibility of dialogue learning in the context of generative AI. The study finds that the application of generative AI in dialogue learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also excels in personalized learning and timely feedback. However, the diversity and operability of technological implementation and application scenarios require further exploration. This research provides references and insights for future studies by related scholars.},

abstract = {Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 ''in the wild'' image–text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to ''in the wild'' content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.},

In the context of the rapid development of information technology, e-commerce platforms actively use and explore innovative applications of ICS to improve user shopping experience. Exploring the user's acceptance and satisfaction of ICS is still an important topic in current research and practice. This study combined Customer Satisfaction Barometer (CSB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), collected data through questionnaire survey, and then used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster data to identify different behaviors and preference patterns of users when using ICS. Then, CHAID algorithm is used in each cluster to dig deeply into the key factors affecting users' acceptance of ICS, and then obtain the key factors of user satisfaction and their interaction relationship. Research data showed that Cronbach's Alpha=0.874 and KMO=0.8. The results show that a stable, reliable, accurate, efficient, intuitive understanding and caring ICS system is the key to improving user satisfaction.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problem that the “single-dimension” teaching effect evaluation, which is mainly based on the result evaluation, cannot effectively evaluate the students' learning effect in the online and offline teaching mode, we constructed a “competence-oriented multi-dimension teaching effect evaluation model”. Based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the model constructs a competence evaluation system with four evaluation dimensions: self learning, hands-on practice, innovative thinking and collaborative learning to evaluate students' learning effects. The weights of the indicators at all levels were calculated by AHP, and the competence evaluation model was constructed based on machine learning and validated to ensure the scientificity and rationality of the evaluation. Taking the Data Structure and Algorithms course as a practical case, relying on diversified online teaching platforms, course knowledge map and AI tools, we collect students' learning process data through multiple channels, and utilize the model to conduct a multi-dimensional and comprehensive evaluation of students' learning effects. The research and practice show that the model provides powerful data support for the evaluation and improvement of students' practical ability, comprehensive quality and personalized learning effect.},

Drawing on interviews with 23 university students, analyzed using Nvivo 14, the research investigates learner perspectives on Gen AI's influence on their inquiry processes. Students reported that Gen AI significantly supports language acquisition and enables personalized learning pathways. Furthermore, Gen AI was perceived to influence cognitive processes central to inquiry, such as reflection and critical thinking, and to contribute to a reshaping of learning dynamics. The findings demonstrate Gen AI's potential to enhance and potentially reshape IBL practices in FLT by expanding resource availability and fostering individualization, thereby underscoring the necessity for critical pedagogic integration. This research provides an empirically grounded understanding of student perspectives on the Gen AI-IBL synergy in FLT, contributing to the fields of applied linguistics and educational technology.},

abstract = {Cooperation between the United States and China, the world’s leading artificial intelligence (AI) powers, is crucial for effective global AI governance and responsible AI development. Although geopolitical tensions have emphasized areas of conflict, in this work, we identify potential common ground for productive dialogue by conducting a systematic analysis of more than 40 primary AI policy and corporate governance documents from both nations. Specifically, using an adapted version of the AI Governance and Regulatory Archive (AGORA) — a comprehensive repository of global AI governance documents — we analyze these materials in their original languages to identify areas of convergence in (1) sociotechnical risk perception and (2) governance approaches. We find strong and moderate overlap in several areas such as on concerns about algorithmic transparency, system reliability, agreement on the importance of inclusive multi-stakeholder engagement, and AI’s role in enhancing safety. These findings suggest that despite strategic competition, there exist concrete opportunities for bilateral U.S.-China cooperation in the development of responsible AI. Thus, we present recommendations for furthering diplomatic dialogues that can facilitate such cooperation. Our analysis contributes to understanding how different international governance frameworks might be harmonized to promote global responsible AI development.},

abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust.

Using a passive viewing eye-tracking paradigm, we explored the differences in visuospatial attention for free vs. guided viewing of human- vs. AI-generated scene photographs and paintings. Aesthetic ratings and fixation data were collected for each image, and heatmaps were generated to determine the spatial distribution of gaze. This work has the potential to reveal crucial differences in the visual processing and subsequent aesthetic evaluation of scene images of various sources and styles, and characterize what factors – if any – differentiate AI images from human creations.},

abstract = {ChatGPT potential value in education is broadly recognized and many studies report experiments of its use inside or outside the classroom by students and teachers. On the other hand, the use of ChatGPT rises lots of concerns about well-known problems such as hallucination, plagiarism, overreliance, or misinformation. It is of primary importance to teach students a correct and constructive use of ChatGPT and a critical approach to its returned outputs. The paper presents a classroom experience where students were asked to interact with ChatGPT in the context of a database course. The declared challenge for the students was, given a set of predefined relational database schemata, to invent questions for ChatGPT and try to force wrong SQL solutions. Students had to record the question, the ChatGPT solution, their solution, and the comments about the eventual ChatGPT syntactical and/or semantical errors. This gamification approach was meant to enhance students' motivation, but the main teachers' goal was to make them reflect critically (i) on ChatGPT output, experiencing that it does make mistakes, (ii) on the interpretation of ChatGPT errors, and (iii) on the possible strategies for forcing ChatGPT errors. The experiment involved 166 B.S. students in Engineering and the collected data have been analyzed under different points of view to get an insight into the approach and the critical attitude of the students. The paper reports the results of this analysis and discusses the impact of the activity on learning by analyzing the correlation between students' participation and exam performance.},

abstract = {We live in a time when unprecedented technological abundance stands in a perplexingly stark contrast to a precarious future, declining mental health and increasing disengagement from work. Past work has emphasized positive user experiences as a desirable design goal in designing interactive systems. Yet, researchers argue that to flourish, we need to cultivate phronesis, or practical wisdom which results from a successful integration of virtues, or character strengths. The design of technology embeds value judgments about what is worthwhile, and to the extent that interactive technologies can both positively and negatively shape our decisions, influence our motivations, and form our habits, the question arises: how can we design them to help us inculcate those patterns of thought and behavior which contribute to our ability to use technological affordances prudently and cultivate well-being supportive virtues? The aim of this one day in-person workshop is to bring together researchers to deepen our understanding of the overlap between design, flourishing and the role of virtues, and develop fruitful avenues for further research and collaboration.},

Using photographs recovered from historical archives, images that documented everyday reality (1900-1930), AI is integrated into the creative process to offer a speculative prediction of the moments captured in silver gelatin. Apparently, they are fictitious recreations generated by AI, however, the piece visually explores, from the generated story, the intersubjective mechanisms in which we build our historical memory. It is a dialogue with the past to develop a story of the future recreated by an algorithm that has been fed by collective imaginaries. A technology that allows us to observe not only the shadows projected in the cave, but also the fire that generates them, the objects that create these shadows and the forces that control the experience.},

abstract = {Mental Health (MH) is fundamental to overall well-being, yet Mental Health Literacy (MHL) remains low despite growing awareness. Many individuals feel uncomfortable discussing MH due to persistent stigma, leading to misconceptions, discrimination, and reluctance to seek help. Reducing stigma requires education and open dialogue. Games have been widely recognized as effective tools for learning, and digital platforms increasingly play a role in MH interventions by offering engaging, interactive experiences. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are being adopted across various domains for answering questions and facilitating learning. However, when it comes to sensitive topics like MH, users may hesitate to engage with AI-driven models or be unaware of the proper ways to ask questions to the model. Moreover, the potential of AI-powered game agents in MH educational context remains largely unexplored. My research investigates the design of interventions that integrate game-based learning with AI-driven conversational agents as Non-Player Characters (NPC) to promote awareness of MH, encourage self-reflection, and reduce stigma. Using a Research Through Design approach, I develop and evaluate prototypes where users engage with games and a chatbot to explore MH topics. The findings aim to contribute to the "Artifacts and Systems" domain by providing insights into designing effective and engaging digital MH interventions.},

This study used a qualitative content analysis of 40 publicly available YouTube videos showing individuals with I/DD using ACC. Several barriers were observed, including screen glare, eye-tracking fatigue, long training periods, as well as cost and maintenance issues. AAC supported greater independence, improved learning, and better participation when the technologies worked well. Based on our findings, we advocate for future work to use participatory design methods when developing new AAC devices, use existing technologies to reduce initial and maintenance costs, and follow a competency-based approach to designing future AAC devices to lower steep learning curves with the adoption of AAC devices.},

abstract = {The rise of AI coding assistants, like GitHub Copilot, is transforming software development. These tools promise productivity gains and support for various tasks, from code generation to explain legacy systems. However, their integration into education raises pedagogical challenges: How can we use their potential without compromising students' autonomy and mastery of fundamental concepts? How can we stay critical of their limitations?This paper explores these questions through a structured educational experience. It is based on a guided tutorial designed to confront students with the assistants' limitations. A simultaneous questionnaire is provided to allow students to take the necessary time to thoroughly analyze the assistant's responses. The tutorial has three stages. It introduces students to real-world scenarios of increasing complexity: getting started, implementing business rules, and working on a legacy project.This approach helps develop skills such as critical thinking, prompt refinement, and error correction. The results also show that well-supervised use of coding assistants can enhance teaching in testing and working with legacy code. They help students overcome initial roadblocks and encourage them to think about best practices. Furthermore, students themselves highlight the importance of supervising these tools to maintain their autonomy.},

However, integrating GenAI across game development phases presents unique technical, creative, and collaborative challenges. This study aims to develop an adaptable framework that addresses these challenges by providing practical insights and strategies to enhance collaboration, creativity, and efficiency. Using a mixed-methods approach, including open-source analysis and developer surveys and interviews, we will construct a grounded theory on GenAI adoption.

abstract = {With the continuous development of science and technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important driving force for innovation in the field of education, especially advanced AI language models such as ChatGPT, which shows great potential in assisting teachers to design, implement and evaluate personalised teaching due to its excellent language comprehension and generative ability. Nevertheless, how to use ChatGPT to help teachers carry out personalised teaching has yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the ways in which ChatGPT can help teachers carry out personalised teaching based on the connotation of ChatGPT and personalised teaching, and discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in carrying out personalised teaching, from the perspective of the three aspects of teaching: lesson planning, instruction, and evaluation and feedback. It also discusses the challenges faced when using ChatGPT to assist teachers in personalised teaching and proposes strategies to address them. The study shows that artificial intelligence can make teachers more scientific, precise, intelligent and diversified in the process of implementing personalised teaching.},

abstract = {Wisdom education in the era of digital intelligence emphasizes the use of intelligent technology to empower education. It can integrate data wisdom, educational wisdom, and cultural wisdom to achieve the precision, creation, and optimization of education, and cultivate learners' wisdom literacy. Due to the potential problems in algorithm, calculation data, and computing power and other aspects of problems in intelligent technology, as well as due to human-related factors such as emotional barriers and management's losing control, wisdom education in the era of digital intelligence faces many risks. This paper applies the methods of philosophical speculation, ethical analysis, emotional analysis, and teaching pathology analysis to study the four major risks in them. (alienation of educational nature, human-machine ethical anomie, lack of artificial emotion, and pathological teaching), and intending to find the resolutions of the corresponding risks in wisdom education. The supposed resolutions are empowering the human-like nature of educational artificial intelligence and combining it with moral education to obtain a complete educaitonal nature of wisdom education; strengthening the governance of human-machine ethics from the source of risk (participants) through the utilization of intelligent educational ethical norms; combining human emotions with artificial emotions to establish a soul that is inclined to goodness of intelligent education; inhibiting pathogenic factors and enhancing disease resistance factors treat teaching diseases and prevent effectively through various therapies.},

This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape of AIGC detection technologies. We begin by chronicling the evolution of generative models, from foundational GANs to state-of-the-art diffusion and transformer-based architectures. We then systematically review detection methodologies across all modalities, organizing them into a novel taxonomy of External Detection and Internal Detection. For each modality, we trace the technical progression from early feature-based methods to advanced deep learning, while also covering critical tasks like model attribution and tampered region localization. Furthermore, we survey the ecosystem of publicly available detection tools and practical applications. Finally, we distill the primary challenges facing the field–including generalization, robustness, interpretability, and the lack of universal benchmarks–and conclude by outlining key future directions, such as the development of holistic AI Safety Agents, dynamic evaluation standards, and AI-driven governance frameworks. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a clear, in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art and critical frontiers in the ongoing endeavor to ensure a safe and trustworthy AIGC ecosystem.},

Since CUREs originated in biological sciences, there are unique challenges to adapting the CURE model for computer science. We designed a CURE by aligning its principles with entrepreneurial mindset (EM) and software development practices by applying them in a programming project. This experience report introduces the design and adoption of a CURE project for an introductory programming class (CS1).The CURE project aims to innovate color selection for digital visualizations by facilitating easier interpretation and improved accessibility for people with color vision deficiencies. We designed the "color vision project" to engage students in developing novel algorithms for issues in color accessibility, which replaced traditional, auto-graded programming projects. The project includes multiple deliverables for students to demonstrate authentic software development practices while incrementally adapting to new discoveries.Over three semesters, we gathered surveys (n=62) to gauge students' connections with scientific practices and entrepreneurial mindsets. Survey responses indicate that students identified with both CURE and EM. We also offer reflections on continuing to improve CURE implementations in computer science and give recommendations on how to mitigate the misuse of artificial intelligence in CURE projects.},

abstract = {As the technology behind large language models advances rapidly, AI-generated content (AIGC) pervades our daily lives. Classifiers that identify AIGC play a crucial role in distinguishing between text generated by humans and that generated by artificial intelligence. In order to better prevent the abuse of AIGC and reduce the emergence of issues such as false information, academic misconduct, and deceptive comments, we introduced the task of AIGC classifiers, emphasizing the necessity of classifier development in this era. The essence of AIGC identification tasks lies in binary classification, aiming to discern whether a piece of content is created by artificial intelligence. In recent years, white-box and black-box methods as classifiers for identifying AIGC have made significant strides. In this paper, we curated the main research achievements in the field of AIGC identification, emphasizing the crucial role of comprehensive and excellent datasets in constructing AIGC recognition classifiers. Additionally, we explored the limitations and development goals of current popular datasets, as well as potential datasets. Furthermore, we analyzed paradigms of various classifiers, addressing challenges such as multidomain recognition tasks, cross-language recognition tasks, and data ambiguity issues. Finally, we proposed pathways for the future development of AIGC identification. This study aims to provide a clear overview for relevant researchers and offer constructive suggestions for constructing more stable and efficient classifiers.},

Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments. A holistic mixed-method approach by combining subjective and objective measures in a developer-centered manner is taken.},

abstract = {University students' adoption of generative AI tools in educational contexts is investigated in this research through two complementary studies. A Jordanian-based cross-sectional study (N=95) initially established the middle students' familiarity (M=3.14, SD=0.81) with generative AI writing tools, along with significant concerns about misinformation/data security (M=3.35, SD=0.85), but high awareness regarding advantages for creativity simulation and innovation facilitation (M=3.62, SD=0.81). Second, a Chinese UTAUT-based research (N=361) employing SEM-ANN hybrid analysis found that DeepSeek adoption intention is significantly determined by Perceived Price (β=0.346), Performance Expectancy (β=0.244), Effort Expectancy (β=0.233), eXplainable AI (β=0.126), and Facilitating Conditions (β=0.084), while Social Influence did not appear to be significant (β=−0.019). Moderator analysis found gender and education level to significantly moderate some predictor-intention relationships. Synthetically, these findings demonstrate: (a) cultural consensus in recognition of AI's value for learning in various capacities despite technical challenges, (b) the critical role of cost disclosure, usability, and explainability in adoption, and (c) stratified intervention needs to address technical instruction, ethical literacy, cost reduction, and maximization of usability – particularly through personalized learning deployments. The study supports the UTAUT's efficacy for use in AI adoption studies while enriching methodology integration through SEM-ANN methods.},

These background factors affect student understanding of the world, and, consequently, their work in computing ethic classes. Instructors of computing ethics courses therefore must facilitate topics that are not only pertinent to modern technologies but that are also interesting for students from a range of backgrounds. In this work, we introduce a low-overhead, natural language processing tool that can assist instructors in extracting student talking points from over 600 discussion forum posts in a large-scale undergraduate computing ethics course. When compared to large language model approaches, this n-gram-based scripting tool is more effective in selecting popular quotes and summarizing course discussion. This tool is simple in implementation and can be easily adapted by instructors to prepare for classroom discussion.},

abstract = {Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) are accounts of connected events (a story) represented on digital systems. Through interactivity, IDNs afford ways for users to directly engage with the information embedded in the system’s rules in an accessible manner that taps into the user’s conscious, reflective learning abilities. IDN research is relatively new and there is much to be done to harness IDNs’ storytelling potential, requiring insights from fields such as Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Media \&amp; Communication Studies, and Narrative Studies. This workshop brings together researchers from these and other related fields to develop practical, communal knowledge for Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN) design. Our focus is storytelling structures, techniques, and traditions that could support digital audience/user-interactions. By developing communal knowledge, we can assist IDN designers in the creation of engaging, impactful narrative experiences and guide IDN researchers toward future areas of study.},

abstract = {We are concurrently witnessing two significant shifts: voice and chat-based conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming ubiquitous (especially more recently due to advances in generative AI and LLMs - large language models), and older people are becoming a very large demographic group (and increasingly adopting of mobile technology on which such interfaces are present). However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three scenarios in which Amazon Alexa presented data used for personalization differently (i.e., voice recordings vs. voice profiles + text transcripts vs. text transcripts only). Users’ perceived information sensitivity across different data types was also surveyed. The main findings include that users distinguish voice interaction data from other types of personal information, and those who report higher data sensitivity over voice interaction data assess its privacy risks higher. Furthermore, only using text transcripts (without voice profiles) for personalization alleviated users’ perceived privacy risk. This study informs future privacy implications for data transparency and design to incorporate modality differences in user data collected, stored, and processed towards personalization of voice-enabled CUIs (like OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini) that extend traditional voice assistants (like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri).},

abstract = {As a leading threat to human health, trauma is the primary cause of death among individuals under 40, making its prevention and treatment undeniably important. To effectively prevent and treat trauma, it is crucial to deeply understand the patterns of trauma occurrence, key points of treatment, and the final rehabilitation status. Especially under the conditions of first - line treatment, rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment of trauma are of vital significance for ensuring the life safety of the injured and promoting the recovery of injuries. However, the current field of trauma medicine faces issues such as information silos and insufficient level of intelligence. Therefore, this paper proposes to construct an injury knowledge graph by integrating multi - source heterogeneous data and combining medical logic, aiming to provide structured management and visual query of trauma medical knowledge, improve diagnostic efficiency and medical support capabilities, offer efficient knowledge query and reasoning capabilities, meet the needs of future intelligent on - site medical care, and provide a data basis for the recommendation of personalized treatment plans.},

Using a combination of Flesch-Kincaid readability and polarity scores, we analyze changes in text complexity and sentiment. Our findings reveal a significant increase in mean sentiment polarity (0.12 vs. 0.04) and a shift from predominantly neutral content (54.8\% in 2020 to 39.8\% in 2024) to more positive expressions (28.6\% to 45.9\%).

This study uses a combination of qualitative research and quantitative research to verify and test the operational approach of personalized learning. Questionnaires, collection of academic outcome data, interviews and case studies can help us find that proper use of personalized learning plans will greatly enhance academic performance and student satisfaction. This study confirms that the application of personalized learning methods can significantly improve academic performance and satisfaction, but we also find that these issues need to be addressed in the application of technology, in the provision of educational resources and investment, and in the autonomy of teachers and students, as well as in the continuous provision of independent learning opportunities for students. This study provides practical policy suggestions for government education policy makers, university administrators and teachers, including personalized education policy, resource allocation, teacher training, interdisciplinary learning environment, etc. Moreover, this study has revealed some issues worth paying attention to in personalized learning methods, such as the long-term impact of personalized learning models, the impact of multi-disciplinary fields, and the integration of technologies.},

Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that different from cargo cult development. In this short paper we discuss the implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the central issues associated with this approach.},

NLP algorithms were programmed to process speech and analyze two modalities of verbal toxicity: text content and audio features. User experience heuristics in learning, feedback, visual appearance, and interaction were applied alongside player testing with 10 participants to develop a refined prototype. The intervention system was designed to optimize specific conditions of strong player experience, player-system cooperation, and the use of operant conditioning to correct toxic behavior.},

By creating intelligent digital agents designed after individuals, pets, or objects familiar to older adults, these agents aim to unobtrusively investigate how the residential environment influences daily routines among older people. Insights gained through natural interactions in MR can inform the design of residential spaces, better satisfying the needs of aging populations. This proposed approach aims to improve both home redevelopments and future residential designs for older adults.},

However, conversational agents attend only expected cases of participation, that is, those based on e-consulting, e-decision making and e-informing. Hence, chatbots don´t concern non mapped cases of self-mobilization, besides there are problems in human-computer communication and in the transmission of information caused by digital divide that hinder peoples ‘participation. Literature review indicates that generative AI chatbot shall be used in non-expected interactions between human and conversational agents. Therefore, this paper discusses how chatbots could interact within self-mobilizations’ types of digital participation, concerning obstacles like lack of infrastructure and digital illiteracy. Using design science research, we propose the GenPart, a generative AI-chatbot model for enhancing people´s digital participation. We claim that this artifact can be used by researchers and practitioners who want to promote the integration between people, organizations, and information in digital platforms, promoting citizen participation and civic engagement.},

abstract = {This workshop introduces generative AI applications for enterprise, with a focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Generative AI is a field of artificial intelligence that can create new content and solve complex problems. RAG systems are a novel generative AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to generate rich and diverse responses. RAG systems can leverage enterprise data, which is often specific, structured, and dynamic, to provide customized solutions for various domains. However, enterprise data also poses challenges such as scalability, security, and data quality. This workshop convenes researchers and practitioners to explore RAG and other generative AI systems in real-world enterprise scenarios, fostering knowledge exchange, collaboration, and identification of future directions. Relevant to the CIKM community, the workshop intersects with core areas of data science and machine learning, offering potential benefits across various domains.},

Based on the literature in the field of artificial intelligence ethics in  China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) academic journal database from 2013-2024, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of its research hot trends using social network analysis. The research results indicate that research in the field of artificial intelligence ethics has begun to take shape, but  the density of networks  is relatively low, and the connections between different research topics are not close enough. Current research mainly focuses on ethical considerations at the algorithmic and technical levels, as well as their potential impact on the moral framework of human society. The research results lack innovation and tend to be repetitive. The ethical research on artificial intelligence has formed four relatively stable subgroups, reflecting the diverse paths of ethical governance in artificial intelligence and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. This study provides a useful reference and scientific basis for in-depth understanding of the current situation and trend of artificial intelligence ethics research in China, and improving the future research direction and policy measures.},

abstract = {There are a large number of violations of safety regulations at the construction site of the power grid. These behaviors do not comply with safety supervision norms and can cause significant safety hazards. In response to the problem of difficulty in capturing and alerting such violations, we have designed an intelligent recognition system for violations based on enhanced YOLOv5 and generative visual big models to automatically detect violations and potential safety hazards at the construction site of the power grid. We have constructed a private dataset of violations at the construction site of the power grid. In our improved YOLOv5 model, we first added a spatial channel attention mechanism to the Neck section of Yolov5 to enhance its ability to extract spatial features and distinguish between different channel features, enabling the network to better distinguish different targets. In addition, we have added a spatial attention mechanism after the SPP of the backbone network, which enables the network to fully utilize spatial information, extract more prominent features, and improve the accuracy and recall of the model. In addition, to compensate for the lack of negative samples in the dataset, we use a generative visual model to generate a large number of negative sample images to enhance the dataset and address the issue of insufficient negative samples. We have designed a real-time safety supervision intelligent system for detecting violations on construction sites based on the above model and method, using IoT devices such as on-site real-time cameras, intermediate data servers, and routers. We conducted extensive experiments on real construction site datasets, and the results showed that our method has significantly improved compared to the original model. The MAP of the system is 94.0\%, indicating that the model has strong detection ability and robustness in identifying personnel and safety tools in power grid construction site scenarios.},

abstract = {AI has been widely integrated into web applications, and has revolutionized user experiences by enabling personalized services, optimizing decision-making and enhancing productivity. However, AI for the web application also poses significant sustainability challenges. AI models rely heavily on vast amounts of web data, consuming substantial computational resources and energy, while the proliferation of AI-generated content risks polluting the web with low-quality information and misinformation. This degradation of data quality threatens the robustness, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI systems, raising concerns about security, bias, and equitable outcomes across diverse user groups. Therefore, we propose this workshop that aims to advance research in sustainable AI for the web, focusing on energy-efficient, socially equitable, and technically robust AI models. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among AI, environmental science and social sciences experts, the workshop seeks to develop innovative solutions that ensure AI's long-term positive impact on the web.},

Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges faced by students during the transition to university, particularly in sports education, where students’ expectations often do not align with course designs. Students typically enter university with unrealistic academic expectations and lack necessary self-regulation skills, which negatively affect their academic success. Traditional methods of evaluating sports courses, such as expert-designed questionnaires, oversimplify students’ experiences and fail to capture the complexity of their feedback. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on sentiment analysis, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to better understand students’ multidimensional evaluations of sports courses. By employing transfer learning techniques, such as fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (e.g., Qwen-2.5 3B), this method provides a more refined and detailed analysis of student feedback. The proposed system not only quantifies students’ emotional feedback on various aspects of the course but also reflects on how these insights can guide course improvements. This paper emphasizes the importance of accurately capturing student experiences to improve course content, teaching methods, and overall student satisfaction, offering valuable contributions to the field of sports management.},

Alt text is indispensable for visually impaired individuals to understand visual content through assistive technologies. Nonetheless, the manual generation of high-quality alt text at scale continues to pose a considerable difficulty because of the requisite skill and time involved.This paper introduces AltGen, a framework utilizing generative AI to automate the development of alt text for EPUB files. AltGen uses pre-trained transformer models to provide descriptive and contextually pertinent alt text. It employs a structured process encompassing data extraction, visual content analysis with computer vision models (e.g., CLIP, ViT), and context-sensitive text generation utilizing fine-tuned large language models. The produced alt-text is assessed by computational measures, including cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative input from visually challenged individuals. Experimental findings demonstrate that AltGen lowers accessibility errors by 97.5\%, with participants noting substantial enhancements in content understanding and usability.},

In this work, we present Twin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to progressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process, Twin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue agent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is generated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized dialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to evolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to progressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by reducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the generated images, streamlining creative process across various applications.},

The findings revealed that while LLMs positively influenced students' capacity to develop complex applications, work with Python libraries, and write quality code, they had no significant impact on students' grasp of fundamental Python concepts or their general comfort with the language. These results suggest that LLMs serve as effective tools for advancing practical programming skills but cannot substitute for the foundational programming knowledge that must be developed through traditional learning.},

abstract = {The precise detection of workers through on-site surveillance videos is crucial for enhancing the intelligent management of construction safety. This paper introduces an improved lightweight network, Yolov5s-NSFnet, which builds upon the original Yolov5s model to effectively address the challenges associated with small object detection and real-time processing on embedded devices in surveillance settings. To mitigate the difficulties posed by long monitoring distances and the detection of workers as small targets, we enhance the Yolov5s architecture by replacing its backbone network with the more efficient FasterNet. Moreover, we have incorporated SE channel attention mechanism into the FasterNet block to enhance the feature extraction capability of critical channels. Finally, we use the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) loss function instead of the traditional loss function to improve the accuracy of small object detection in the dataset. The experimental results show that our method not only effectively reduces the number of network parameters and computational load, but also improves the detection speed of the model on embedded devices while maintaining good detection accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce RevisitAffectiveMemory, a novel task designed to reconstruct autobiographical memories through audio-visual generation guided by affect extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To support this pioneering task, we present the EEG-AffectiveMemory dataset, which encompasses textual descriptions, visuals, music, and EEG recordings collected during memory recall from nine participants. Furthermore, we propose RYM (Revisit Your Memory), a three-stage framework for generating synchronized audio-visual contents while maintaining dynamic personal memory affect trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate our method successfully decodes individual affect dynamics trajectories from neural signals during memory recall (F1=0.9). Also, our approach faithfully reconstructs affect-contextualized audio-visual memory across all subjects, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with participants reporting strong affective concordance between their recalled memories and the generated content. Especially, contents generated from subject-reported affect dynamics showed higher correlation with participants' reported affect dynamics trajectories (r=0.265, p&lt;.05) and received stronger user preference (preference=56\%) compared to those generated from randomly reordered affect dynamics. Our approaches advance affect decoding research and its practical applications in personalized media creation via neural-based affect comprehension.

This paper presented “dream relay,” a novel approach to sharing dreams by integrating GAI. In the relay, participants used a dream probe to record their dreams, which were then visualized by GAI and shared with the next person as stimuli. We conducted a probe-based, group autoethnography study to explore how dream sharing was influenced in the way of relay and with GAI. Results showed how participants recorded their dreams and perceived the AI-generated dream visuals. This study also highlighted the value of GAI in sparking imagination and alleviating personal privacy concerns, which increased the willingness to share. Finally, we discussed the human-AI collaboration in reshaping dreams, as well as the role of GAI in facilitating social interaction.},

abstract = {In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25\texttimes{} per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20–50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.},

The development of a substantial model-based intelligent library system has been undertaken, integrating an AI teaching assistant, a knowledge graph, and a recommendation engine based on deep learning. The system is capable of accurately matching resources based on learners' cognitive characteristics. The proposed hybrid teaching model integrates online and offline components and is based on an “AI two-teacher collaboration” mechanism. This collaboration facilitates cognitive construction and teacher guidance for value enhancement. The model also introduces a data-driven, industry-embedded context. The data-driven, three-dimensional teaching framework encompasses industry context embedding, cognitive apprenticeship and value immersion education. A multidimensional assessment system combining formative and summative assessment was adopted, and the assessment methods were reorganized. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the model significantly enhances students' data analysis and comprehensive abilities, while concomitantly improving teaching efficacy, students' performance, competition results, and course evaluation. It can be used as a reference paradigm for the reform of business courses in the smart era.},

abstract = {Human behavior and interactions are profoundly influenced by visual stimuli present in their surroundings. This influence extends to various aspects of life, notably food consumption and selection. In our study, we employed various models to extract different attributes from the environmental images. Specifically, we identify five key attributes and employ an ensemble model IMVB7 based on five distinct models for some of their detection resulted 0.85 mark. In addition, we conducted surveys to discern patterns in food preferences in response to visual stimuli. Leveraging the insights gleaned from these surveys, we formulate recommendations using decision tree for dishes based on the amalgamation of identified attributes resulted IMVB7t 0.96 mark.

abstract = {As the smart tourism sector is growing rapidly, large language models (LLMs) have emerged to slowly function as an emerging technology for enhancing the tourist experience. The present study statistically tested the worth of having LLMs as virtual guides in smart tourist scenarios. It comparatively evaluated and analyzed their efficacy and quality in gaining information, user experience, and willingness to use among different age groups. This study recruited 180 tourists in three age categories (Digital Natives, Digital Adopters, and Digital Migrants) via a stratified random sampling method. They were equally assigned to the experimental group and the control group. When compared with conventional tourism digital media, the results showed that virtual tour guides derived from LLMs had tremendous advantages in increasing information acquisition effectiveness, raising interactivity, and optimizing user experience. However, acceptability of LLMs virtual guides was different among people of different ages. Digital Natives and Digital Migrants were more contented and yet willing to accept, while Digital Adopters showed a neutral attitude toward LLMs' profound content. The current study also revealed the key problems of LLMs in intelligent tourism, e.g., information credibility and interactive adaptability. The findings provide theoretical support for digital innovation in smart tourism and practical insights for policymakers, tourism technology companies, and cultural managers.},

abstract = {Deepfakes have posed significant risks to personal privacy and reputation. At present, active defense measures often introduce imperceptible adversarial perturbations into the protected images, aiming to disrupt the normal forgery of deepfake models. Among them, generative perturbations are favored because of their higher efficiency. However, the existing generative perturbations are mainly based on the Lp-norm method, which still has the problem of high perception and difficulty in achieving personalized strength. To address this shortcoming, we propose an adaptive deepfake adversarial perturbation generation method based on a diffusion model. Initially, our approach constructs an adversarial denoising framework that utilizes the reverse process of diffusion model to learn unrestricted perturbations. Then an adversarial guided mechanism is introduced during the sampling stage, enabling the adaptive control of the adversarial perturbation through sampling step and guidance strength. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves effective defense effects on various typical deepfake models and has good adaptive generation capabilities.},

abstract = {Under the dual challenges of intelligent transformation and insufficient profitability of automobile manufacturing industry, the traditional financial control model is difficult to adapt to the dynamic market environment due to the problems of data silo and decision-making lag. Based on the framework of dynamic capability theory and the exploratory case of XX Automobile, this study adopts big data technology, machine learning algorithms, and combines blockchain, Internet of Things, database and other information technologies to systematically reveal the intrinsic mechanism of financial control innovation driven by the integration of industry finance and tax. The study found that: (1) Dynamic capabilities empower financial control innovation through the three phases of "sensing-capturing-reconstructing": Relying on big data technology to accurately identify the core drivers of ROE downturn, using machine learning models (decision tree, K-means clustering) to optimize the forecast of capital demand and supplier screening, and reorganizing the financial control innovation with the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the study found that: (2) The dynamic ability of the financial management system is a key factor in financial management innovation. With the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the company reconstructs the whole value chain process of procurement, cost and sales, and realizes the in-depth synergy of industry finance and tax data. (2) At the practical level, green bond financing reduces capital costs by 30\%, intelligent production line siting model significantly improves work efficiency and reduces carbon emissions by 117,300 tons, and RFM analysis and regression analysis accurately locate high-value customers and Belt and Road potential markets to promote export revenue growth. The conclusion of the study shows that dynamic capability theory provides an innovative path of "technology empowerment-decision optimization-strategic leap" for the integration of industry finance and tax, which not only verifies its theoretical applicability in the field of finance, but also provides a replicable practical paradigm for digital transformation of the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time contributes to the strategic insights of green finance and ESG governance.},

abstract = {In the Natural Language Processing (NLP), BLEU and F1 have served as standard evaluation metrics for a long time and their ability to evaluate modern chatbot systems is becoming less reliable. These metrics are primarily designed to evaluate machine translation and classification of tasks, but they fail to capture the evolving intent alignment, conversational complexity, emotional nuance, and dynamic user interaction patterns that are commonly found in present day's generative AI-powered chatbot systems. Through this paper, while we are critically examining the shortcomings of single-metric evaluations, we also introduce a robust and comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework that perfectly suits the contemporary chatbot architectures. Bridging theory and deployment together, our evaluation model incorporates findings from academic research, industry case studies, and hands-on experiments to assess coherence, contextual understanding, goal accuracy, safety compliance, and user satisfaction. By integrating both automatic and human-centric metrics, we subsequently outline a modular evaluation suite. This framework is applied across enterprise-level and open-domain chatbots, and demonstrated improved diagnostic capabilities over traditional methods. By reconciling theory and practice, this paper proposes a more robust and actionable standard for chatbot performance evaluation across diverse domains and use cases.},

But in practice, policy investment in capital, talent, technology and infrastructure is not enough. Therefore, it is suggested to comprehensively optimize cross-border data governance by establishing supporting ``resource boxes", using technology ``auxiliary packages" and safeguarding security ``main positions".

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) advances, a variety of methods have been developed to generate text, images, videos, and 3D shapes from single or multimodal inputs, contributing efforts to emulate human-like cognitive content creation. However, generating realistic large-scale scenes from a single input presents a challenge due to the complexities involved in ensuring consistency across extrapolated views generated by models. Benefiting from recent video generation models and implicit neural representations, we propose Scene123, a 3D scene generation model, which combines a video generation framework to ensure realism and diversity with implicit neural fields integrated with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to effectively ensure the consistency of unseen areas across views. Specifically, the input image (or a text-generated image) is first warped to simulate adjacent views, with the invisible regions filled using the consistency-enhanced MAE model. Nonetheless, the synthesized images often exhibit inconsistencies in viewpoint alignment, thus we utilize the produced views to optimize a neural radiance field, enhancing geometric consistency. Moreover, to further enhance the details and texture fidelity of generated views, we employ a GAN-based Loss against images derived from the input image through the video generation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic and consistent scenes from a single prompt. Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Cameras are increasingly augmented with computational processing, producing images that blur the line between documenting reality and creative expression. The rise of text-to-image models has redefined the concept of imagery, sparking ethical and philosophical debates. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study that employed a provocative prototype ‘camera’ – the A(I)Cam – to engage creative practitioners directly in these discussions. Developed using a Research-through-Design (RtD) approach, the tangible prototype generates and instantly prints AI-created images. A(I)Cam facilitated reflection among creative practitioners (N=15) on their experiences with AI-driven tools and the broader implications for their future practices. We examine the shifts in perspective that emerged from engaging with this embodied form of generative AI (genAI), challenging traditional text-based interaction paradigms, and inviting new modes of creative exploration and reflection. In addition, we offer insights from the RtD project, highlighting the integration of genAI tools into the industrial design process.},

abstract = {Building on a foundation of innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, this study presents an evolved approach to assessing student class participation (CP) and providing timely feedback in Masters in Business Administration (MBA) programs. This approach has been rigorously applied and analyzed over the course of four academic terms, thereby offering a substantive examination of its effectiveness. The methodological framework of this study is predicated on the utilization of AI transcription tools, such as GRAIN, to convert Zoom session recordings into analyzable text data. This has enabled a consistent and objective evaluation of each student's contributions during class discussions across four subsequent terms. The implementation involved MBA students who shared similar professional backgrounds and demographics, ensuring a consistent context for analysis. AI-generated insights were integrated with a dynamic dashboard, presenting an innovative way to track and assess CP. These insights underwent meticulous annotation and review to guarantee adherence to the educational standards and fairness expected by the institution. The AI's role as an initial assessor was balanced by the professor's final judgement, forming a complementary relationship that enhanced the educational process. This study's findings are particularly noteworthy in the context of teaching quality and effectiveness. Over the four terms of implementation, student evaluations reflected high satisfaction with respect to fairness and respect in grading, the timeliness of feedback, and the adherence to established grading criteria. Notably, the ratings for these specific criteria consistently exceeded the term mean under the category of "Evaluation." This suggests that the AI-augmented approach not only meets but surpasses traditional evaluation methods, aligning with the broader institutional goals of equitable and efficient educational assessment. In synthesizing the outcomes of this extended application, the paper delineates a clear trajectory of improvement in teaching effectiveness as perceived by the students, attributed to the responsible integration of AI in evaluative practices. These findings provide a compelling argument for the continued and expanded use of AI in the pedagogical process, with the potential to redefine the landscape of assessment in professional education.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been used to organize large datasets into structured, interconnected information, enhancing data analytics across various fields. In the legislative context, one potential natural application of KGs is modeling the intricate set of interconnections that link laws and their articles with each other and the broader legislative context.At the same time, the rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT has opened new opportunities in legal applications, such as text generation and document drafting. Despite their potential, the use of LLMs in legislative contexts is critical since it requires the absence of hallucinations and reliance on up-to-date information, as new laws are published on a daily basis.This work investigates how Legislative Knowledge Graphs and LLMs can synergize and support legislative processes. We address three key questions: the benefits of using KGs for legislative systems, how LLM can support legislative activities by ensuring an accurate output, and how we can allow non-technical users to use such technologies in their activities. To this aim, we develop Legis AI Platform, an interactive platform focused on Italian legislation that enhances the possibility of conducting legislative analysis and that aims to support lawmaking activities.},

abstract = {Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics (PFS). We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.},

We used a design science approach to derive learning archetypes to design a corresponding course curriculum. To evaluate these learning archetypes, we had students work on innovation projects in a course and allowed students to use AI tools without restriction. However, the students were required to clearly state how they utilized the AI tools to produce their results. The results indicate that students who were deeply engaged with AI tools outperformed their peers. However, two groups of students were identified who would require different approaches in a course curriculum to potentially increase their AI literacy. While the first group of students underestimated the abilities of AI tools for their given task, the second group overestimated the results and was too early satisfied with them, lacking a certain amount of curiosity.},

Traditional programming-based approaches can be daunting for students unfamiliar with coding. Initially, software tools like RapidMiner, Weka, and Orange Data Mining were employed to simplify the learning process. However, this method often fell short in conveying deep ML concepts, which often resulted in a superficial understanding. With the advent of user-friendly coding aids like ChatGPT, a transition to Python-based instruction was implemented. Additionally, the incorporation of active learning strategies has further enhanced student engagement and understanding. This shift has shown to improve comprehension and practical skills, evidenced by higher median and maximum grades on the evaluation tool, a final project. A multiple linear regression analysis suggested that performance in “Big Data” significantly predicts grades on the Artificial Intelligence module, and the teaching approach has a marginally significant impact. Subjective analysis by the professor, also proved a better grasp of the concepts by the students.},

abstract = {Community detection is a cornerstone problem in social network analysis (SNA), aimed at identifying cohesive communities with minimal external links. However, the rise of generative AI and Metaverse introduce complexities by creating hybrid human-AI social networks (denoted by HASNs), where traditional methods fall short, especially in human-centric settings. This paper introduces a novel community detection problem in HASNs (denoted by MetaCD), which seeks to enhance human connectivity within communities while reducing the presence of AI nodes. Effective processing of MetaCD poses challenges due to the delicate trade-off between excluding certain AI nodes and maintaining community structure. To address this, we propose CUSA, an innovative framework incorporating AI-aware clustering techniques that navigate this trade-off by selectively retaining AI nodes that contribute to community integrity. Furthermore, given the scarcity of real-world HASNs, we devise four strategies for synthesizing these networks under various hypothetical scenarios. Empirical evaluations on real social networks, reconfigured as HASNs, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach compared to traditional non-deep learning and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods.},

Algorithms with the ability to generate truly convincing images, videos, text and audio capable of fooling any human being. In addition to the possible beneficial uses that this type of technology may have, we must highlight the danger of its misuse for criminal or fraudulent activities. Deepfakes stand out as an example of a potentially dangerous use of these technologies, since they facilitate identity theft and the generation of misinformation. Current solutions are not capable of detecting this type of fake content with sufficient reliability. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new algorithms that solve this problem. This paper presents two methods focusing on the classification and localization of deepfake videos taking into account audio and visual information. These methods were submitted to the ACM 1M Deepfakes Detection Challenge, achieving the highest score in the temporal localization task and a top-five ranking in the classification task.},

This paper proposes hybrid learning through AI-based intelligent recommendation and adaptive learning techniques as a solution. Statistics from the students' learning history and behavioural data are used with deep learning for the prediction of students' learning needs accurate enough to recommend personalised resources. Students' progress in understanding is checked through natural language processing before further personalisation. The complexity of the learning content then changes dynamically in accordance to every individual. The tasks of collecting data, training the proposed model, optimising its algorithm, and validating the experiments therein are undertaken. The experiments find that the performance of student learning using the hybrid model improved by 9.3\%, reduced learning time by 15.5\%, and improved finding the right recommendation by about 23.8\% compared to the non-intelligent platform. In conclusion, the study proves that Ai and open learning, in practice, can increase the efficiency of learning and enhance the learning experience, providing a way to bridge the equity in education with personalised education.},

Finally, this study compares the overall performance of the two models before and after fine-tuning respectively. The results show that the accuracy and performance of the models in the intelligent Q&amp;A task can be significantly improved by incorporating LoRA fine-tuning techniques and cue engineering strategies.

abstract = {Human resource management systems face the rapid development of digital technology and need to continuously innovate to improve work efficiency and decision-making quality. This study mainly focuses on the integrated application of information decision support, designing a MapReduce model to form a traceable information resource system. The information traceability and auxiliary decision-making model created a data mining model, divided into multiple branches, ultimately forming decision trees that can represent different categories. At the same time, the system uses information gain analysis methods to determine the amount of information required to correctly classify randomly selected samples. Simulation results show that this model produces stable evaluation results in employee performance evaluation within human resource management systems, significantly outperforming group decision-making models and multi-attribute decision evaluation models.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies, there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TiP4GEN, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a Dual-branch Generation Model consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.},

Starting with a formative study, we identified eight essential functions necessary for common JM creation. These functions were further refined through a co-design session involving six UX design experts, who were all familiar with GenAI applications, focusing on effectively integrating GenAI to optimize these functions within the JM creation workflow. This collaboration led to the design of the functional prototype of GeneyMAP. This study delineates a replicable process for embedding GenAI in design tools, offering insights into its effective integration into the JM creation process.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and voice user interfaces (VUIs) in hiring processes is a rapidly growing trend. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of companies have adopted automated systems for conducting job interviews. In traditional interview settings, research has shown that gendered interactions between the interviewer and the interviewee can influence performance and hiring decisions. Addressing this issue within the digital job-seeking context, our study investigates whether similar effects occur in interactions with LLM-based voice chatbots during mock job interviews. We conducted a study using two gendered AI interviewer conditions: a feminine AI voice and a masculine AI voice. The study examined how the AI interviewer’s gender presentation influenced interviewees’ lexical diversity, willingness to disclose personal information, and confidence levels. Preliminary findings indicate that gender stereotypes persist in interactions with AI chatbots, with participants associating stereotypical feminine traits with the feminine AI voice. Furthermore, participants reported a more positive overall interview experience with the feminine voice compared to the masculine voice.},

abstract = {In December 2022, Midjourney's public beta test attracted significant attention, especially in 2023, due to its capability to generate comic and illustration styles, highlighting the pivotal role of generative AI images in the future development of technology and art design. Currently, generative AI images are increasingly being utilized as auxiliary tools in fields such as product design, illustration, and sculpture, enhancing the efficiency of design proposals. In design practice education, generative AI images are being integrated into classroom settings, thereby becoming progressively involved in the study of design theory. The use of generative AI images in design education is emerging as a trend in future educational development. As cultural and aesthetic economies evolve, urban and commercial developments are increasingly relying on the integration of art and economics. Public art injects new cultural vitality and exists in various forms, such as art installations. However, there is a lack of research on the use of generative AI images in art installation design education, and teaching methods for art installation design translation are insufficient. This study employs case analysis and interviews based on the continuous interpretive nature of Peirce's Semiotics. The art installation case chosen for this study is "Taichung Hybrid" from the "Touch Taichung" outdoor art installation event. The study explores teaching research in art installation design translation, incorporating generative AI images. A model for AI-assisted art installation design translation is constructed and organized into teaching modes and methods.},

abstract = {With the climate crisis looming, engineering sustainable software systems become crucial to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and foster a greener, more resilient digital ecosystem. For developers, getting access to automated tools that analyze code and suggest sustainability-related optimizations becomes extremely important from a learning and implementation perspective. However, there is currently a dearth of such tools due to the lack of standardized knowledge, which serves as the foundation of these tools. In this paper, we motivate the need for the development of a standard knowledge base of commonly occurring sustainability weaknesses in code, and propose an initial way of doing that. Furthermore, through preliminary experiments, we demonstrate why existing knowledge regarding software weaknesses cannot be re-tagged "as is" to sustainability without significant due diligence, thereby urging further explorations in this ecologically significant domain.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in various domains, including digital forensics. A notable use case of these technologies is automatic code generation, which can reasonably be expected to include digital forensic applications in the not-too-distant future. As with any digital forensic tool, these systems must undergo extensive testing and validation. However, manually evaluating outputs, including generated DF code, remains a challenge. AutoDFBench is an automated framework designed to address this by validating AI-generated code and tools against NIST’s Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT) procedures and subsequently calculating an AutoDFBench benchmarking score. The framework operates in four phases: data preparation, API handling, code execution, and result recording with score calculation. It benchmarks generative AI systems, such as LLMs and automated code generation agents, for DF applications. This benchmark can support iterative development or serve as a comparison metric between GenAI DF systems. As a proof of concept, NIST’s forensic string search tests were used, involving more than 24,200 tests with five top-performing code generation LLMs. These tests validated the output of 121 cases, considering two levels of user expertise, two programming languages, and ten iterations per case with varying prompts. The results also highlight the significant limitations of the DF-specific solutions generated by generic LLMs.},

Knowledge management recognizes the explicit knowledge that workers contribute to an organization, as well as the organizational knowledge and skills acquired over time. The potential impact of generative AI (GenAI) raises many issues and opportunities related to effective knowledge management as organizations explore the impact and implications of its adoption. This research explores issues related to an increasing world of GenAI and proposes a Framework for Knowledge Management in the GenAI Era. Knowledge management workers, who are novices, might be more inclined to use generative AI for performing their tasks. Expert knowledge workers might focus on quality evaluation and quality assessment. Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

Our scoping review indicates that the recent wave of these proposals is motivated by goals such as reducing the costs of research and development work and increasing the diversity of collected data. However, these proposals ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of work with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding.

The research investigates three key aspects: analyzing the visual features and cultural significance of traditional Chinese fonts, exploring the application of AIGC technology in font art design, and proposing an artistic design workflow based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm. The methodology involves: (1) conduct a literature review to study the background of AIGC technology, (2) establishing a project direction, (3) exploring traditional font elements through interdisciplinary collaboration, (4) creating font prototypes, (5) utilizing a locally deployed Stable Diffusion model to generate stylized font designs. (6) Evaluates the practical effects of these designs, highlighting both the advantages and limitations of the design workflow. The results showed that the design methodology workflow largely met the expected outcomes in cultural relevance, diversity, practicality, and creativity. However, the stability rating was lower, primarily due to Stable Diffusion's current limitations in recognizing traditional Chinese elements, leading to instability in generating details of Chinese traditional font elements. This issue was particularly evident in Chinese ink painting styles, brushstroke fonts, and color rendering, highlighting the necessity for further training in these areas.},

abstract = {Gamification is a popular pedagogical approach in computer science education, and advances in large language models (LLMs) enable dynamic and engaging learning experiences, including competition driven by artificial intelligence (AI). This study introduces Quack the Code, a game-show-themed learning tool where students teach an LLM-powered ''debug duck'' while competing in an AI-hosted game. AI was used to generate personalized avatars, usernames, questions, host responses, and interactions with game elements. Offered to undergraduate computer science students (N=25) over a 16-week semester, the game was used repeatedly, mainly near quiz and exam periods. Most of the students (87\%) preferred non-competitive play and focused on Java Basics, the default topic. The students were divided when choosing the type of question, with 45\% requesting the default option of code debugging exercises and 47\% requesting multiple choice questions. The students also changed the difficulty of the question from the default setting (44\%) to the most difficult setting (37\%). Focus groups highlighted positive reactions to competition, AI interactivity, and customization, but noted challenges with unclear instructions and user interfaces. The results suggest that LLM-powered gamification can enhance engagement and learning, with future improvements focused on usability and curriculum integration to increase participation and impact.},

Study 1 employed a Be-task to deplete cognitive resources, revealing that user involvement in writing enhances perceived identity reflection, which leads to greater persistence in unsolvable tasks and higher credibility and behavioral trust in AI. Study 2, using an email-writing task with greater ecological validity, showed the effect of user involvement on credibility. Practically, these findings suggest that AI interfaces should balance cognitive assistance with fostering user agency.

abstract = {In the evolving landscape of cultural heritage preservation, emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are reshaping how archival and heritage material are preserved, documented, interpreted and promoted, since they can allow interactive and immersive experiences that can lead to deeper engagement and cultural appreciation. Traditional clothing that was worn during folk dancing is a core element of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage since it is correlated with various parameters such as movement, shapes, materials, crafts and history. This study aims to explore the possible ways that emerging technologies can contribute to the preservation and promotion of traditional costumes by studying current state of the art in the digitization and interactive presentation of traditional costumes, with particular emphasis on movement and interactivity aspects. Furthermore, it examines case studies of AI application in the traditional heritage clothing area as well as in the contemporary fashion retail sector. The goal is to identify gaps in the existing XR heritage costumes pipeline and investigate areas that AI can contribute and ultimately, taking paradigms from AI applications in retail industry to see possible applications in the promotion/preservation of costume heritage section. Through the analysis of representative studies and projects, the review highlights growing interest in areas such as immersive experiences and 3D garment reconstruction. However, significant gaps persist in the dynamic, motion-aware, and interactive representation of costumes, especially within dance contexts. The study examines how AI can support various stages of the digital costume heritage pipeline, including metadata enrichment, generative reconstruction, motion simulation, and user experience evaluation. Moreover it identifies the domains where AI technologies are currently more mature and those where development is still emerging. Finally, it outlines future research opportunities, particularly in AI-assisted animation, virtual try-on systems, and gamified cultural applications. This review calls for a shift from passive digitization to context-aware, interactive, and embodied approaches that can capture the full material and symbolic complexity of traditional garments as both cultural artifacts and living expressions of heritage.},

abstract = {The digital transformation of higher education is occurring rapidly around the globe, leaving an indelible mark on improving the quality of education, expanding the accessibility of educational resources, and realizing innovation and reform in teaching and research. The extant research on digital transformation in higher education is relatively limited in scope and has certain inherent limitations. Therefore, this paper employs the method of systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the digital transformation of higher education from three perspectives: digital technology, existing challenges, and future trends. This analysis aims to identify potential correlations between these three dimensions and offer valuable insights for those engaged in the education industry and researchers. Furthermore, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of digital transformation and to provide guidance for future research directions.},

Knowledge management recognizes the explicit knowledge that workers contribute to an organization, as well as the organizational knowledge and skills acquired over time. The potential impact of generative AI (GenAI) raises many issues and opportunities related to effective knowledge management as organizations explore the impact and implications of its adoption. This research explores issues related to an increasing world of GenAI and proposes a Framework for Knowledge Management in the GenAI Era. Knowledge management workers, who are novices, might be more inclined to use generative AI for performing their tasks. Expert knowledge workers might focus on quality evaluation and quality assessment. Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of science and technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education begin to increase. Many well-known universities in China have stepped up their pace and actively explored the deep integration of "artificial intelligence + education". A series of innovative practices, such as intelligent teaching system, intelligent classroom, virtual teaching assistant and personalized learning platform, all show that the education industry is undergoing an unprecedented intelligent transformation. But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

abstract = {Gamification is a popular pedagogical approach in computer science education, and advances in large language models (LLMs) enable dynamic and engaging learning experiences, including competition driven by artificial intelligence (AI). This study introduces Quack the Code, a game-show-themed learning tool where students teach an LLM-powered ''debug duck'' while competing in an AI-hosted game. AI was used to generate personalized avatars, usernames, questions, host responses, and interactions with game elements. Offered to undergraduate computer science students (N=25) over a 16-week semester, the game was used repeatedly, mainly near quiz and exam periods. Most of the students (87\%) preferred non-competitive play and focused on Java Basics, the default topic. The students were divided when choosing the type of question, with 45\% requesting the default option of code debugging exercises and 47\% requesting multiple choice questions. The students also changed the difficulty of the question from the default setting (44\%) to the most difficult setting (37\%). Focus groups highlighted positive reactions to competition, AI interactivity, and customization, but noted challenges with unclear instructions and user interfaces. The results suggest that LLM-powered gamification can enhance engagement and learning, with future improvements focused on usability and curriculum integration to increase participation and impact.},

We discuss innovative supports such as skill-specific student clubs, experiential learning, and enhanced career services that go beyond traditional approaches, including strategies for effective job placement. Additionally, this paper addresses the unique challenges faced by international students, such as visa restrictions and cultural adaptation, suggesting that university-led advocacy and proactive employment assistance can improve outcomes. By integrating rigorous academic training with real-world application and targeted job search support, small universities can evolve into attractive hubs for global education, fostering financial stability and strengthening their international presence. This dual approach ensures that international graduates are not only educated but also well-prepared to navigate the competitive job market.},

However, running these LLMs traditionally requires access to advanced hardware resources and technical knowledge. To better provide a platform for experimenting with LLMs for users of all skill levels, we developed the Tufts Technology Services (TTS) LLM-Hub, a series of example Jupyter notebooks served through Tufts Open OnDemand (OOD) to setup, configure, and run LLMs automatically. The TTS LLM-Hub enabled quick access to running LLMs, while reducing barriers to compute and enabling users to chat with an LLM in just four clicks. We have used these platforms for support of advanced data science courses, and to enable research computing at Tufts.},

However, analytical methods to study the impact of this approach are not readily available for high performance computing use cases. In this position paper, we propose isoefficiency as an approach to analytically demonstrate the classes of algorithms that would benefit from disaggregated memory technologies as we scale to a larger number of processors. Isoefficiency of an algorithm is given by a function N(p) that measures the degree to which the problem size needs to increase with p (number of processors) to maintain a constant efficiency. We evaluate isoefficiency using sparse general matrix–matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) on a 2-socket shared-memory system and the simulation of a CXL-based disaggregated system. Our results support the suitability of isoefficiency for evaluating disaggregated memory systems with different design choices in conjunction with different application kernels.},

Even for those automatically generated using artificial intelligence (AI), it is not well understood whether or how they affect learning outcomes, user experience, and trust. To address this gap, we developed ReelsEd, which is a web-based system that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate structured short-form video (i.e., reels) from lecture long-form videos while preserving instructor-authored material. In a between-subject user study with 62 university students, we evaluated ReelsEd and demonstrated that it outperformed traditional long-form videos in engagement, quiz performance, and task efficiency without increasing cognitive load. Learners expressed high trust in our system and valued its clarity, usefulness, and ease of navigation. Our findings point to new design opportunities for integrating generative AI into educational tools that prioritize usability, learner agency, and pedagogical alignment.},

abstract = {Artists have been raising the alarm about unfair and opaque practices of generative AI models for nearly two years. In a technological attempt to answer these concerns, concept erasing has promised to give artists more agency in determining whether new generative AI models get to clone their signature artistic styles. The idea behind this method is simple: take an already trained AI model, choose an artist’s style to remove from the model, and apply minimal changes to suppress that concept. Simple integration into existing pipelines makes it a particularly appealing solution. However, the efficacy of this method has so far been examined for only one artist’s style at a time. This paper, thus, examines concept erasing at scale, simulating the hypothetical application of this technology for simultaneously erasing many artists. It finds that the method does not reliably erase the concepts in cases with more than one artist’s style, highlighting a gap in the technology and the literature around it.},

As a result, information technology teachers are confronted with the challenge of restructuring their subject knowledge and developing intelligent literacy. In the context of applying AI to basic education, intelligent literacy has become an essential professional skill for IT teachers. This paper proposes a framework for cultivating intelligent literacy among information technology teachers based on Artificial Intelligence Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (AI-TPACK) theory. The study aims to elucidate the meaning of AI-TPACK for information technology teachers, establish AI-TPACK models and practice paths for them, propose strategies for integrating subject teaching knowledge with artificial intelligence technology, and enhance cultivation and development plans for their intelligent literacy. The goal is to enhance the teaching abilities of information technology teachers so that they can acquire comprehensive artificial intelligence literacy in their work and better adapt to the new requirements and challenges presented by the era of AI.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) has fueled research exploring applications across diverse age groups and domains. However, its potential to support individuals in retirement transitions remains underexplored. This study aims to uncover the potential of GenAI in this context by examining its current and anticipated roles through semi-structured interviews with 10 middle-aged individuals navigating retirement transitions. The findings highlight three key roles of GenAI as an identity navigator, self-actualization facilitator, and connection catalyst. Building on the findings, the study identifies novel design opportunities for GenAI-based systems that assist an integrated journey from self-discovery to self-actualization, and support both direct and indirect connection to the world. The research aims to inspire the HCI community to further investigate these new design possibilities and attract attention to the unique context of retirement transition.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of deepfake techniques presents dual challenges for detection models: adapting to continuously shifting attack distributions while retaining previously learned knowledge. Although recent continual deepfake detection methods have made progress, they often rely on replay-based training, which limits scalability and deployment. Meanwhile, the task structure of deepfake detection offers a unique opportunity that remains under-explored: it is inherently a binary classification problem with a fixed label space, where the main difficulty lies in distributional drift rather than class expansion. This insight enables the modeling of each incremental distribution shift as a dedicated expert, focusing on specific forgery patterns. To this end, we propose a novel analytically driven, replay-free continual detection framework that eliminates the need for iterative gradient updates. In this framework, task-specific experts are constructed via closed-form ridge regression, requiring only a single forward pass and ensuring non-interference with previous tasks. To enhance the model's capacity for fine-grained forgery recognition, we introduce a lightweight Forgery-Aware Residual Enhancer (FARE). At inference, an Uncertainty-Guided Expert Selection module (UGES) dynamically routes each sample to the most confident expert, which does not require prior knowledge of the attack type. The proposed framework achieves a favorable trade-off between efficiency, privacy, and generalization. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets, with an average accuracy of 91.82\% and only 1.78\% forgetting. Notably, it improves cross-forgery generalization by 9.28\% on unseen forgery types, demonstrating strong generalization.},

abstract = {Storyboarding is an established method for designing user experiences. Generative AI can support this process by helping designers quickly create visual narratives. However, existing tools mainly focus on improving the accuracy of text-to-image generation. There is a lack of understanding on how to effectively support the entire creative process of storyboarding and how to develop AI-powered tools to be integrated into designers’ diverse workflows. In this work, we designed and developed StoryDiffusion, a system that integrates text-to-text and text-to-image models, to support the generation of narratives and images in a single pipeline. In a user study, we observed 12 UX design students using the system for both concept ideation and illustration tasks. Our findings identified AI-directed vs. user-directed creative strategies in both tasks and revealed the importance of supporting the interchange between narrative iteration and image generation. We also found effects of the design tasks on their strategies and preferences, providing insights for future development.},

abstract = {The fast evolution of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is remaking higher education, especially in design disciplines where creativity and technology come together. This study looks into the main factors that affect how design educators take up AIGC tools and puts forward an evaluation framework for AIGC-assisted teaching platforms. Using a four-dimensional model which includes technical functionality, teaching support, role adaptability, and ethical risk perception, this research makes use of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to figure out the priorities of the faculty. Data from surveys and experts in four universities shows that the effectiveness of teaching support has the highest weight (0.3000). After that comes the satisfaction with technical functionality (0.2667), then role adaptability (0.2333), and finally risk and ethical perception (0.2000). At the sub-criterion level, things like making teaching efficiency better, enhancing content generation, and optimizing instructional design have come up as really important needs. The study gives some practical suggestions, such as making the integration of AIGC content better, allowing for teacher-AI co-creation workflows, and strengthening the transparency of the platform and its ethical safeguards. These findings offer both theoretical understanding and practical help for building AIGC teaching systems that are effective and can be trusted, and that support the collaboration between humans and AI in creative education. This study also comes up with a cloud model algorithm to evaluate China's mainstream AIGC platform, Deepseek. This way is used to check if the evaluation system proposed in this study is scientific and strict.},

Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

abstract = {The global ultra-wide display market is growing rapidly due to widespread consumer adoption. However, existing content, especially on TV screens, is mainly designed for lower aspect ratios like 4:3. As TVs shift towards wider formats, there’s a need to develop a method to transform legacy content and adapt to varying screen sizes. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize the content viewing experience for gamers, content creators, and streaming enthusiasts. While delivering high-quality visual content for dynamic aspect ratios remains a challenge, recent advancements in Deep Learning show promise in addressing these problems with generative approaches. Our contribution begins with a survey of prior video completion efforts, providing a foundational backdrop. We then introduce our novel solution, combining optical flow methodologies with generative latent diffusion models. These models, conditioned on an initial prompt and evolving video frame, refine content generation. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness. In summary, our study pioneers advancements in content generation for ultra-wide displays.},

However, prior research shows that ethical issues are better taught in tandem with their related technical content as an integral required skill in CS curricula. In this experience report, we share our experience with embedding ethics assignments in 3 CS courses at different levels: a CS2 course in software design and data structures, a CS3 course in data structures and algorithms, and a Software Engineering capstone course, all taught at Virginia Tech (a large public R1 institution) in Spring 2024. Students from the 3 courses were surveyed at the beginning and end of Spring 2024. By comparing results from the pre and post surveys, we found that the embedded assignments for the CS2 and CS3 courses improved students' confidence in their knowledge about how ethical issues may come into play in their career, their confidence in their ability to address ethical issues arising from applying technology in real contexts, and their confidence in communicating and defending their positions on how to address these issues. For all 3 courses, students gave positive feedback on how the assignments were engaging and relevant to the course, and how it improved their ability in raising, and reasoning about, ethical implications of technology. We believe that the practices and results of our experience will be helpful to other CS instructors thinking of injecting ethical content into their technical courses.},

Financially-constrained aspiring entrepreneurs, many of whom are racial minorities, must overcome many challenges to achieve their goals.

In my dissertation, I examine how existing sociotechnical interventions, including social media and community-based-organization (CBO)-supported interventions, can support their entrepreneurial transitions, especially as a provision of informational and emotional support. Early findings from my dissertation research suggest that CBO-supported peer group interventions provide a source of informational and emotional support, helping financially-constrained aspiring entrepreneurs make progress toward their goals and overcome setbacks. In my dissertation, I aim to unpack the factors that contribute to the success of such groups and contribute design opportunities for sociotechnical interventions to better support financially-constrained aspiring entrepreneurs’ work-role transition processes.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

The cause explains the “why,” whereas the effect describes the “what.” The domain itself encompasses a plethora of disciplines from statistics and computer science to economics and philosophy. Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have nourished a renewed interest in identifying and estimating the cause-and-effect relationship from the substantial amount of available observational data. This has resulted in various new studies aimed at providing novel methods for identifying and estimating causal inference. We include a detailed taxonomy of causal inference frameworks, methods, and evaluation. An overview of causality for security is also provided. Open challenges are detailed, and approaches for evaluating the robustness of causal inference methods are described. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on such studies of causality. We provide an in-depth review of causality frameworks and describe the different methods.},

The rise of computer-based instruction offered partial solutions, tailoring student progression and automating some facets of the mastery learning process. This work in progress considers the application of large language models for content generation tailored to mastery learning. We present a paired framework for analyzing and evaluating the generated content relative to rubrics designed by the teacher. Recognizing the potential of large language models, we critically assess the potential of improving mastery-based instruction.

abstract = {Behaviour change, crucial in health interventions, demands an understanding of the end user’s psychological, social, and environmental contexts, often overlooked in user modelling. This paper advocates integrating behaviour change theories into user models to improve personalisation based on individual characteristics. We introduce a novel, enriched with psychological theories, framework for using dynamic user Personas within Digital Behaviour Change Interventions, allowing adaptation to evolving user behaviours and preferences. The dynamic user Personas offer a detailed representation that accounts for the complex stages of behavioural change and COM-B patterns. We also explore the transition in user modelling from expert-driven to data-driven methods, highlighting the importance of acknowledging both interpersonal and intrapersonal variations in user behaviours. Our proposed semi-automated system model merges these modelling methods, enhancing personalisation in health interventions by addressing human behavioural complexities. Additionally, we discuss the ethical and privacy issues involved, ensuring responsible and secure data management. In conclusion, our approach conceptually links behaviour change, interaction design, and user modelling, setting a foundation for further empirical research and digital health applications.},

abstract = {Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Document layout understanding is a field of study that analyzes the spatial arrangement of information in a document hoping to understand its structure and layout. Models such as LayoutLM (and its subsequent iterations) can understand semi-structured documents with SotA results; however, the lack of open semi-structured data is a limitation in itself. While semi-structured data is common in everyday life (balance sheets, purchase orders, receipts), there is a lack of public datasets for training machine learning models for this type of document. In this investigation we propose a method to generate new, synthetic, layout information that can help overcoming this data shortage. According to our results, the proposed method performs better than LayoutTransformer, another popular layout generation method. We also show that, in some scenarios, text classification can improve when supported by bounding box information.},

abstract = {We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid - a decentralised Web specification - to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address.

This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

Most interventions to counter misinformation on social media are text-based, which may lack the persuasive power of richer modalities. This study explores whether the effectiveness of misinformation correction varies by modality, and if certain modalities of misinformation are better countered by a specific correction modality. We conducted a survey-based experiment where participants rated the credibility of misinformation tweets before and after exposure to corrections, across all combinations of text, images and video modalities. Our findings suggest that corrections are most effective when their modality richness matches that of the original misinformation. We discuss factors affecting the perceived credibility of corrections and offer strategies to optimise misinformation correction.},

abstract = {Voice User Interfaces (VUI) are particularly useful if the operator has to work hands-free or if her cognitive load is very high. This is the case, e.g., when the operator can be easily disturbed by the environment, the operational task induces stress and there is little or no fault tolerance. However, the factors that contribute to the usefulness of a VUI also complicate the design. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) must be robust in noisy environments, under non-optimal microphone conditions and for different types of speech – including stress-induced shouting, hyper articulation and heavy breathing, among others. Commercially available, generic ASR solutions do not fulfil high robustness requirements under these conditions. However, ASR systems can be made robust if they are tailored to their respective use cases and personalised for specific users. This paper introduces a method to customize a Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognizer (LVCSR) system to achieve such robustness. An LVCSR system includes a language model (LM) and an acoustic model (AM). The customization involves adapting both the LM and the AM to the specific operational context. For LM customization, we employ an Use Case Editor (UCE) that provides an intuitive interface, enabling users to align linguistic models with their unique needs. For AM customization, a Multi Speaker Text to Speech Synthesis (MSTTS) module is used to automatically generate personalized speech data, ensuring the model captures the distinctive characteristics of individual speakers. Together, these adaptations ensure the LVCSR system is configured to meet the demands of challenging environments and diverse users.},

We analyze the differences across 8 open-source LLMs when processing prompts of different task categories. Our findings lead to a novel approach: Classifying prompts by using embeddings to route them to the most energy-efficient and least carbon-intensive LLM in a federation of LLMs while keeping accuracy high.

This study puts forth a conceptual framework (APEC - Adaptive Programming Education via ChatGPT) that integrates both bottom-up and top-down approaches, incorporating ChatGPT as the principal instructor for the study of programming. An empirical study was undertaken to assess the usefulness of ChatGPT as a tool for teaching novice programmers a new programming language. This empirical study was conducted on 20 undergraduate students. To provide an expert assessment of the quality of the responses, a survey was conducted with three programming experts proficient in Python. The survey findings indicate that ChatGPT is proficient in explaining core principles such as variables, data types, and control statements through conversational exchanges, adopting an intelligent and logical methodology.

We initiated the study by considering the traditional AT-making processes performed by OTs and prototyped a web interface that incorporates generative AI to support these processes. Through a series of user studies, we collected OTs' preliminary insights on how generative AI could bridge the gap between clinical reasoning and technical design, potentially streamlining the AT creation and adaptation process while maintaining the crucial element of personalized AT solutions. The study's findings highlight several key benefits of generative AI in OT practice: 1) customization of AT solutions tailored to individual client needs, 2) improved visualization capabilities for client communication, 3) inspiration for new AT design ideas, and 4) potential for rapid prototyping and practice. However, key drawbacks were noted, including limitations in inputting measurements, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and necessitate substantial modifications to the created AT, along with challenges associated with the current state of generative AI.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to evaluate and compare the functions and characteristics of different artificial intelligence generative tools in the field of industrial equipment modeling design through experiments, and to select easy-to-use AIGC auxiliary design tools. First, through the AI background survey of the designer group, four AI tools that participated in the analysis of pros and cons were identified, and combined with their generation methods (Text-generated pictures and image-generated pictures), the control variable method was used to conduct comparative experiments. In the same case, the ease of learning of four AI design tools and the user experience, controllability, stability and other factors in the two generation methods were compared, and the generation effect was evaluated through user satisfaction scores. Through comparative experiments, the Stable Diffusion tool based on artificial intelligence generation technology shows its advantages in the field of industrial equipment modeling design. Its generation effect satisfaction and controllability scores are higher than other AIGC tools, and industrial equipment is generated through AI tools. The speed of styling is thousands of times that of ordinary designers. It can be concluded that Stable Diffusion, an auxiliary design tool based on AIGC technology, can be used as a new tool for industrial equipment design. It can quickly and efficiently assist the generation of design plans, improve design efficiency to a certain extent, shorten the design cycle, and provide industrial equipment Styling design provides a new way of thinking and methods.},

High-quality personas are based on robust user data; otherwise, they may cause more problems than they solve. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, shows potential in enhancing persona development by integrating diverse user data sources. However, its reliability is questionable due to its lack of human contextual understanding and real-life experience. This paper introduces the concept of vector personas, a method that combines AI with traditional qualitative techniques to develop user personas. Our UX team tested our approach by comparing personas created through traditional methods with those personas generated using AI. We employed a structured comparison and triangulated data from user feedback. Our study highlights the benefits and limitations of using AI in persona development. Although AI can enhance efficiency and offer new insights, it cannot replace the depth of understanding provided by real-life user-driven research. The vector persona process optimizes persona development by balancing time investment and information quality through integrating AI outputs with human insights to create comprehensive and accurate user representations.},

Pre-trained models have changed the AI innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with pre-trained models.},

abstract = {Story visualization aims to create visual content, such as images and videos, that is consistent, coherent, and complete with a given story. Despite significant advances in the application of diffusion models for general text-to-image generation tasks, they still encounter difficulties when directly used to produce consistent visual content that accurately aligns with the narrative text. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free automated story visualization framework called AgentStory that can generate image illustrations based on a story synopsis provided by users. Specifically, the framework employs multiple agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to create detailed descriptions of each subject and scene in the entire story. Then, it integrates a masking mechanism with a fine-grained consistency refinement adapter to incorporate different subjects in a scene. Furthermore, it utilizes the visual understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs to include detailed features of different subjects in the refinement adapter, thus improving the consistency of each subject across multiple scenes. Finally, we compare the AgentStory framework with state-of-the-art baselines for story visualization on the DS-500 dataset and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of subject consistency, text-image alignment, and aesthetic quality.

We showcase how to transform an undocumented, technical, low-level TikZ into a user-friendly, configurable, Web-based customization tool written in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and itself configurable. We discuss how generative AI can support this transformation process and traditional variability engineering tasks, such as identification and implementation of features, synthesis of a template code generator, and development of end-user configurators. We believe it is a first step towards democratizing variability programming, opening a path for end-users to adapt code to their needs.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology and advances in smart technologies, the modes of reading have become more diversified. It is now possible not only to read books with one's eyes but also to "listen" to them, offering the better reading experience. University students need to constantly absorb information and knowledge from the outside world, which means that they need an efficient and easy way to read and learn, and the use of intelligent audio reading platform can fulfill this need. Therefore, in order to propose strategies to promote university students' use of intelligent audio reading platforms for reading and learning, this study employs a questionnaire survey to investigate the factors influencing university students' behavioral intention to use audio reading platform for reading and learning. A sample of 236 university students was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). Results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social influence have a significant positive influence on the behavioral intention of university students to use audio reading platform for reading and learning, while perceived cost and perceived enjoyment have no significant influence on the behavioral intention. Based on these results, this study proposes strategies for university teachers, intelligent audio reading platform developers and operators to promote university students’ use of intelligent audio reading platform for reading and learning. For university teachers, they can promote the adoption of audio reading by guiding students to use audio reading platforms for learning. For developers of an intelligent audio reading platform, based on generative AI, they can enhance reading and learning experience for university students by optimizing personalized recommendation functions and offering diverse reading preferences, such as pronunciation styles and speeds. For operators of intelligent audio reading platforms, they can ensure high-quality content, stable network connections, and reasonable pricing strategies to enhance university students’ reading and learning experience.},

As a community, we must commit to educating about accessibility and elevating the voices and experiences of people with disabilities, to ensure their needs are prioritised and addressed. This commitment will bridge the existing gap and foster a more inclusive approach to GenAI. Otherwise, the cycle of exclusion will persist.},

abstract = {Graph databases are used across several domains due to the intuitive structure of graphs. They are well-suited for storing document collections together with their interlinkages through metadata and annotations. Yet, querying such graphs requires database experts' involvement for query formulation, reducing accessibility to nonexperts. To address this issue, we present Graph Detective, a web interface that provides an intuitive entry point for graph data exploration, where users can create queries visually with little effort, eliminating the need for expertise in query writing. After processing, the resulting query output (a graph) is then rendered in an interactive 3D visualization. This visualization allows the analysis of structural traits of the resulting graph data, exploiting the documents and metadata interlinkage. Our user evaluation revealed that even individuals inexperienced with graph databases or graph data, in general, could satisfactorily access the graph data through our interface. Furthermore, experienced participants commented that our interface was more efficient than writing explicit queries in graph database query language. Interested users can find the code openly accessible on GitHub1.},

abstract = {The contradiction between users' music consumption and the abundance of music data has spurred the emergence of music recommendation systems. These systems merge recommendation systems with music suggestions, serving as a widely utilized solution in real-world scenarios and presenting a multifaceted challenge. Many methods of recommendation systems need to combine the characteristics of music recommendation itself. For example, with the rise of mobile Internet and the popularity of smartphones, the places where users listen to music are not limited by time or space; the emotions of users when listening to music also have a great influence on music recommendations, so it is necessary to study personalized music recommendation systems. In this review, we mainly focus on deep learning-based music recommendation systems, starting from the perspectives of neural network structure and personalized recommendation systems, discussing the principles, characteristics, and applications of different models. We also review the main methods and latest research results used in music recommendation systems. This review should be of great help to scholars who are new to the field of music recommendation or want to quickly grasp the recent advances in the field.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {This article discusses the evolution of trial management in China——from early practices that combined judicial and administrative functions to the new stage of digital and intelligent supervision. At the beginning, the reforms focused on standardizing procedures and promoting the separation between adjudication and management. This helped reduce administrative interference in judicial work and improved both the independence of judges and the efficiency. Also, The establishment of specialized departments, such as trial management offices, has provided organization guarantees for this goal. However, as administrative control increased, it also led to some problems such as the lengthy process and the program idling. In response, recent reforms have turned to use smart court technologies to reconstruct management model. Guided by computational jurisprudence theory, courts in multiple regions have begun utilizing artificial intelligence and big data tools to supervise and assist throughout the entire litigation process. Through technological applications such as automated case handling, real-time procedural monitoring, and standardized processing of similar cases, these innovations streamline management hierarchies while enhancing the quality and efficiency of adjudication. Looking ahead, reforms need to especially pay attention to the collaborative innovation between different subjects, transparency of algorithmic systems, and improve the risk prevention and control mechanism, all of which will help giving important supply to building a more intelligent and reliable judicial system based on the principles of digital justice.},

These skills are particularly important for learners to develop in the age of generative AI where AI tools can demonstrate complex knowledge and ability previously thought to be uniquely human. To activate effective human-AI partnerships in writing, this paper provides a first step toward conceptualizing the notion of critical learner interaction with AI. Using both theoretical models and empirical data, our preliminary findings suggest a general lack of Deep interaction with AI during the writing process.

abstract = {As data corpus-driven tools and technologies increasingly push users to passively search for an answer, rather than search to understand, we believe that technical and computing disciplinary writing courses have a duty to teach the process of responsible data storytelling. While students can grasp that generative AI makes mistakes, hallucinates, and perpetuates bias, they can need help understanding the antecedent causes of those difficulties. All algorithmically driven decision-making or recommending software have in common a large data set that has been labeled, either by users or by the system itself. The origins of that data and the reasonable applications/deductions and conclusions possible for any given dataset have everything to do with why some tools help and some tools perpetuate harms. By starting at the very beginning and asking students to make sense of data, students can more easily see how purpose and audience impact analysis of any given collection of data. Once those opportunities for rhetorical choice making are known, students become ready to understand the connection between data and complex A.I. systems and some of the ways that bias and other kinds of harm can result if designers are not careful. Combining instruction in a technical coding environment with basic data literacy lessons such as ‘the seven data stories,’ [14] we developed and delivered a three-week writing unit designed around responsible data exploration and storytelling. In this experience report, we provide the assignment we used, and the scaffolded activities we employed to bring students through the process, remarking on what worked well and what we want to improve. We provide attendees with a link to an R-based notebook with a walk-through lesson on data exploration commands, and the rubric used to assess students’ texts, notebooks with code and commentary and results, all existing in a referential context. We provide the survey results of students’ perception of learning from this activity. Early findings demonstrate that students internalized lessons about the non-objective nature of data analysis and of specific responsible data storytelling practices required by anyone seeking to ethically represent answers within and limitations of any dataset.},

An approach of guided experimentation, including an intervention with a serious game, allowed civil servants to experiment, to understand the technology and its associated risks. The case study demonstrates that this approach enhances the awareness of possibilities and limitations, and the ethical considerations, of genAI usage.

Traditional GIS processing methods cannot provide decision-making analysis and prediction functions from the massive historical data of risk accidents. Establishing a water supply network data warehouse and conducting spatial data mining on its basis can solve this problem. This article establishes a spatial data warehouse based on DBMS business data and GIS data in a spatial database, and conducts research and practice on various spatial mining algorithms for the explosive tube fact table. The experiment evaluated various impact characteristics of pipe burst analysis and established a risk prediction model for pipe burst analysis to quantitatively evaluate the risk rate of the pipeline network. This solution not only provides decision-making basis for pre accident prevention and management of water supply enterprises, but also monitors, analyzes, and predicts the risks of the pipeline network.},

Current nightmare therapy has set high requirements for therapists, appeared abstract to clients, and showed poor interaction between them, due to its extensive information input, lack of sensory stimulation, and exclusive reliance on one-on-one conversation. We propose DreamDirector, a visual-interactive and narrative generative system powered by generative AI. Based on Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) and Nightmare Deconstruction and Reprocessing (NDR), the system can (1) recollect the nightmare scene, (2) interpret the dream with LLM, (3) reprocess the nightmare by generating therapeutic dream visuals using AI painting alongside meditative texts, and feedback with a picture book. Finally, we verified the usability of this system in terms of efficiency enhancement and interaction promotion through a user study with 2 therapists and 16 clients. The results revealed emotional relief among clients, with a positive and impressive attitude toward visual interaction.},

abstract = {Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is a crucial component of broadscale video retrieval systems. Its goal is to accurately identify various quality issues in videos, thereby encouraging the video retrieval system to prioritize high-quality videos. In large-scale industrial video retrieval systems, we formulate the characteristics of low-quality videos into four categories: visual-related low-level quality problems such as mosaics and black boxes, textual-related low-level quality problems caused by video title and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) content, as well as semantic-level frame incoherence and frame-text mismatch caused by emerging AI-generated videos. These kinds of low-quality videos, which are widely present in industrial environments, have been overlooked in academic research before, and accurately identifying them is very challenging. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Branch Collaborative learning Network (MBCN) to tackle the above issues. We carefully design four assessment branches for MBCN to adapt to the above four kinds of issues for industrial video retrieval systems. After obtaining independent scores for each branch, we perform a weighted aggregation of the various branches to dynamically address video quality issues in different scenarios with a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism. Finally, we integrate point-wise and pair-wise optimization objectives to ensure the predicted scores are stable and fall into a reasonable range. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MBCN, we conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a world-level video search engine. The experimental results show that due to the powerful ability of MBCN to identify video quality issues, the ranking ability of the video retrieval system has been significantly improved. We also conduct a series of detailed experimental analyses to verify that all four evaluation branches play a positive role. Besides that, for emerging low-quality AI-generated videos, the recognition accuracy of MBCN also improves significantly compared to the baseline.},

High-quality personas are based on robust user data; otherwise, they may cause more problems than they solve. Generative AI like ChatGPT shows potential in enhancing persona development by integrating diverse user data sources. However, its reliability is questionable due to its lack of contextual understanding and real-world experience. This paper introduces the concept of "Vector Personas," a method combining AI and traditional qualitative techniques to develop personas. Our UX team tested this approach by comparing personas created through traditional methods with those generated with AI assistance, using a structured comparison and triangulation of data from user feedback. Our study highlights the benefits and limitations of using AI in persona development. While AI can enhance efficiency and offer new insights, it cannot replace the depth of understanding provided by human research. The Vector Persona process optimizes persona development by balancing time investment and information quality, integrating AI outputs with human insights to create comprehensive and accurate user representations.},

abstract = {Computational approaches are central to deriving insights in modern science. In this interdisciplinary convergence, researchers are increasingly expected to share research code and data along with published results. However, with software engineering practices still predominantly an overlooked component in research, it remains unclear whether sharing data and code alone is sufficient for reproducibility in practice. We set out to reproduce and replicate evaluation results of a publicly available human neuroimaging dataset recorded when participants listened to short stories. Using the code and data shared with the paper, we predicted the brain activity of the participants with semantic embeddings of words in stories. We successfully reproduced the original results, showing that model performance improved with more training data. However, when we replicated the analysis with our own code, the model’s performance was much lower than reported in the paper. We traced this difference to the discrepancy between method description and its implementation in shared code. While access to original code proved crucial for our ability to replicate the results, barriers such as a complex code structure and insufficient documentation hindered our progress. We argue that software engineering practices are essential for reproducible and reusable research. We discuss components of our workflow and specific practices that effectively mitigate barriers to reproducibility.},

abstract = {Critical thinking and creativity are fundamental skills for engineers and computer scientists. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) able to create chatbots that use natural language is an opportunity for educators to foster these skills. The well-known risk of generative AI for potential misinformation offers fertile ground to practice critical thinking.This paper describes a hands-on experience within a database course, where students had to develop a chatbot using the LangChain framework, and to evaluate it from different points of view. The students were free to choose the domain of their chatbot. The learning goal was twofold: on the one hand, to make them practice with state-of-the-art technologies, and on the other hand to stimulate critical analysis on their output. The paper discusses the students' evaluation of the chatbots under several metrics, including document retrieval, syntax and grammar accuracy, semantic relevance and information reliability. Students' assessments were also compared to the teachers' ones, to gain an insight on the critical attitude of the students and to offer a ground for discussion.The experience was stimulating and appreciated by the students. The final results highlight that the majority of students successfully produced chatbot responses that were grammatically and syntactically correct, and that consistently extracted pertinent sections from documents, yielding semantically relevant outputs. Despite these achievements, a significant portion of students expressed reservations about the reliability of the chatbot's responses to prompts, gaining awareness of LLMs' capability to generate responses that make sense to humans but may be potentially misleading.},

abstract = {With the ever-improving computation capability of GPUs, there is an increasing demand for higher memory bandwidth to supply the GPU cores with data. One way to improve effective memory bandwidth is with larger caches, and we have seen GPU vendors recently invest in very large last-level caches (LLCs). The key challenge is to maximize cache utilization and keep the active working set on-chip during the lifetime of a kernel. Software tiling optimizations can help, but programmers alone cannot anticipate dynamic cache capacity contention. To this end, we introduce the concept of cache cohorts: groups of kernels that share the same working set and thus can be efficiently scheduled together. Our approach uses the GPU command processor (CP) to track the occupancy of the LLC and throttles scheduling of the next cohort if there is no room. To evaluate the design space, we modify the existing GPU firmware on the AMD RX 7600 and RX 7900 XTX GPUs to prototype the scheduling scheme using real hardware. Our preliminary results show up to 27\% reduction in execution time using the cache optimized scheduling technique on RX 7900 XTX.},

abstract = {Opinion polarization, a phenomenon characterized by the widening divide between individuals or groups holding contrasting viewpoints, has emerged as a salient feature of contemporary societal discourse, particularly in social media. Opinion polarization poses challenges to decision-making processes, hindering consensus-building efforts vital for addressing pressing different issues such as climate change and socioeconomic inequality. Thus, it is essential to develop new methods and tools for analyzing and addressing the dynamics of opinion polarization. In the last years, visualization techniques have evolved to provide valuable insight when modeling knowledge, and their integration with artificial intelligence techniques has strengthened different possibilities, paving the way for visual analytics and visual knowledge discovery. Computational argumentation is a growing area in AI that has evolved to provide a sound formal model on how arguments are structured, evaluated, and utilized in various contexts, relying on natural language and machine learning techniques. This paper presents  Polviz  , a novel framework for assessing opinion polarization combining visual analytics and computational argumentation. We provide a characterization of conceptual elements associated with argument-based models (argument, conflict, etc.) oriented towards modeling opinion polarization in social media. We also provide a toolkit of visual analytics tools that allow us to navigate among different models for opinion polarization. Ultimate results corresponding to knowledge emerging from the resulting models are obtained by including a “human in the loop” at the end of the analysis.},

abstract = {This research investigates the potential of AI-generated media in enabling users to create and engage with alternate versions of reality. Drawing inspiration from the speculative design approaches, we propose leveraging modern AI techniques for the procedural generation of text, audio, and video to construct interactive possible futures. As a proof of concept, we developed "OpenOpenAI," a web platform that harnesses AI to depict varying renditions of a hypothetical 2024 keynote address by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, based on user input. Although the platform may not influence the actual direction of the keynote address by Sam Altman and the direction of OpenAI, the system encourages participants to explore and imagine other ways that AI development could go and reminds them of alternate choices and values they could advocate for. Through a pilot user study, we seek to answer two research questions: 1) How might AI-generated media help users expand their perceived range of possible futures? and 2) How might a tool for simulating alternate realities be used to better understand the general public’s opinion on the explored topic? The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the responsible use of AI for exploring speculative futures and understanding public opinion on critical issues such as the development of AI.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly creating a place for themselves in society. There are numerous reports, both good and bad, of their use in business, academia, government and society. While some organizations are trying to limit, or eliminate, their use, it appears that it is inevitable they will become a common "tool". In education, there is a fear that students will not acquire critical thinking in the future, but we argue that LLMs will become a tool to assist students with critical thinking, giving guidance, feedback, and assessment. This paper investigates how the current state of LLMs can be integrated into modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) education. Example cases for modeling and simulation development are presented showing how an LLM can assist M&amp;S design and education in anticipation of LLMs becoming a common tool for M&amp;S practitioners. Current limitations are also highlighted, and where possible, short-term solutions are proposed.},

abstract = {Audio-visual speech synthesis (AVSS) is a rapidly gaining prominence in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its widespread applications. AVSS refers to generating the audio-visual speech of a target speaker from the audio input of a source speaker, while preserving the speech content. The sequential steps of the AVSS process include voice conversion (VC) for altering vocal characteristics from the source to the target speaker and audio-visual synthesis (AVS) to generate a video stream from the converted speech of the target speaker. However, with the progressive development of deep generative models, the domain of AVSS remains relatively unexplored. The existing literature predominantly focuses on autoencoder-based AVSS models, potentially limiting their ability to capture the diversity of the vocal features and also synthesize the realistic video output. This paper introduces a novel AVSS approach utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, enriched with a capsule network (Caps-Net) architecture to effectively capture relevant input speech features and produce more natural audio-visual output. The proposed framework is trained and tested on VoxCeleb2 and LRS3-TED datasets and the experimental outcomes exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

In this context, Augmented Reality (AR) has been adopted in cultural venues to break the passive watching experience, turning the audience into active participants. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of LanternOperAR, a hybrid cultural gift to promote Yue Opera with the Chinese philosophy of Yangmingism. We incorporate the tangible interface and virtual content to create an interactive cultural experience. Specifically, we conducted a fieldwork study to investigate the promises and challenges of promoting Yue Opera. Based on expert interviews and an online survey with the public, we derived a set of design goals to guide the design and development process. Our approach incorporates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) image processing, generative AI, information visualization, and gamification with AR technology to generate and visualize cultural knowledge in AR-based narratives and interactions. We evaluated LanternOperAR with 20 participants and acquired some positive feedback on system usability and overall experience, as well as some suggestions for further improvements. Our findings provide insights into the design of cultural products and cultural applications as guidance for cultural researchers and practitioners.},

Network Digital Twins, which simulate networks in the digital domain for evaluation, offer a solution to these challenges. This concept is further enhanced by generative AI technology, which promises more efficient and accurate AI-driven data generation for network simulation and optimization. This survey provides insights into generative AI-empowered network digital twins. We begin by outlining the architecture of a network digital twin, which encompasses both digital and physical domains. This architecture involves four key steps: data processing and network monitoring, digital replication and network simulation, designing and training network optimizers, Sim2Real, and network control. Next, we systematically discuss the related studies in each step and make a detailed taxonomy of the problem studied, the methods used, and the key designs leveraged. Each step is examined with a focus on the role of generative AI, from estimating missing data and simulating network behaviors to designing control strategies and bridging the gap between digital and physical domains. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges of generative AI-based network digital twins.},

abstract = {The challenges posed by the Dark Silicon era, combined with the escalating computational demands of emerging applications, such as Deep Learning (DL), have strained the capabilities of traditional CPUs and GPUs, necessitating the development of Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs). Despite offering substantial enhancements in Power, Performance, and Area (PPA), DSAs encounter significant challenges, including the rapid evolution of applications that necessitate the frequent development of new architectures. This, coupled with the expertise-intensive nature of the design process, often leads to reduced flexibility and extended development cycles, ultimately hindering the broader adoption and efficient deployment of DSAs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM-AID, an agile framework that streamlines the DSA design flow by transforming high-level abstract specifications into Hardware Description Language (HDL) code and facilitating backend Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool operations. By synergistically combining Large Language Models (LLMs), High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, design exploration techniques, and symbolic AI, LLM-AID dramatically accelerates design iterations, optimizes hardware performance, and significantly reduces time-to-market. This innovative approach democratizes DSA development, empowering designers to achieve unprecedented productivity while delivering high-quality DSA solutions.},

Qualitative and quantitative analyses identified 78 tactics across five categories and provided insight into how and why different interface features were used. We find evidence that pre-task confidence and trust both influenced which interface feature was used. In both systems, but particularly when using the chat feature, trust was often misplaced in favour of ease-of-use and seemingly perfect answers, leading to increased confidence post-search despite having incorrect results.

Recent literature has surveyed the use of text-to-image models for enhancing the work of many creative artists. Many e-commerce platforms employ a manual process to generate the banners, which is time-consuming and has limitations of scalability. In this work, we demonstrate the use of text-to-image models for generating personalized web banners with dynamic content for online shoppers based on their interactions. The novelty in this approach lies in converting users' interaction data to meaningful prompts without human intervention. To this end, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to systematically extract a tuple of attributes from item meta-information. The attributes are then passed to a text-to-image model via prompt engineering to generate images for the banner. Our results show that the proposed approach can create high-quality personalized banners for users.},

While emerging approaches for controlling diffusion models have enabled users to specify the desired spatial layouts of the generated content, they cannot predict or control where viewers will pay more attention due to the complexity of human vision. Recognizing the significance of attention-controllable image generation in practical applications, we present a saliency-guided framework to incorporate the data priors of human visual attention mechanisms into the generation process. Given a user-specified viewer attention distribution, our control module conditions a diffusion model to generate images that attract viewers’ attention toward the desired regions. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we performed an eye-tracked user study and a large-scale model-based saliency analysis. The results evidence that both the cross-user eye gaze distributions and the saliency models’ predictions align with the desired attention distributions. Lastly, we outline several applications, including interactive design of saliency guidance, attention suppression in unwanted regions, and adaptive generation for varied display/viewing conditions.},

Based on the results, it has emphasized their strengths and weaknesses and the importance of further modifications to increase the reliability and accuracy of the latest popular models. Although these AI assistants illustrate a high level of progress in language understanding and code generation, along with ethical considerations and responsible usage, they provoke a necessity for discussion. With time, developing more refined AI technology is essential for achieving advanced solutions in various fields, especially with the knowledge of the feature intricacies of these models and their implications. This study offers a comparison of different LLMs and provides essential feedback on the rapidly changing area of AI models. It also emphasizes the need for ethical developmental practices to actualize AI models’ full potential.},

abstract = {The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based image generators with the ability to output consistently higher quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B industry&nbsp;[125]. However, many professional artists have spoken up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content as training data without their consent.},

abstract = {The development of Automatic Question Generation (QG) models has the potential to significantly improve educational practices by reducing the teacher workload associated with creating educational content. This paper introduces a novel approach to educational question generation that controls the topical focus of questions. The proposed Topic-Controlled Question Generation (T-CQG) method enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the generated content for educational purposes. Our approach uses fine-tuning on a pre-trained T5-small model, employing specially created datasets tailored to educational needs. The research further explores the impacts of pre-training strategies, quantisation, and data augmentation on the model’s performance. We specifically address the challenge of generating semantically aligned questions with paragraph-level contexts, thereby improving the topic specificity of the generated questions. In addition, we introduce and explore novel evaluation methods to assess the topical relatedness of the generated questions. Our results, validated through rigorous offline and human-backed evaluations, demonstrate that the proposed models effectively generate high-quality, topic-focused questions. These models have the potential to reduce teacher workload and support personalised tutoring systems by serving as bespoke question generators. With its relatively small number of parameters, the proposals not only advance the capabilities of question generation models for handling specific educational topics but also offer a scalable solution that reduces infrastructure costs. This scalability makes them feasible for widespread use in education without reliance on proprietary large language models like ChatGPT.},

To use these effectively, it's important to understand workload characteristics. However, workload characterization can be complex and difficult to scale manually due to multiple signals involved. In this study, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of first-party workloads at Microsoft to understand their characteristics. Through this empirical study, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What are the critical workload characteristics that impact efficiency and reliability on cloud platforms? (2) How do these characteristics vary across different workloads? (3) How can cloud platforms leverage these insights to efficiently characterize all workloads at scale? This study provides a deeper understanding of workload characteristics and their impact on cloud performance, which can aid in optimizing cloud services and identifies potential areas for future research.},

In our case study, we focused on email messages. For the purpose of experiments, we used a combination of publicly available email datasets with our in-house data, containing in total over 10k emails. Then, we generated their “copies” using large language models (LLMs) with specific prompts. We experimented with various classifiers and feature spaces. We achieved encouraging results, with the F1-scores of almost 0.99 for email messages in English and over 0.92 for the ones in Polish, using Random Forest as a classifier. We found that the detection model relied strongly on typographic and orthographic (spelling) imperfections of the analyzed emails and on statistics of sentence lengths. We also observed the inferior results obtained for Polish, highlighting a need for research in the direction of languages underrepresented in training models.},

abstract = {Although the diffusion model has achieved remarkable performance in the field of image generation, its high inference delay hinders its wide application in edge devices with scarce computing resources. Therefore, many training-free sampling methods have been proposed to reduce the number of sampling steps required for diffusion models. However, they perform poorly under a very small number of sampling steps. Thanks to the emergence of knowledge distillation technology, the existing training scheme methods have achieved excellent results at very low step numbers. However, the current methods mainly focus on designing novel diffusion model sampling methods with knowledge distillation. How to transfer better diffusion knowledge from teacher models is a more valuable problem but rarely studied. Therefore, we propose Relational Diffusion Distillation (RDD), a novel distillation method tailored specifically for distilling diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that simply align teacher and student models at pixel level or feature distributions, our method introduces cross-sample relationship interaction during the distillation process and alleviates the memory constraints induced by multiple sample interactions. Our RDD significantly enhances the effectiveness of the progressive distillation framework within the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on several datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) demonstrate that our proposed RDD leads to 1.47 FID decrease under 1 sampling step compared to state-of-the-art diffusion distillation methods and achieving 256x speed-up compared to DDIM strategy.

abstract = {This article aims to explore the consistency between a few popular generative AI robots in the evaluation of e-learning platforms. The three robots adopted in the study were GPT-4, Sage, and Dragonfly, which were requested to award rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) features and capabilities, (2) ease of use and customization, (3) cost, (4) security, (5) customer support, and (6) scalability, of 10 to 20 currently most popular e-learning platforms. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

abstract = {First introduced in 2013, Open OnDemand [5] (openondemand.org) is an innovative, open-source, web-based portal that removes the complexities of research computing (RC) system environments from the end-client, and in so doing, reduces “time to science” for researchers by facilitating their access to RC resources. Through Open OnDemand, RC clients can upload and download files, create, edit, submit and monitor jobs, create and share apps, run graphical user interface-based (GUI) applications and connect to a terminal, all via a web browser, with no client software to install and configure. Open OnDemand greatly simplifies access to RC resources, freeing domain scientists from having to worry about the operating environment and instead focus on their research. It enables computer center staff to support a wide range of clients by simplifying the user interface and experience. The overall impact is that clients can use remote computing resources faster and more efficiently. In this paper, we describe advances to the Open OnDemand platform since it was publicly released to the research computing world in 2017 [4], the community that has developed around it and our plans to leverage these to build an ecosystem to ensure future sustainability of this popular platform.},

We introduce a methodology and a tool inspired by the metaphor of a copilot, a form of human-AI teaming strategy well known for its success in programming tasks. We adopt the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), a suitable candidate formalism that allows general-purpose simulation models to be specified in a simple yet rigorous modular and hierarchical way. The result is DEVS Copilot, an AI-based prototype that we systematically test in a case study that builds several lighting control systems of increasing complexity.

Participants in the multimodal feedback condition were more likely to achieve a safe landing and increased their safe landings more over the experiment compared to other feedback conditions.

A total of 36 sophomore undergraduate pre-service teachers participated in an 8-week quasi-experimental study (with classes lasting 3 hours each week). These pre-service teachers were tasked with creating teaching aids and simulating instructional sessions. The experimental group engaged in small-group collaborative learning assisted by ChatGPT (N=21), while the control group (N=15) conducted conventional collaborative learning. The results indicate that pre-service teachers using ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance in terms of learning performance and cognitive load, though the improvement in STEM teaching literacy was not evident. However, ChatGPT contributed to students' acquisition and comprehension of STEM teaching knowledge. In essence, within a collaborative learning context, ChatGPT exhibits significant potential in addressing complex issues and offering personalized support but also we should mitigate potential risks.

Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly improved bot detection by leveraging the rich relational data within social networks. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: imbalanced feature fusion across different modalities and edge heterophily, which limit their effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose BotBR, a novel bot detection framework. BotBR tackles feature imbalance by employing decision trees to extract behavioral patterns from user-related numerical features and utilizes an attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate multi-modal feature embeddings. To mitigate edge heterophily, BotBR incorporates an edge detector to differentiate between high- and low-reliability edges, optimizing the utilization of structural graph information. Furthermore, a homophily-based graph is introduced for consistency contrastive learning, enhancing the model's robustness. Experimental results on real-world bot detection benchmark datasets demonstrate that BotBR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to classical methods.},

For this, we introduce a reflective essay assignment and propose a reflection-sensitive inductive content analysis to analyze it. Our findings based on seven student reflective essays suggest that important reflection trigger characteristics in data science ethics education include students’ expectations, a new insight, motivators for reflection related to expectations, teaching formats, and emotions.

abstract = {Attack-defense trees, an extension of attack trees, are extensively used by security engineers to document potential countermeasures for security threats present in a system's design. These trees help integrate initial system models with countermeasures, allowing for early testing of their efficiency and impact in the design cycle. Despite advancements in automating attack tree construction, selecting the initial set of countermeasures for conversion into an attack-defense tree remains largely manual. This paper proposes an approach and a tool that extends the TTool-AI attack tree generation feature by leveraging large language models and natural language processing to create a set of countermeasures and generate attack-defense trees based on an input attack tree. To evaluate our contribution, our approach is tested using attack-defense trees generated from attack trees, each representing possible threats to an associated system specification. In addition, we introduce metrics to assess the semantic correctness and completeness of the generated attack-defense trees. We compared, using our metrics, the attack-defense trees created from our methodology to those created by an engineer and found that attack-defense trees created using AI and secondary mitigation data provided better trees than solely using AI. We also discovered that this approach generated trees that were comparable to the quality of attack-defense trees generated from a security engineer at the associate level. From these results, we believe that our contribution could aid engineers in identifying not only appropriate countermeasures for attack trees but also the optimal number of countermeasures, avoiding the complexity of redundant mitigations. Furthermore, our approach complements standard modeling practices, particularly during the initial design phase, reducing the need for time-consuming re-engineering throughout the system's lifecycle.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) started a serious discussion among educators on how LLMs would affect, e.g., curricula, assessments, and students' competencies. Generative AI and LLMs also raised ethical questions and concerns for computing educators and professionals.This experience report presents an assignment within a course on professional competencies, including some related to ethics, that computing master's students need in their careers. For the assignment, student groups discussed the ethical process by Lennerfors et al. by analyzing a case: a fictional researcher considers whether to attend the real CHI 2024 conference in Hawaii. The tasks were (1) to participate in in-class discussions on the case, (2) to use an LLM of their choice as a discussion partner for said case, and (3) to document both discussions, reflecting on their use of the LLM.Students reported positive experiences with the LLM as a way to increase their knowledge and understanding, although some identified limitations. The LLM provided a wider set of options for action in the studied case, including unfeasible ones. The LLM would not select a course of action, so students had to choose themselves, which they saw as coherent.From the educators' perspective, there is a need for more instruction for students using LLMs: some students did not perceive the tools as such but rather as an authoritative knowledge base. Therefore, this work has implications for educators considering the use of LLMs as discussion partners or tools to practice critical thinking, especially in computing ethics education.},

abstract = {Detecting organized political campaigns, commonly known as astroturf campaigns, is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on 𝕏 (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2\texttimes{}-3\texttimes{} improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.},

abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.},

abstract = {Driven by technological progress and, above all, software, our world is becoming ever faster, more flexible and more complex. Vehicles in particular are complex systems due to the number of components, communication, and millions of lines of code. Recent trends such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence further accelerate these developments. As a result, the attack surface of vehicles is constantly increasing. To proactively address future security risks, we present the Automotive Cybersecurity Trend Radar (ACTR), an approach that applies the Innovation Radar methodology to identify and temporally classify emerging technologies relevant for the automotive cybersecurity sector. By systematically analyzing technology trends, academic research, and industry reports, this radar provides a structured view of upcoming challenges and opportunities. Our research highlights key topics for the future, including the impact of post-quantum cryptography, AI-driven security mechanisms, and confidential computing technologies. By incorporating these insights into early-stage strategic planning, manufacturers and suppliers can improve their preparedness for emerging cybersecurity-relevant technologies as well as benefit from technology developments, allowing strategic investments. The ACTR thus serves as a tool for industry stakeholders to anticipate, prioritize, and address automotive cybersecurity challenges before they become critical.},

However, since these tools are often trained on open-source repositories, they may inadvertently reproduce vulnerable code, raising concerns about the security of AI-generated outputs. Aims: In this paper, we aim to investigate how developers perceive code security when using GAI tools. Method: We conducted a survey with 105 software developers with diverse experience levels to gather their perceptions regarding the security of generated code and their suggestions for improving it. Results: While developers reported increased development speed when using GAI tools, many spend additional time on security reviews and documentation of the generated code, and they are worried about the overreliance on AI and vulnerabilities in the code. Only about a quarter of the developers expressed confidence in the code generated by AI, and, moreover, experienced developers perceive that their proficiency in secure coding decreases when using GAI tools. Our results provide organizations with a better understanding of the risks associated with GAI tools and help improve their software security programs.},

abstract = {Making use of ChatGPT in language learning has been heatedly discussed in recent years. Former researchers have assessed its usability in English language learning by analyzing users’ feedback, but only provide little information about how it specifically affects English language learning in regards to its language proficiency or language motivation. Henceforth, to fill the research void, this study is designed to analyze the effects of ChatGPT on English language learning concerning vocabulary learning, automated writing evaluation and writing ability, and learning motivation. By selecting eight targeted studies based on the STARLITE standards, the researcher reviewed the studies and briefly summarized the influences: 1) ChatGPT could assist in extending EFL students’ vocabulary through completing text-based tasks; 2) ChatGPT could improve EFL students’ writing ability via automated writing evaluation; 3) ChatGPT could motivate EFL students to learn due to its personalized replies and diverse forms of providing information. However, this study does not contain an analysis of its effects on English language learning in all aspects such as listening and speaking ability. Thus, further studies could probe into the effects of ChatGPT on other English language learning fields.},

However, this human–AI process brings forth a range of ethical considerations that require careful examination. This study investigates the ethical concerns that arise during the user experience designer (UXer)–AI co-creation process and the evolving role of UXers. Employing a mixed methods approach, combining observational task performance experiments and in-depth interviews, the study captures UXers' perceptions of ethical issues in the UXer-AI co-creation process. The findings shed light on three prominent ethical challenges in the UXer–AI co-creation process: reliability, bias, and unemployment. Consequently, this study emphasizes the crucial role of UXers, such as fact-checking, empathy-based decision making, and effective communication with AI, mitigating these ethical challenges. These findings enhance our understanding of UXers' responsibilities and shed light on the potential of leveraging AI as an effective collaborative tool for task completion.},

Initial studies have shown that language models are capable of producing content that is competitive with content created by humans. However, how can such content be tailored for different social media platforms as part of an organization’s content marketing strategy? To address this question, we evaluate the effectiveness of using GPT-4, to generate cross-platform content for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (currently X). Participants (N = 892) evaluated 30 AI-created content (ACC) and human-created content (HCC). Findings show that ACC scored higher on preference by users, call-to-action, and emotional responses than HCC for Facebook. However, AI’s advantage wanes on Twitter and Instagram, where posts are terser. The results imply that GPT-4 comprehends what type of content to create for different platforms, making it a useful tool for cross-platform content creation.},

Meanwhile, feasibility of applying medium-sized LLMs to aforementioned industry scenarios to achieve performance similar to that of very large-scale base models have also been considered. Through joint application with AIGC large models in three standard industry scenarios: drilling well control, device asset operation and maintenance management, as well as refining device operation guidance searching, it is proven that CISFA agent framework is effective in reducing the engineering application threshold of large models, simplify the prompt process and interpretation of industry mechanisms, and reducing application costs since medium-sized LLM been proven to show similar performance as very-large LLM by the allied application with CISFA.},

abstract = {With the rise of new 3D representations like NeRF and 3D Gaussian splatting, creating realistic 3D scenes is easier than ever before. However, the incompatibility of these 3D representations with existing editing software has also introduced unprecedented challenges to 3D editing tasks. Although recent advances in text-to-image generative models have made some progress in 3D editing, these methods either lack precision or require users to manually specify the editing areas in 3D space, complicating the editing process. To overcome these issues, we propose Edit3D, an innovative 3D editing method designed to enhance editing quality. Specifically, we propose a multi-turn editing framework and introduce an attention-driven open-set segmentation (ADSS) technique within this framework. ADSS allows for more precise segmentation of parts, which enhances the editing precision and minimizes interference with pixels in areas that are not being edited. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning phase, intended to further improve the overall editing quality without compromising the training efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that Edit3D effectively adjusts 3D scenes based on textual instructions. Through continuous and multiple turns of editing, it achieves more intricate combinations, enhancing the diversity of 3D editing effects. Code is available at https://github.com/PeterouZh/Edit3D.},

We introduce a series of speculative and deconstructive probes and present findings from their use in four collaborative design sessions. We then draw on the theoretical tradition of Agonism to identify moments of friction, refusal, and disagreement over the course of these sessions. We contend that this approach offers a politically important alternative to consensus-based collaborative design methods and can even surface new rhetorics of contestation within discourses on technology futures. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of worker-authored research and an initial set opportunities, challenges, and paradoxes as a resource for future efforts to "Design for Agonism."},

abstract = {In the last decade, various scalable agile frameworks have emerged to scale the benefits of agility to wider organizational levels and have become increasingly popular in practice. However, the variety of frameworks has not been widely understood yet. The aim of this paper is to provide a well-organized understanding of the primary dimensions and characteristics of these frameworks. To this end, a taxonomy for scaling agile frameworks was created utilising a systematic method for taxonomy development. The basis for the formal and content-related creation of the taxonomy is a systematic and focused literature review, followed by a qualitative text analysis to extract key framework characteristics, concentrating on the four agile scaling frameworks Scaled Agile Framework, Large-Scale Scrum, Disciplined Agile Delivery and Scrum@Scale. For the validation of the proposed taxonomy, an exemplary categorisation of 2 frameworks in the taxonomy was performed.},

abstract = {The involvement of the general public or volunteers in research has evolved over time. Terms such as ‘subjects’ have been replaced by ‘participants’ and are accompanied by an aspiration to actively engage people in research. Under the banner of Community Citizen Science (CCS), we have seen the public collecting or processing data to support activities led by professional scientists, while recently, we observed a growing interest in bringing together members of communities to examine personally relevant topics and identify solutions that best match their needs. In this study, we captured the perceptions of professional scientists about participants' engagement in research activities. We interviewed 14 academics and researchers from The Open University UK who conduct primary research with human participants, including those explicitly involved in CCS and participatory research. We identified varied roles participants currently have in research, diverse perceptions about the benefits participants may experience from taking part in research, and challenges faced when certain forms of CCS are deployed. Insights from this study resulted in proposing a practical CCS framework with five functions that can enable the democratisation of research practices in the future.&nbsp;},

abstract = {In the AI community, benchmarks to evaluate model quality are well established, but an equivalent approach to benchmarking products built upon generative AI models is still missing. This has had two consequences. First, it has made teams focus on model quality over the developer experience, while successful products combine both. Second, product team have struggled to answer questions about their products in relation to their competitors.In this case study, we share: (1) our process to create robust, enterprise-grade and modular components to support the benchmarking of the developer experience (DX) dimensions of our team’s AI for code offerings, and (2) the components we have created to do so, including demographics and attitudes towards AI surveys, a benchmarkable task, and task and feature surveys. By doing so, we hope to lower the barrier to the DX benchmarking of genAI-enhanced code products.},

abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners’ varying levels of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive) chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81 participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners’ ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension, those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies. Findings highlight the importance of considering learners’ GenAI literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that reduces reliance on learners’ GenAI literacy.},

abstract = {Humanity-centered design is a concept of emerging interest in HCI, one motivated by the limitations of human-centered design. As discussed to date, humanity-centered design is compatible with but goes beyond human-centered design in that it considers entire ecosystems and populations over the long term and centers participatory design. Though the intentions of humanity-centered design are laudable, current articulations of humanity-centered design are incoherent in a number of ways, leading to questions of how exactly it can or should be implemented. In this article, I delineate four ways in which humanity-centered design is incoherent—which can be boiled down to a tendency toward hubris—and propose a more fruitful way forward, a humble approach to humanity-centered design. Rather than a contradiction in terms, “humility” here refers to an organic, piecemeal, patterns-based approach to design that will be good for our being on this earth.},

In an online experiment with 122 participants, results indicate that participants using voice input engaged significantly less in self-disclosure than those using text, a finding associated with reduced perceived anonymity in voice interactions. This effect persisted after accounting for response length, suggesting that the influence of voice input on self-disclosure is not merely due to brevity but also reflects unique psychological responses to voice-based communication. These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of input modality's role in shaping disclosure behavior in user feedback contexts. Practical implications offer design guidance for voice-based feedback systems to encourage more open and authentic feedback in sensitive settings.},

abstract = {The software development life cycle (SDLC) is vital for ensuring the quality of software systems. However, learning SDLC concepts presents unique challenges, such as the need for effective collaboration, real-time interaction, and access to diverse skill sets represented in software development teams. To address these problems, we present DevCoach, a generative AI powered multi-agent system designed to support students learning the SDLC. DevCoach allows students to interact with generative AI agents simulating the different roles in the software development team, engaging in tasks across different phases of SDLC. Through a user study (n = 20), we evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing learning, impact on SDLC deliverables, and support for Community of Inquiry (CoI) elements necessary for effective and supportive learning environments. Our results reveal that students using DevCoach achieved significantly higher learning gains and improved task completion rates across all SDLC phases. The system also supports CoI elements, particularly perceived social presence. Participants also lauded the immediate context-aware feedback, interactive learning environment, and diverse expertise provided by the roles within the multi-agent team. These findings demonstrate the potential of generative AI to enhance software engineering education by making it more effective, engaging, and interactive, providing students with collaborative and practical learning experiences.},

Group dynamics are sensitive to mood expressions: Positive mood expressions by the facilitator promote cooperation in the group, whereas negative expressions promote conflict. However, whether mood expressions by a social robot facilitator also influence human group dynamics is an open scientific and practical question. To learn more, an experiment (N = 98) was conducted where small groups engaged in a co-design session led by a social robot facilitator. The robot displayed positive, neutral, or negative mood expressions throughout the session. The results showed that positive robot expressions, compared to neutral or negative expressions, increased perceived robot valence. Perceived robot valence increased cooperation and decreased conflict in the human groups. These findings contribute novel insight into how social robots can be used to innovate how co-design is facilitated.},

Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes.},

Thus, recommendations are made here for the four parties involved in the research: the government should formulate laws to strengthen network supervision; schools need to advance the digital reform on talent training models; teachers need to keep up with the latest educational theories to shift their roles; and students need to remain critical and independent thinkers in the age of educational digitalization 2.0.},

Beyond providing quantitative scores and personalized feedback, the system enables researchers to make better decisions by integrating these evaluation results with additional supporting information, such as journal impact factors and altmetrics, thereby optimizing their research performance and RAE submission strategies. The conceptual system architecture consists of four layers: data ingestion, AI processing, decision support, and user interface. This paper focuses on proposing the architectural design of such a GenAI-based DSS, and through a preliminary interface design case study, we demonstrate how the GenAI-based DSS can provide data-driven insights through a human-machine collaborative approach, thereby improving evaluation efficiency. The MetricAI is designed to improve efficiency, transparency, and strategic nature of RAE preparation work.},

abstract = {Traditional supply chain management mainly relies on historical data and static models such as autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA). However, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system still has the disadvantages, including delayed response, inaccurate long tail demand forecasting, and weak risk resistance and so on. Presently generative AI (GenAI) demonstrates the capability to enhance supply chain resilience significantly through synthetic data augmentation, multimodel analysis, and dynamic optimization technologies. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can generate extreme market scenario data to compensate for the lack of historical data and Large Language Model (LLM) can analyze social media public opinion and perceive changes in demand in advance.In this paper, the predictive ability of GenAI for future markets and the possibility of developing supply chain plans was investigated and then the market trends in 2025 and beyond were predicted based on the market data of the latest five years before 2025, using GenAI deep learning and integrating external variables such as economic indicators and simulating multiple future scenarios. The conclusions reveal that one of the most important advantages lies in AI's deep learning ability and foresight, which can identify potential supply chain disruptions in advance within a certain period of time and have adaptability, dynamically adjusting strategies to cope with sudden fluctuations. Besides, the analysis of AI application data in Lenovo, DHL, and Meituan also has been observed that GenAI has the extremely advantages to optimize time and high efficiency of production planning in supply chain management with the improved resource utilization and promoted growth of transaction order volume. Moreover, the fitting curves between the functions learned by GenAI combined with Python and traditional artificial learning models were compared, whereas, it was found that GenAI deep learning models still have shortcomings and face the challenge of data dispersion and inconsistency in supply chain optimization applications. Therefore, in the future, with the development of multimodel AI and causal reasoning, the focus of the technology should be on the research of strengthening the optimization of model algorithms, with assisting the use of mathematical methods to enhance the accuracy of GenAI models, so that this technology can truly become a core tool for dynamically predicting markets.},

Evaluation used BLEU, Perplexity, and a custom Style Consistency Score. As a result, the K-means-enhanced model improved fluency and style consistency over the baseline. This method provides a quantitative approach to improving generative models in traditional cultural domains.},

This paper attempts to enhance the detection performance of small targets by integrating the bionic perception of brain-inspired intelligence with the data augmentation capabilities of generative models. Firstly, we simulate the multi-scale attention mechanism of the biological visual system using a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), enhancing the spatial sensitivity of small target detection. Secondly, we generate high-quality small target samples and optimize local feature representation through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), alleviating data scarcity and feature ambiguity. This paper proposes for the first time a solution providing a cross-modal collaborative framework for small target detection, exploring the potential of combining brain-inspired mechanisms with generative models.},

This paper focuses on how refined textual prompt design can enhance the precision of image generation. It systematically analyzes the linguistic strategies used in subject description, environment construction, style constraints, lighting control, and compositional elements. By comparing the outcomes of vague prompts with those of detailed prompts, the study demonstrates that clear attribute specifications (such as age, ethnicity, and emotional state), spatiotemporal scene details (e.g., weather conditions, background dynamics), and explicit boundary settings (e.g., negation constraints, spatial symmetry) are critical to reducing image distortion and enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, the paper proposes a multi-element prompt template to serve as a practical linguistic control framework for image generation tasks. The study emphasizes that prompts are not merely input commands but essential logical units for output regulation, and their refinement is vital for improving both the quality and controllability of AI-generated images.},

AI recommendations reduced IP selection by 46 percentage points, elevated scenario-congruent items to top rank, and cut composite satisfaction by 0.5 points despite faster choices. The findings reveal that scenario tags supplant brand salience as the dominant cue and uncover an efficiency–affect trade-off inherent in algorithmic curation.

As artificial intelligence(AI) continues to be widely applied in the fields of law and contract management, users' awareness of potential risks significantly affects their usage experience. The research indicates that concerns regarding data privacy and legal compliance often create discomfort among users, which in turn reduces their satisfaction levels. Additionally, the study highlights a strong demand for platform reasonable risk point alerts and user support, emphasizing the importance of enhancing user trust when promoting AI contract generation technologies. Although this study has limitations, including a small sample size and potential self-report bias, it provides a new perspective for understanding the relationship between risk perception and user satisfaction. Based on the findings, it is recommended that future research adopt diverse sampling methods and qualitative approaches to gain deeper insights into this field, considering the characteristics and needs of different user groups. Ultimately, establishing more transparent communication mechanisms and providing effective user support will be key strategies for enhancing user satisfaction, thereby facilitating the broader application and long-term development of AI technologies within the legal domain.},

abstract = {The low-resource named entity recognition (NER) task faces the dual challenges of sparse annotation data and under-utilised syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose the Syntax-CLNP model, which solves the above problems through two core innovations: firstly, we design the Syntax-Aware Adapter, which dynamically injects dependent syntactic features by using differentiable syntactic projectors to realise semantic-syntactic collaborative characterisation; secondly, we propose the Contrastive Prototype Alignment (CPA) mechanism, which integrates contrastive learning and prototype network to strengthen the syntactic structure by gradient decoupling and enhance the syntactic structure through gradient decoupling. Prototype Alignment (CPA) mechanism is proposed, which integrates contrastive learning and prototype network, and strengthens intra-class feature compactness and inter-class separation through gradient decoupling to suppress noise interference. The experimental results show that on low resource datasets such as LingNER-40 (40 languages) and WikiANN, the F1 value of Syntax-CLNP is improved by 8.7\% on average compared with the baseline model (p&lt;0.01), the number of parameters increases by only 1\% (111M), and the increase in inference latency is less than 4\% (8.5ms), which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency. In the cross-language migration test, the model achieves 58.9\% F1 in low-resource scenarios such as Tamil (&lt;1k samples), verifying the generalisation capability. The study achieves the first end-to-end joint optimisation of syntactic tree and representation learning, providing an efficient solution for low-resource multilingual NER tasks.},

To explore the impact of government subsidies and the fair concern behavior of third-party recyclers on the decision-making and member utility of CLSC, this paper constructs a three-layer model of CLSC composed of manufacturers, retailers and third-party recyclers, and studies the Stackelberg game situation dominated by retailers. Third-party recyclers take the retailer's profit as the reference point for fair concern, and their utility function includes profit and fair concern loss. The government provides subsidies to enterprises that produce remanufactured products. In this paper, the inverse solution method is adopted to derive the equilibrium solution of the game, and Stackelberg game theory is applied for analysis and case simulation. The research results show that under the dominance of retailers, the utility of manufacturers and retailers is not affected by the fairness concern coefficient of recyclers, and the relationship between the utility of recyclers and the fairness relationship coefficient depends on the level of government subsidies. Subsidies increase the profits of retailers.},

This study proposes an interpretable hybrid machine learning model, ExHybridNet, for enterprise financial risk prediction. This model effectively captures dynamic nonlinear relationships in financial data through a three-path fusion architecture of convolutional neural networks, attention mechanism and random forest. ExHybridNet also provides transparent feature importance explanations through SHAP analysis.

The research results of SHAP analysis have revealed the roles of risk drivers such as high leverage ratio (D/A) and short-term borrowing dependence (STBD), as well as risk mitigation factors such as profit stability (EV) and tangible asset ratio (TAR), providing actionable insights for enterprise financial management, risk prevention and risk control.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an innovative multimodal emotion perception framework to improve the accuracy of financial volatility prediction by fusing social media graphic data. Traditional studies mainly rely on a single textual modality, which makes it difficult to capture the implicit emotions in visual information and the scarcity of labelled data in the financial domain. In this paper, we propose three core innovations: combining social media text (e.g., comments) and images (e.g., emoticons, news screenshots) to achieve adaptive fusion of graphical and textual features through a cross-modal attention mechanism to improve the completeness of emotion representation; adopting a two-stage strategy of pre-training and fine-tuning; and utilising a general multimodal dataset (MVSA) to pre-train the model, and using a two-stage strategy of pre-training to fine-tune the model. The two-stage strategy of ‘pre-training-fine-tuning’ is adopted to pre-train the model using the Universal Multimodal Data Set (MVSA), and then fine-tune it with the financial domain corpus to alleviate the problem of data scarcity; the multimodal sentiment factor is embedded into the classical HAR volatility model to construct the Sentiment-HAR model, and the leading effect of sentiment index on volatility is verified by the Granger causality test (γ=0.15,p=0.001). The experimental results show that the multimodal fusion model sentiment classification accuracy reaches 78\% (8.3\% improvement over the single-text model), and the sentiment index is significantly positively correlated with market volatility (Pearson r=0.32p&lt;0.01). The model robustly captures the dynamic correlation between sentiment and volatility during extreme events such as the COVID-19 epidemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This study provides new theoretical and instrumental support for financial sentiment analysis and quantitative trading strategy design.},

abstract = {This study constructs a machine learning-driven multi-factor model for Ethereum quantitative trading, combining traditional technical indicators (RSI, MACD), on-chain metrics (gas usage, active addresses), and X platform social sentiment to predict short-term returns. Backtesting from Q4 2021 to Q3 2024, using online learning and genetic algorithms for dynamic factor updates, yields a 97\% annualized return, a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, and an information ratio of 1.2, outperforming Ethereum's raw returns. Simulated trading in Q4 2024 (bull market) achieves a 33\% quarterly return with an 18\% maximum drawdown, while Q1 2025 (bear market) records a -10\% quarterly return with a 12\% drawdown, confirming robustness. Technical and sentiment factors drive performance, though a 22\% maximum drawdown in backtesting highlights volatility risks. An optimal Z-score threshold (±1.0) and 4-hour trading frequency balance profitability and costs. Future enhancements include high-frequency mainnet data integration and advanced risk management to strengthen model resilience in Ethereum's volatile market.},

abstract = {With the accelerating development of digital cultural dissemination, how to effectively promote folk cultural heritage through social networks has become a pressing issue. Traditional dissemination paths often rely on manually defined rules and lack dynamic adaptability to social structures and user behaviors, which significantly limits the reach and influence of intangible cultural heritage. This paper proposes a dissemination path optimization algorithm based on Deep Q-Learning, constructing a dynamic decision-making model grounded in social networks to enable adaptive adjustment of cultural dissemination strategies. The proposed model incorporates node behavioral features, interaction feedback, and network topology into the state space, and optimizes the path selection through the reinforcement learning process. Experimental results demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of dissemination coverage, user engagement, and transmission efficiency. The study further validates the feasibility of reinforcement learning in the intelligent optimization of cultural dissemination and provides a novel theoretical and technical foundation for the digital promotion of intangible cultural heritage.},

abstract = {In the context of digital transformation, enterprises increasingly rely on high-quality data mining techniques to enhance the scientific basis and foresight of investment decisions. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods face limitations in modeling the temporal dependencies inherent in financial and market data, making it difficult to capture long-term trends effectively. To address this challenge, this study proposes a corporate return on investment (ROI) prediction model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model integrates corporate financial indicators, market behavior data, and macroeconomic variables to construct a deep learning framework for multivariate time series analysis. A sliding window mechanism and unified data preprocessing pipeline are developed to improve the model's capability of learning complex dynamic patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms benchmark methods such as ARIMA and SVR in terms of mean squared error, mean absolute error, and trend prediction accuracy, showing superior stability and long-term forecasting ability. This research confirms the feasibility of applying deep learning techniques to enterprise financial modeling and provides theoretical support and methodological reference for building intelligent investment research systems.},

abstract = {Online learning platforms contain rich graph data, laying a good foundation for the application of Graph Neural Network technology. As online learning platforms grow rapidly, offering precise course recommendations has gradually become crucial for their sustainable development. However, current recommendation models often suffer from insufficient mining of course's information and inadequate capture of higher-order connectivity information. Therefore, we propose a Courses Recommendation Model Incorporating Course Information into SubGraph Convolutional Network (IISGCN-CR). The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to extract the textual information of the course for the initial embedding representation of the course. Then the learner subgraphs and course subgraphs are constructed based on the similarity of learner's interests and the similarity of courses and perform graph convolution on the subgraphs to learn high-order information about learners and courses. Subsequently, the embedding representations obtained in the graph convolution are weighted and aggregated using the attention mechanism to obtain the final vector representations of learners and courses. Finally, the prediction scores are obtained by the operation of the vector inner product and the recommendation of courses is made based on the prediction results. Experiments are conducted on the MOOCCube and MovieLens-1M datasets and the model improves the recommendation results compared to the better-performing baseline method.},

To address the increasing complexity of cigarette transportation tasks, coordinated multi-vehicle distribution through route optimization has become a key strategy to enhance delivery efficiency and reduce costs. This study formulates a mathematical model for the multi-vehicle cigarette distribution routing problem, aiming to minimize total transportation costs, and employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for solution. To address the issue of imbalanced task allocation among vehicles observed in the WOA solution process, the algorithm is enhanced to achieve balanced distribution of delivery tasks while minimizing transportation costs.

abstract = {Effective university–industry collaboration remains elusive, largely because firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, struggle to identify trustworthy academics whose expertise aligns with their technical needs. We address this problem by introducing MMKG-SNR, a ranking framework that fuses (i) a Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) grounding textual and visual evidence from publications and patents with (ii) an enriched Social-Network (SN) graph that captures citation ties, institutional links, and fine-grained company–scholar interaction logs obtained from the Jiangxi Online Technology Trading Platform (OTTP). Requirement texts are used as external keys in a hand-in-hand dual-stream Transformer to retrieve context from the MMKG, while RotatE embeddings model relational trust in the SN graph, augmented with newly formalized company–scholar edges. The two signal sources are combined through a query-conditioned gating mechanism, and a pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss trains a two-layer neural scorer to optimize the final ordering. Experiments on real OTTP collaboration cases show that MMKG-SNR improves recall and nDCG over strong content-only and trust-only baselines, demonstrating its ability to surface scholars who are both technically relevant and socially credible. Ablation analyses confirm that requirement-anchored keys, company–scholar edges, and the learn-to-rank objective each contribute significant, complementary gains. The framework provides a reproducible, extensible blueprint for reducing information asymmetry and accelerating knowledge transfer in technology-driven economies.},

abstract = {Novelty assessment is a cornerstone of technological innovation and intellectual property protection, profoundly influencing national technology strategies and economic development. Traditional evaluation models, which rely on domain experts, face significant challenges, including subjectivity, inconsistency, and low efficiency. These issues are exacerbated by the surging volume of global patent applications. While generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues for automation, their prevalent use of implicit reasoning often leads to "hallucinations" and weak discrimination capabilities, rendering them unsuitable for the logically rigorous task of patent novelty assessment. To address this gap, this paper introduces TCL-MFSNE (Temporal-Contrastive Learning Multi-Agent Framework with Byzantine Consensus for Scientific Novelty Evaluation), an advanced multi-agent framework designed to systematically enhance the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of evaluations. The core of TCL-MFSNE rests on three pillars: (1) Explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning, which guides the model to generate detailed, transparent reasoning steps, overcoming the black-box nature of implicit reasoning. (2) Two-Dimensional Contrastive Learning, which includes "Positive-Negative Contrastive Learning" to sharpen the model's ability to discern key novel features by learning from paired authorized and unauthorized patents, and "Temporal Contrastive Learning" to ensure evaluations are accurately contextualized within the historical technological landscape. (3) Byzantine Consensus Mechanism, which leverages multiple heterogeneous LLM agents for independent evaluations and employs a consensus algorithm to filter out individual agent errors or biases, ensuring a stable and reliable final decision. We conducted comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of patents filed between 2008 and 2024. The results demonstrate that the TCL-MFSNE framework achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 85\%, significantly outperforming baseline models such as implicit LLMs, single-agent systems, and other ablation variants. This research not only provides a viable solution for automated patent novelty assessment but also offers a new paradigm for applying generative AI to other professional domains that demand high precision and strong logical coherence.},

This paper proposes a joint model named GAT-SAL, which integrates subword attention mechanisms and graph attention networks to address semantic loss caused by BERT's Wordpiece tokenization and to enhance bidirectional semantic interactions between intent and slot features. The model adopts a two-stage feature fusion strategy: in the first stage, the GAT module explicitly constructs a semantic graph between intent and slot features; in the second stage, the subword attention fusion layer enriches the semantic representation of complex words by aggregating subword-level information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, ATIS and SNIPS, demonstrate that GAT-SAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including intent classification accuracy, slot filling F1 score, and sentence-level semantic frame accuracy. Specifically, the model achieves 98.54\% intent accuracy, 97.22\% slot filling F1, and 89.70\% sentence-level accuracy on the ATIS dataset; and 98.72\%, 97.60\%, and 92.86\% respectively on the SNIPS dataset. In addition, ablation studies further confirm the importance of each module (SAL, GAT, and CRF) in contributing to the overall performance of the model.},

An Adaptive Defect Attention Block (ADAB) is incorporated to enhance the representation of subtle defect features through combined spatial and channel-wise attention. A multi-channel hybrid loss function supervises both image content and defect mask consistency, promoting structural coherence and stable training. Experimental evaluations on the Cotton Fabric and MVTec datasets reveal that the proposed method consistently surpasses diffusion-based baselines—including DDPM, Sin-Diffusion, and Defect-Gen—across various metrics such as LPIPS, DISTS, PSNR, FID, and SSIM.

abstract = {While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2\% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7\% in comparison with the best baseline model.},

abstract = {With the development of The Times, the importance of financial robots to today's society has become increasingly prominent, the current financial robots have gone beyond the initial positioning of "automated tools", its core advantage is to reduce the economic threshold, users only need a small amount of money to enjoy low rates, high transparency of automated investment management. This paper uses scientific quantitative analysis methods to select research papers from 1990 to 2024 and conduct a systematic review. Based on the 127 papers retrieved, it uses Bibliometrics' to analyze and visualize the documents. In conclusion, the study affirms the role of financial robots in the future era and points out that they have significantly improved the timeliness and objectivity of investment decisions. Scholarly inquiry into robot-advisors emerged during an embryonic phase of conceptual exploration circa 2017, subsequently undergoing accelerated proliferation to attain a research apogee by 2023—a trajectory that epitomizes the discipline's ascendant status within modern academic priorities. Concurrently, Chinese academics have emerged as preeminent contributors to this global intellectual ecosystem, exhibiting not only the highest density of scholarly output but also pioneering methodological rigor and cross-disciplinary influence, as evidenced by citation dominance and paradigm-shifting theoretical frameworks. Empirical syntheses further delineate robot-advisors as a transformative force in institutional praxis, particularly through their reconfiguration of investor engagement protocols, decision-support architectures, and accountability matrices in algorithmic governance. These multifaceted contributions collectively cement their indispensability as both operational infrastructure and epistemological catalysts within contemporary financial technology discourse.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.},

abstract = {Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input–output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8\% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.},

A double-dynamic movement primitive (DMP) is introduced to model robot motion, including a baseline DMP for learning to generate the desired trajectory, and a virtual DMP for generating a reference trajectory, which can compensate for the effect caused by task uncertainties by designing the coupling term and time scaling factor in DMP model. Besides, a kinematics feedback controller of adaptive gain for redundant manipulator is designed to track the position and orientation trajectory in Cartesian space. The proposed method applies the double-DMP model to realize the adaptation at both planning level and control level. Without a complex controller design, it improves the tracking performance of the demonstrated trajectory under task uncertainties, which is convenient for a practical environment. The experiments have been carried out on a Kinova robot, the results have confirmed the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {In the field of intelligent financial analytics, traditional rule-based and statistical methods often struggle with low efficiency and limited generalizability when handling large-scale corporate reporting data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multi-task model for the automatic classification and forecasting of financial statements. By encoding structured financial tables into matrix form and applying a custom-designed CNN architecture with shared and task-specific layers, the model jointly performs corporate health classification and key indicator prediction. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of 90 publicly listed companies across three major industries, utilizing real-world balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow reports. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline models such as SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, achieving a classification F1-score of 91.5\% and a regression R² of 0.852. Ablation studies further validate the importance of convolutional depth and multi-task learning in improving generalization and accuracy. The model offers a scalable and adaptable solution for enterprise-level financial document processing, with potential applications in automated risk assessment, credit analysis, and audit support systems.},

abstract = {Anti-money laundering (AML) has attracted significant attention in recent years, aiming to detect and prevent money laundering, a pernicious financial crime. Among AML algorithms, transaction-graph-based algorithms achieve satisfactory performance by leveraging graph learning methods. However, existing algorithms focus on extracting features from nodes in transaction graphs and overlook a special node type—nodes that served as money mules. Money mules are key links in the money laundering chain, which transfer illicit money for criminals. In this work, we combine graph learning methods with money mules detection to empower AML. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, named MuleTrace, that utilizes money mules as leads to detect money laundering chains in an unsupervised manner. Numerical experiments on real-world money laundering datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the MuleTrace.},

abstract = {The advancement of smart education has made personalized learning path recommendation a key focus area for enhancing the quality of online teaching. To address the limitations of existing recommendation systems in modeling learner interaction structures and adapting to dynamic learning contexts, this paper proposes a learning path optimization model that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed approach constructs a heterogeneous graph to capture multidimensional relationships among students, courses, and knowledge concepts, and leverages GNNs to generate structure-aware node representations. Based on this, a path generation policy network is developed using the PPO algorithm, enabling dynamic and adaptive optimization of personalized learning paths. Experiments conducted on a simulated educational dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in path accuracy, course completion rate, knowledge gain, and recommendation diversity. It also shows enhanced robustness in cold-start scenarios and better control over cognitive coherence. An ablation study further verifies the contribution of key components to overall system performance. This work provides a scalable framework for structural modeling and policy optimization in personalized learning, offering valuable insights for the intelligent development of educational recommendation systems.},

Tesla's camera-based vision solution has insufficient robustness in scenes such as complex lighting and bad weather. The accident rate of Autopilot in extreme weather is 27\% higher than that in normal scenes. This study designs a cross-modal fusion algorithm based on a dynamic weighted attention mechanism for the Tesla HW4.0 platform to address challenges such as multi-sensor spatiotemporal calibration, dynamic scene weight allocation, and computational efficiency optimization. The algorithm realizes data fusion of lidar, camera, and millimeter-wave radar through a four-layer architecture, and uses a scene-adaptive weight mechanism (such as the sunny day weight allocation is [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]) and spatiotemporal correlation modeling to improve perception accuracy in complex scenes. Experiments show that the algorithm achieves 92.1\% mAP@0.5 in heavy rain scenarios, which is 15.6\% higher than the Tesla BEV solution. The detection distance of cone barrels is 68 meters, and the false detection rate is only 6.3\%. The energy efficiency ratio on the Jetson Orin platform is 1.31 FPS/W, which meets the real-time and low power consumption requirements of the vehicle. The research provides an efficient solution for cross-modal fusion of autonomous driving.},

abstract = {In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), the rising computational demands of modern models bring energy efficiency to the forefront of sustainable computing. Preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging, are critical steps in transforming raw text into structured formats suitable for machine learning models. However, despite their widespread use in numerous NLP pipelines, little attention has been given to their energy consumption. This empirical study evaluates and compares the energy consumption and runtime performance of three popular NLP libraries—NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim—across six common preprocessing tasks. We conducted a comprehensive comparison using three distinct datasets and six preprocessing tasks. Energy consumption was measured using the Intel-RAPL and NVIDIA-SMI interfaces, while runtime performance was recorded across all library-task combinations. The results reveal substantial discrepancies in energy consumption across the three libraries, with up to 93\% of cases exhibiting significant variations. Gensim showed superior efficiency in tokenization and stemming, while spaCy excelled in tasks like POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER). These findings underscore the potential for optimizing NLP preprocessing tasks for energy efficiency. Our study highlights the untapped potential for improving energy efficiency in NLP pipelines. These insights emphasize the need for more focused research into energy-efficient NLP techniques, especially in the preprocessing phase, to support the development of greener, more sustainable computational models.},

In a mixed-methods experiment, participants (N=120) watched short-form videos featuring VAIIs of varying human-likeness (High/Moderate-High/Moderate-Low/Low) and self-disclosure (present/absent). We observed the strongest message acceptance from the VAIIs with the lowest human-likeness, and message rejection for VAIIs with moderate to low human-likeness. Additionally, participants’ message acceptance was influenced by their empathy tendencies.

abstract = {LLM-based assistants, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, have the potential to generate code that fulfills a programming task described in a natural language description, referred to as a prompt. The widespread accessibility of these assistants enables users with diverse backgrounds to generate code and integrate it into software projects. However, studies show that code generated by LLMs is prone to bugs and may miss various corner cases in task specifications. Presenting such buggy code to users can impact their reliability and trust in LLM-based assistants. Moreover, significant efforts are required by the user to detect and repair any bug present in the code, especially if no test cases are available. In this study, we propose a self-refinement method aimed at improving the reliability of code generated by LLMs by minimizing the number of bugs before execution, without human intervention, and in the absence of test cases. Our approach is based on targeted Verification Questions (VQs) to identify potential bugs within the initial code. These VQs target various nodes within the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the initial code, which have the potential to trigger specific types of bug patterns commonly found in LLM-generated code. Finally, our method attempts to repair these potential bugs by re-prompting the LLM with the targeted VQs and the initial code. Our evaluation, based on programming tasks in the CoderEval dataset, demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by decreasing the number of targeted errors in the code between 21\% to 62\% and improving the number of executable code instances to 13\%.},

abstract = {Grading project reports are increasingly significant in today’s educational landscape, where they serve as key assessments of students’ comprehensive problem-solving abilities. However, it remains challenging due to the multifaceted evaluation criteria involved, such as creativity and peer-comparative achievement. Meanwhile, instructors often struggle to maintain fairness throughout the time-consuming grading process. Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality. However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an instructor’s educational insights into the class situation. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI collaborative grading systems.},

abstract = {Observers and practitioners of artificial intelligence (AI) have proposed an FDA-style licensing regime for the most advanced AI models, or 'frontier' models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

This paper investigates how generative AI can be integrated into documentary practice while maintaining ethical standards. Through interviews with six documentary photographers, we explored their views on AI’s potential to support community-driven storytelling. While AI presents opportunities for creative expression and community involvement, concerns about trust, authenticity, and decontextualization of images persist. Photographers expressed doubts about AI’s ability to accurately represent lived experiences, fearing it could compromise narrative integrity. Our findings suggest that AI tools should be designed to enhance collaboration and transparency in storytelling, complementing rather than replacing traditional documentary methods. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in photography, advocating for the development of tools that preserve the ethical foundations of documentary storytelling while empowering communities.},

abstract = {Filigree art, which represents typical intricate metalwork, has been captivating audiences worldwide with its delicate lace-like patterns and interwoven metal wires’ refined aesthetics. Particularly, Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage filigree craftsmanship has a unique aesthetic value in fine patterns and complex three-dimensional shapes. However, designing and creating filigree artworks is a labor-intensive and technically complex task and often requires extensive training and a deep understanding of the craft, which limits its design aesthetic and cultural continuity. Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) -aided method that uses AI-generated content (AIGC) technology to accelerate the visualization process of this time-consuming and intricate craft by investigating the role of AI in craft design. First, a comprehensive study of filigree art culture is conducted to identify more than ten historic filigree techniques to obtain AI opportunities. Then, an AI-powered framework called AIFiligree is developed by optimizing culture-based labels and training parameters, enabling the generation of highly authentic fine filigree structures. Further, user workflows are introduced to support diverse design scenarios. Through user studies involving 22 filigree experts and 16 designers, we finally gained insights into AI’s opportunities and challenges in cultural learning, expression, and design.},

abstract = {Conversational agents, or chatbots, are increasingly used to access all sorts of services using natural language. While open-domain chatbots – like ChatGPT – can converse on any topic, task-oriented chatbots – the focus of this paper – are designed for specific tasks, like booking a flight, obtaining customer support, or setting an appointment. Like any other software, task-oriented chatbots need to be properly tested, usually by defining and executing test scenarios (i.e., sequences of user-chatbot interactions). However, there is currently a lack of methods to quantify the completeness and strength of such test scenarios, which can lead to low-quality tests, and hence to buggy chatbots. To fill this gap, we propose adapting mutation testing (MuT) for task-oriented chatbots. To this end, we introduce a set of mutation operators that emulate faults in chatbot designs, an architecture that enables MuT on chatbots built using heterogeneous technologies, and a practical realisation as an Eclipse plugin. Moreover, we evaluate the applicability, effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on open-source chatbots, with promising results.},

abstract = {Eating is a vital, social, and intimate experience. Eating with others positively influences our health and mood and enhances our social relationships. However, sometimes, we lack the time, or the circumstances do not allow us to have this intimate experience physically. Current technology, such as video calls, somehow helps bridge the gap of physicality. However, they provide only a fraction of the social experience that face-to-face interaction allows. Recent progress in Immersive Telepresence and eXtended Reality (XR) enables an opportunity to redefine digital commensality, not only to overcome the gap of physical distance, but also to go beyond and redefine the experience of eating. In this paper, we–a multidisciplinary team of technology and commensality researchers–envision the future of digital commensality through immersive technology. To this end, we conducted two participatory co-design workshops and used iterative analysis to identify a set of design criteria that were applied to a working prototype system: the XR Table.},

The model was fine-tuned with trip reports describing the experience of eating psychedelic mushrooms.

Results reveal ontological surprises, leading to the proposal of entangled authorship to de-individualise the production of knowledge from a More Than Human perspective.

However, enthusiasts and researchers have struggled to accurately describe Jubensha, often defaulting to comparisons with genres like murder mystery and live-action role-playing games. This reliance on comparisons hinders efforts to generalize Jubensha or to deconstruct and adapt its unique design components, dynamics of player interaction, and playing experience into other games. This research provides a taxonomy and analysis of Jubensha games, based on a thematic analysis of over 80 Jubensha games accessed through mobile applications and physical copies. The analysis combines the authors’ positionalities as native Chinese and English speakers and lenses from close reading of the games, discourse analysis, and distributed cognition. We provide summative case studies to exemplify our taxonomy and discuss design implications for Jubensha games for future projects. Our work provides a descriptive tool and vocabulary for researchers and designers to facilitate communication and theorize the evolving Jubensha gaming phenomenon highlighting how gameplay centers collaborative sensemaking. In addition, we argue that the design of game narratives in Jubensha games, including structures in scripts and the evolving performance of players, can be generalized and transferred to the design of a wider range of analog and video games.},

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT introduces the potential for exacerbating this concern. However, prior works on the ethics and risks of emergent LLMs either overlook the practical implications in real-world scenarios, lag behind rapid NLP advancements, lack user consensus on ethical risks, or fail to holistically address the entire spectrum of ethical considerations. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate, qualitatively explore and catalog ethical dilemmas and risks in ChatGPT through benchmarking with eight representative datasets and red teaming involving diverse case studies. Our findings show that while ChatGPT demonstrates superior safety performance on benchmark datasets, its guardrails can be bypassed via our manually curated examples, revealing not only the limitations of current benchmarks for risk assessment but also unexplored risks in five distinct scenarios, including social bias in code generation, bias in cross-lingual question answering, toxic language in personalized dialogue, misleading information from hallucination, and prompt injections for unethical behaviors. We conclude with implications from red teaming ChatGPT and recommendations for designing future responsible large language models.},

The system features a parallel collaboration workflow in place of the turn-taking conversational interactions. It defines multiple ''microtasks'' to simulate group collaboration scenarios such as collaborative writing and group brainstorming. Instead of repetitively prompting a chatbot for various purposes, Polymind enables users to orchestrate multiple microtasks simultaneously. Users can configure and delegate customised microtasks, and manage their microtasks by specifying task requirements and toggling visibility and initiative. Our evaluation revealed that, compared to ChatGPT, users had more customizability over collaboration with Polymind, and were thus able to quickly expand personalised writing ideas during prewriting.},

Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95\% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

abstract = {Traditionally, software vulnerability detection research has focused on individual small functions due to earlier language processing technologies’ limitations in handling larger inputs. However, this function-level approach may miss bugs that span multiple functions and code blocks. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled processing of larger inputs, leading everyday software developers to increasingly rely on chat-based large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to detect vulnerabilities across entire files, not just within functions. This new development practice requires researchers to urgently investigate whether commonly used LLMs can effectively analyze large file-sized inputs, in order to provide timely insights for software developers and engineers about the pros and cons of this emerging technological trend. Hence, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art chat-based LLMs, including the GPT models, in detecting in-file vulnerabilities. We conducted a costly investigation into how the performance of LLMs varies based on vulnerability type, input size, and vulnerability location within the file. To give enough statistical power (β ≥ .8) to our study, we could only focus on the three most common (as well as dangerous) vulnerabilities: XSS, SQL injection, and path traversal. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting these vulnerabilities is strongly influenced by both the location of the vulnerability and the overall size of the input. Specifically, regardless of the vulnerability type, LLMs tend to significantly (p &lt; .05) underperform when detecting vulnerabilities located toward the end of larger files—a pattern we call the lost-in-the-end effect. Finally, to further support software developers and practitioners, we also explored the optimal input size for these LLMs and presented a simple strategy for identifying it, which can be applied to other models and vulnerability types. Eventually, we show how adjusting the input size can lead to significant improvements in LLM-based vulnerability detection, with an average recall increase of over 37\% across all models.},

To predict the B cell epitopes of a novel virus, several algorithms have been developed. While most existing algorithms are trained on a dataset in which B cell epitopes are classified as ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’. However, we found that training on such data contaminates the target pattern of specific viruses, leading to inaccurate predictions in some cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for predicting linear B cell epitopes of novel viruses by exclusively using highly similar viruses for training data. We employed kernel regression based on seropositive rates, which are the percentages of seropositive samples among the population, to predict the potential epitopes. To assess our method, we conducted simulations and utilized two real-world datasets. Our method significantly outperformed other existing methods on the testing data of four viruses with seropositive rates. Also, our strategy showed a better prediction in a larger dataset from the IEDB. Thus, a novel framework providing better linear B cell prediction of newly emerging viruses is established, which will benefit the rational design of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics in the future.},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms (RAs) have been pointed out as one of the major culprits of misinformation spreading in the digital sphere.1 However, it is still unclear how these algorithms propagate misinformation, e.g., which particular recommendation approaches are more prone to suggest misinforming items, or which internal parameters of the algorithms could be influencing more on their misinformation propagation capacity. Motivated by this fact, in this work, we present an analysis of the effect of some of the most popular recommendation algorithms on the spread of misinformation on Twitter (X). A set of guidelines on how to adapt these algorithms is provided based on such analysis and a comprehensive review of the research literature.},

abstract = {Conversational agents - or chatbots - are increasingly used as the user interface to many software services. While open-domain chatbots like ChatGPT excel in their ability to chat about any topic, task-oriented conversational agents are designed to perform goal-oriented tasks (e.g., booking or shopping) guided by a dialogue-based user interaction, which is explicitly designed. Like any kind of software system, task-oriented conversational agents need to be properly tested to ensure their quality. For this purpose, some tools permit defining and executing conversation test cases. However, there are currently no established means to assess the coverage of the design of a task-oriented agent by a test suite, or mechanisms to automate quality test case generation ensuring the agent coverage.To attack this problem, we propose test coverage criteria for task-oriented conversational agents, and define coverage-based strategies to synthesise test scenarios, some oriented to test case reduction. We provide an implementation of the criteria and the strategies that is independent of the agent development platform. Finally, we report on their evaluation on open-source Dialogflow and Rasa agents, and a comparison against a state-of-the-art testing tool. The experiment shows benefits in terms of test generation correctness, increased coverage and reduced testing time.},

abstract = {Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack. In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN. We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations. These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s).While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore "catastrophic memorization," where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it. As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.},

We use speculative and critical design as our approach to avoid abstract guesswork and provide more nuanced and concrete insights into the matter at hand. We conducted five speculative design workshops centered on Infinity Book, a fictional system capable of generating any kind of literary work. Participants used brainwriting, the Future Ripples method, and dialogue-labs to explore potential futures and socio-material impacts of such technology. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was employed to analyze the results from the workshops, and we developed twelve design fictions that illustrate diverse uses and societal implications of GenAI. Based on these results, we formulated three strong concepts, Authenticity, Creative Agency, and Liveness, that link concrete design considerations with broader philosophical discussions.},

abstract = {The world faces escalating crises: record-breaking temperatures, widespread fires, severe flooding, increased oceanic microplastics, and unequal resource distribution. Academia introduces courses around sustainability to meet the new demand, but software engineering education lags behind. While software systems contribute to environmental issues through high energy consumption, they also hold the potential for solutions, such as more efficient and equitable resource management. Yet, sustainability remains a low priority for many businesses, including those in the digital sector. Business as usual is no longer viable. A transformational change in software engineering education is urgently needed. We must move beyond traditional curriculum models and fully integrate sustainability into every aspect of software development. By embedding sustainability as a core competency, we can equip future engineers not only to minimise harm but also to innovate solutions that drive positive, sustainable change. Only with such a shift can software engineering education meet the demands of a world in crisis and prepare students to lead the next generation of sustainable technology. This article discusses a set of challenges and proposes a customisable education roadmap for integrating sustainability into the software engineering curricula. These challenges reflect our perspective on key considerations, stemming from regular, intensive discussions in regular workshops among the authors and the community, as well as our extensive research and teaching experience in the field.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) has been widely applied in UX design, yet its potential in the Journey Map (JM) creation process remains under-explored. We conducted a formative study (N = 24) to identify designers’ needs for GenAI in JM creation, resulting in six design goals (e.g., Acting as Different Stakeholders) implemented in our tool, GeneyMAP. GeneyMAP streamlines the JM creation process, allowing designers to map interview data efficiently with flexibility, uncovering design opportunities through visual inspiration. A subsequent user study (N = 20) demonstrated that GeneyMAP, compared with the common tool, accelerated JM creation and fostered creativity mainly by providing diverse inspirations and facilitating progressive discussions. Our findings proved GeneyMAP’s utility and effectiveness while challenges in maintaining control and trust in GenAI outputs were noted. Our research highlights the promising role of GenAI in refining JM creation practices and suggests implications for incorporating GenAI in JM and design workflows.},

abstract = {Effective patient-provider communication is crucial in clinical care, directly impacting patient outcomes and quality of life. Traditional evaluation methods, such as human ratings, patient feedback, and provider self-assessments, are often limited by high costs and scalability issues. Although existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques show promise, they struggle with the nuances of clinical communication and require sensitive clinical data for training, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. Emerging large language models (LLMs) offer a new approach to assessing complex communication metrics, with the potential to advance the field through integration into passive sensing and just-in-time intervention systems. This study explores LLMs as evaluators of palliative care communication quality, leveraging their linguistic, in-context learning, and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, using simulated scripts crafted and labeled by healthcare professionals, we test proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) and fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2) with a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 to evaluate clinical conversations, to identify key metrics such as ‘understanding’ and ‘empathy’. Our findings demonstrated LLMs’ superior performance in evaluating clinical communication, providing actionable feedback with reasoning, and demonstrating the feasibility and practical viability of developing in-house LLMs. This research highlights LLMs’ potential to enhance patient-provider interactions and lays the groundwork for downstream steps in developing LLM-empowered clinical health systems.},

However, this freedom also presents challenges due to the interplay between components within an IoT design, which can influence the overall utility and performance of the prototype. Optimizing these designs is difficult due to limited means of estimating their efficacy. To address this, we introduce TOAD, a novel tool for profiling IoT prototypes and gauging their performance impact. TOAD uses thermal imaging and video analysis to extract and compare design performance characteristics. Unlike existing solutions that only profile overall performance, our tool assesses component interactions and overall design effects. It offers an affordable, non-intrusive method without needing device access or code instrumentation. Extensive benchmarks show TOAD accurately extracts performance data, aiding in selecting the best design for IoT applications. Additionally, it provides insights into how casing factors like thickness and material influence thermal behavior and performance. We demonstrate practical applications by optimizing offloading decisions based on thermal behavior, highlighting casing impacts on design performance. TOAD paves the way for efficient IoT prototype designs, offering a better understanding of component interactions and significantly enhancing the utility of custom IoT designs and their effectiveness.},

Chatbots can serve as a viable support mechanism in regions with limited resources. This study delves into the perceptions of dementia caregivers in Peru regarding a chatbot tailored to offer care navigation and emotional support. We divided the study into three phases: the initial stage encompassed engaging stakeholders to define design requirements for the chatbot; the second stage focused on the creation of ‘Ana’, a chatbot for dementia caregivers; and the final stage assessed the chatbot through interviews and a caregiver satisfaction survey. ‘Ana’ was tested in two configurations - one employed pre-defined conversation patterns, while the other harnessed generative AI for more dynamic responses. The findings reveal that caregivers seek immediate access to information on handling behavioural symptoms and a platform for emotional release. Moreover, participants preferred the generative AI alternative of Ana, as it was perceived to be more empathic and human-like. The participants valued the generative approach despite knowing the potential risk of receiving inaccurate information.},

We found that students’ applications used MLLMs for important learning environment design features such as multimodal content creation, personalization, and feedback. Based on these findings, we discuss future research directions for the design of multimodality in generative AI educational applications.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of generative AI in software development has impacted the industry, yet its effects on developers with visual impairments remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we used an Activity Theory framework to examine how developers with visual impairments interact with AI coding assistants. For this purpose, we conducted a study where developers who are visually impaired completed a series of programming tasks using a generative AI coding assistant. We uncovered that, while participants found the AI assistant beneficial and reported significant advantages, they also highlighted accessibility challenges. Specifically, the AI coding assistant often exacerbated existing accessibility barriers and introduced new challenges. For example, it overwhelmed users with an excessive number of suggestions, leading developers who are visually impaired to express a desire for “AI timeouts.” Additionally, the generative AI coding assistant made it more difficult for developers to switch contexts between the AI-generated content and their own code. Despite these challenges, participants were optimistic about the potential of AI coding assistants to transform the coding experience for developers with visual impairments. Our findings emphasize the need to apply activity-centered design principles to generative AI assistants, ensuring they better align with user behaviors and address specific accessibility needs. This approach can enable the assistants to provide more intuitive, inclusive, and effective experiences, while also contributing to the broader goal of enhancing accessibility in software development.},

We conducted two large pre-registered parallel experiments involving 1,100 participants attempting tasks targeting the two core components of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking. We compare the effects of two forms of large language model (LLM) assistance—a standard LLM providing direct answers and a coach-like LLM offering guidance—with a control group receiving no AI assistance, and focus particularly on how all groups perform in a final, unassisted stage. Our findings reveal that while LLM assistance can provide short-term boosts in creativity during assisted tasks, it may inadvertently hinder independent creative performance when users work without assistance, raising concerns about the long-term impact on human creativity and cognition.},

abstract = {Privacy poses a significant obstacle to the progress of learning analytics (LA), presenting challenges like inadequate anonymization and data misuse that current solutions struggle to address. Synthetic data emerges as a potential remedy, offering robust privacy protection. However, prior LA research on synthetic data lacks thorough evaluation, essential for assessing the delicate balance between privacy and data utility. Synthetic data must not only enhance privacy but also remain practical for data analytics. Moreover, diverse LA scenarios come with varying privacy and utility needs, making the selection of an appropriate synthetic data approach a pressing challenge. To address these gaps, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data, which encompasses three dimensions of synthetic data quality, namely resemblance, utility, and privacy. We apply this evaluation to three distinct LA datasets, using three different synthetic data generation methods. Our results show that synthetic data can maintain similar utility (i.e., predictive performance) as real data, while preserving privacy. Furthermore, considering different privacy and data utility requirements in different LA scenarios, we make customized recommendations for synthetic data generation. This paper not only presents a comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data but also illustrates its potential in mitigating privacy concerns within the field of LA, thus contributing to a wider application of synthetic data in LA and promoting a better practice for open science.},

abstract = {With the growing significance of data analysis, several studies aim to provide precise answers to users' natural language questions from tables, a task referred to as tabular question answering (TQA). The state-of-the-art TQA approaches are limited to handling only single-table questions. However, real-world TQA problems are inherently complex and frequently involve multiple tables, which poses challenges in directly extending single-table TQA designs to handle multiple tables, primarily due to the limited extensibility of the majority of single-table TQA methods.This paper proposes AutoTQA, a novel Autonomous Tabular Question Answering framework that employs multi-agent large language models (LLMs) across multiple tables from various systems (e.g., TiDB, BigQuery). AutoTQA comprises five agents: the User, responsible for receiving the user's natural language inquiry; the Planner, tasked with creating an execution plan for the user's inquiry; the Engineer, responsible for executing the plan step-by-step; the Executor, provides various execution environments (e.g., text-to-SQL) to fulfill specific tasks assigned by the Engineer; and the Critic, responsible for judging whether to complete the user's natural language inquiry and identifying gaps between the current results and initial tasks. To facilitate the interaction between different agents, we have also devised agent scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, we have developed LinguFlow, an open-source, low-code visual programming tool, to quickly build and debug LLM-based applications, and to accelerate the creation of various external tools and execution environments. We also implemented a series of data connectors, which allows AutoTQA to access various tables from multiple systems. Extensive experiments show that AutoTQA delivers outstanding performance on four representative datasets.},

abstract = {Standards form an important basis for the manufacture of high-quality and safe products. As the standards landscape becomes more complex over time, the mandatory interpretation is becoming increasingly challenging and knowledge gained from experience in dealing with the standards plays a key role. This paper uses welding—as a manufacturing process that is highly regulated by standards—to demonstrate the possibilities that large language models (LLMs) offer to assist people and shows how knowledge management can be supported in applying these standards. Therefore, a chatbot prototype specialising in the specific requirements of welding standards was developed and evaluated on the methodological framework of a design case study. The results show that LLMs have the potential to improve access to complex standards beyond simple databases and document searches and facilitate compliance with these requirements. However, there are certain limitations regarding normative language and the need for referencing.},

abstract = {Performance artforms like Peking opera face transmission challenges due to the extensive passive listening required to understand their nuance. To create engaging forms of experiencing auditory Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), we designed a spatial interaction-based segmented-audio (SISA) Virtual Reality system that transforms passive ICH experiences into active ones. We undertook: (1) a co-design workshop with seven stakeholders to establish design requirements, (2) prototyping with five participants to validate design elements, and (3) user testing with 16 participants exploring Peking Opera. We designed transformations of temporal music into spatial interactions by cutting sounds into short audio segments, applying t-SNE algorithm to cluster audio segments spatially. Users navigate through these sounds by their similarity in audio property. Analysis revealed two distinct interaction patterns (Progressive and Adaptive), and demonstrated SISA’s efficacy in facilitating active auditory ICH engagement. Our work illuminates the design process for enriching traditional performance artform using spatially-tuned forms of listening.},

This violence is characterized by intricate dynamics surrounding voice, identities, bodies, and social interactions. To comprehend and provide a theoretical framework for this enduring phenomenon of digital violence, the present research introduces the concept of Trans Cyber-Necropolitics (TCN). TCN is a necropolitical system that explains how digital media enforce the disposability of trans people in cyberspace. We decompose this digital death into three steps: sensing, targeting, and invisible killing. Combining with the authors’ positionality as transgender gamers, we provide a critical analysis of how each step operates, conducted via a meticulous examination of games, as well as an exploration of the discourse from game design and community-side comments through the lens of critical discourse analysis. Building on this analysis, we ideate how each step could be disrupted with resistance strategies and technological measures.},

We find that they want to use ChatGPT for SE tasks like software library selection but often worry about the truthfulness of ChatGPT responses. We developed a suite of techniques and a tool called CID (ChatGPT Incorrectness Detector) to automatically test and detect the incorrectness in ChatGPT responses. CID is based on the iterative prompting to ChatGPT by asking it contextually similar but textually divergent questions (using an approach that utilizes metamorphic relationships in texts). The underlying principle in CID is that for a given question, a response that is different from other responses (across multiple incarnations of the question) is likely an incorrect response. In a benchmark study of library selection, we show that CID can detect incorrect responses from ChatGPT with an F1-score of 0.74 -- 0.75.},

Studies in software development have explored the adoption of these tools, investigating their characteristics and impacts and how practitioners interact and perceive them. To contribute to this growing body of knowledge, in this study, we aim to explore the adoption of AI-based programming assistants in the Brazilian industry. More specifically, we aim to understand how practitioners of a particular Brazilian agroindustry-related company perceive and use AI-based tools to develop software. Using an online survey, we collected and analyzed 72 responses from employees of the studied company. Our findings suggest that practitioners mainly adopt ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, interacting with these tools to accelerate online searching, typing, and syntax recall. A recurrent difficulty is the lack of context in the suggestions provided by these tools, but participants work on detailed descriptions to contextualize and cope with this challenge. Among the reasons for not using AI-based tools, the most influential is that participants use a commercial programming language, i.e., Uniface, which these tools lack examples. Our results provide insights into the state of the practice related to AI-based programming assistants and discuss implications for practitioners and researchers.},

abstract = {Biometric systems are widely used for authentication and identification. The False Match Rate (FMR) quantifies the probability of matching a biometric template to a non-corresponding template and serves as an indicator of the system robustness against security threats. We analyze biometric systems through two main contributions. First, we study untargeted attacks, where an adversary aims to impersonate any user in the database. We compute the number of trials needed for a successful impersonation and derive the critical population size ( i.e., the maximum database size) and critical (FMR) required to maintain security against untargeted attacks as the database grows. Second, we address the biometric birthday problem, which quantifies the probability that there exists two distinct users that collide ( i.e., can impersonate each other). We compute approximate and exact probabilities of collision and derive the associated critical population size and critical (FMR) to bound the risk of biometric collisions, particularly in large-scale databases. These thresholds provide actionable insights for designing biometric systems that mitigate the risks of impersonation and biometric collisions, particularly in large-scale databases. Nevertheless, our findings show that current systems fail to meet the required security level against untargeted attacks, even in small databases, and face significant challenges with the biometric birthday problem as databases grow.},

We assume that they will share sidewalks, foot, and cycle paths with vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrians and cyclists) rather than sharing the road with cars. To ensure a safe and peaceful coexistence of robots and human users, an open question is to what extent and how such robots should interact with sidewalk users. In this paper, we extend the body of research in this field 1) by creating a classification of situations where interaction is expected to happen, 2) by designing proposals for robot user interfaces, and 3) by reporting results from a user study in which we evaluated the different interfaces. Our results show that a combination of different interface aspects performs best with regard to usability and user experience.},

abstract = {In an era of growing water demand and amplifying climatic disruptions, water is an increasingly limited and precious resource. As datacenters continue to proliferate due in particular to growing artificial intelligence demand, datacenter reliance on water for cooling is drawing increasing criticism. In this paper, we investigate the water and energy consumption, carbon emissions, and cost associated with the energy demand (including its cooling) from a datacenter, in four diverse locations (California, Texas, Germany, and France). We consider water use both in evaporative cooling and power generation, employing a hybrid datacenter cooling model that is operable with and without evaporative cooling. Subsequently, we examine solutions that expand the equipment’s operational range and actively exploit the cooling design redundancy. Moreover, we investigate the benefits of making datacenters dynamic, that is changing operating balance hourly. The results show that using dry cooling in California reduces the water average consumption by 4.34 million of gallon per month with minimal increase in TCO (0.7\%). However in France, water saving increases TCO by up to 3.9x more than in California. The story for carbon emissions is more complicated, dry cooling increases total carbon emissions in some geographies (California, Texas), but has minimal impact in others (France). Operating cooling equipment more aggressively enables wider datacenter operation ranges and the reduction of carbon emissions by 1.36\%. This approach also improves the PUE of dry cooling and can produce lower TCO in the future.},

This paper explores the effects of exposure to AI-generated images on measures of design fixation and divergent thinking in a visual ideation task. Through a between-participants experiment (N=60), we found that support from an AI image generator during ideation leads to higher fixation on an initial example. Participants who used AI produced fewer ideas, with less variety and lower originality compared to a baseline. Our qualitative analysis suggests that the effectiveness of co-ideation with AI rests on participants’ chosen approach to prompt creation and on the strategies used by participants to generate ideas in response to the AI’s suggestions. We discuss opportunities for designing generative AI systems for ideation support and incorporating these AI tools into ideation workflows.},

Combining automated and human methods, we investigate this issue in multiple dimensions quantificationally and conduct a set of evaluations on three prevailing T2I models (DALL-E v2, Stable Diffusion v1.5 and v2.1). Introducing attributes of cultural cluster and subject, we provide a fresh interdisciplinary perspective to bias analysis. The benchmark dataset UCOGC is presented, which encompasses authentic images of unique cultural objects from global clusters. Our results reveal that the culture of a disadvantaged country is prone to be neglected, some specified subjects often present a stereotype or a simple patchwork of elements, and over half of cultural objects are mispresented.},

In this paper, we conducted a diffractive analysis exploring the potential role of prompt-based interfaces in artists’ creative practice. Over a two week period, seven visual artists were given access to a personalised instance of Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned on a dataset of their work. In the following diffractive analysis, we identified two dominant modes adopted by participants, AI for ideation, and AI for production. We furthermore present a number of ethical design considerations for the future development of generative AI interfaces.},

In this paper, we provide such understanding by reporting on 25 interviews with practitioners who handle data in three distinct development stages of different LLMs. Our contributions are (1) empirical evidence of how uncertainty, data practices, and reliance mechanisms change across LLMs’ development cycle; (2) how the unique qualities of LLMs impact data practices and their implications for the future of Gen AI technologies; and (3) provide three opportunities for HCI researchers interested in supporting practitioners developing Gen AI technologies.},

We recruited 20 participants, asking them to use ChatGPT to generate functionalities (product overview or checkout) and then modify these using neutral prompts to meet a business goal (e.g., “increase the likelihood of us selling our product”). We found that all 20 generated websites contained at least one DD pattern (mean: 5, max: 9), with GPT-4 providing no warnings. When reflecting on the designs, only 4 participants expressed concerns, while most considered the outcomes satisfactory and not morally problematic, despite the potential ethical and legal implications for end-users and those adopting ChatGPT’s recommendations.},

Our close reading of the films and filmmakers’ reflections on their processes reveal four critical approaches to negotiating AI use in filmmaking: minimization, maximization, compartmentalization, and revitalization. We discuss how these approaches suggest the potential for underground filmmaking cultures to form around AI with critical amateurs reclaiming social control over the creative possibilities.},

Owing to such a vast diversity, a single sentence can only correctly describe a portion of the video. Dense Video Captioning (DVC) aims to detect and describe different events in a given video. The term DVC originated in the 2017 ActivityNet challenge, after which considerable effort has been made to address the challenge. DVC is divided into three sub-tasks: (1) Video Feature Extraction, (2) Temporal Event Localization, and (3) Dense Caption Generation. In this survey, we discuss all of the studies that claim to perform DVC along with its sub-tasks and summarize their results. We also discuss all of the datasets that have been used for DVC. Last, current challenges in the field are highlighted along with observatory remarks and future trends in the field.},

abstract = {Unit testing plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, as it ensures code quality. However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement CITYWALK by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o. The experimental results show that CITYWALK outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on a collection of ten popular C++ projects. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CITYWALK in generating high-quality C++ unit tests.},

With AIGC, it can be effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively. Finally, we show some representative benchmarks, present a statistical analysis, and summarize the potential exploration directions from each of these properties.},

As GAI evolves, creatives must consider how (or how not) to incorporate these tools into their practices. In this paper, we present interviews at the intersection of these applications. We learned from 10 creatives with disabilities who intentionally use and do not use GAI in and around their creative work. Their mediums ranged from audio engineering to leatherwork, and they collectively experienced a variety of disabilities, from sensory to motor to invisible disabilities. We share cross-cutting themes of their access hacks, how creative practice and access work become entangled, and their perspectives on how GAI should and should not fit into their workflows. In turn, we offer qualities of accessible creativity with responsible AI that can inform future research.},

Although systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) were designed to simplify the email replying process, users still need to provide detailed prompts to obtain the expected output. Therefore, we propose and evaluate an LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email. We developed a prototype system, ResQ, and conducted controlled and field experiments with 12 and 8 participants. Our results demonstrated that the QA-based approach improves the efficiency of replying to emails and reduces workload while maintaining email quality, compared to a conventional prompt-based approach that requires users to craft appropriate prompts to obtain email drafts. We discuss how the QA-based approach influences the email reply process and interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with using a QA-based approach in AI-mediated communication.},

Human, societal, and environmental values, alongside traditional software quality, are increasingly recognized as essential for sustainability and long-term well-being. Traditionally, systems are engineered taking into account business goals and technology drivers. Considering the growing awareness in the community, in this article, we argue that engineering of systems should also consider human, societal, and environmental drivers. Then, we identify the macro and technological challenges by focusing on humans and their role while co-existing with digital systems. The first challenge considers humans in a proactive role when interacting with digital systems, i.e., taking initiative in making things happen instead of reacting to events. The second concerns humans having a reactive role in interacting with digital systems, i.e., humans interacting with digital systems as a reaction to events. The third challenge focuses on humans with a passive role, i.e., they experience, enjoy or even suffer the decisions and/or actions of digital systems. The fourth challenge concerns the duality of trust and trustworthiness, with humans playing any role. Building on the new human, societal, and environmental drivers and the macro and technological challenges, we identify a research roadmap of digital systems for humanity. The research roadmap is concretized in a number of research directions organized into four groups: development process, requirements engineering, software architecture and design, and verification and validation.},

In this paper, we compare and summarize these algorithms with a driven information-based taxonomy. We systematically conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 mainstream data repair algorithms on 12 datasets under the settings of various data error rates, error types, and 4 downstream analysis tasks, assessing their error reduction performance with a novel but practical metric. We develop an effective and unified repair optimization strategy that substantially benefits the state of the arts. We conclude that, it is always worthy of data repair. The clean data does not determine the upper bound of data analysis performance. We provide valuable guidelines, challenges, and promising directions in the data repair domain.

abstract = {Context. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) promotes the use of high-level models to enhance and streamline the development process. These models are often defined using a domain-specific modeling language (DSL). Defining a DSL begins with identifying key domain concepts and the relationships between them. These concepts and relationships are generally represented through a meta-model. In this context, the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) is widely recognized as the de facto standard for meta-modeling, and it is among the most popular choices in the open-source modeling community. EMF provides Ecore, an object-oriented-based language used to define meta-models.Problem statement. Previous studies have observed significant Ecore meta-model duplication in the open-source ecosystem. While it is well known that engineers frequently copy and paste meta-models, the motivations behind this practice and its potential drawbacks remain uncertain.Contribution. This paper explores the phenomenon of meta-model duplication within the open-source ecosystem by addressing the following research question: how and why does meta-model duplication occur?Study design. Using a popular dataset of 30k meta-models extracted from GitHub, we analyze and quantify meta-model duplication at two levels: (1) intra-repository duplication, where a developer replicates the same or similar meta-models multiple times within a single repository, and (2) inter-repository duplication, which occurs when meta-models are reused across different repositories. Additionally, we examine representative samples of repositories exhibiting both types of duplication and apply an open-coding strategy to identify and analyze the underlying reasons behind each.Results. Our findings align with previous research, confirming the widespread occurrence of meta-model duplication on GitHub. Regarding intra-repository duplication, 21.84\% of the analyzed repositories exhibit this pattern. Key factors contributing to this duplication include testing and benchmarking of modeling tools, duplication inherent in the underlying modeling technology, tutorials and assignments, coexistence of multiple meta-model versions, and various questionable practices in intra-project dependency and Git version management. Inter-repository duplication is even more prevalent, with 49.04\% of repositories containing meta-models sourced from other repositories. The primary reasons for this type of duplication include repository duplication, meta-model reuse within the main tooling, testing and benchmarking, tutorials and assignments, and zoo/dataset repositories. Finally, we observe that when engineers reuse a meta-model, they make only a few modifications, which are typically simple—primarily involving the addition or removal of instances of the core building blocks of the Ecore meta-modeling language (EAttributes, EReferences, and EClasses). Based on these findings, we examine certain engineering practices that lead to meta-model duplication, potentially hindering modeling projects, and propose strategies to mitigate these issues. Additionally, we explore cases where duplication does not have negative consequences, as well as instances where it arises due to the limitations of current modeling tools.},

Through a qualitative study using ethnographic interviews and participatory observation, this paper explores how GAI impacted the workflows, creative processes, and professional identities of early career game developers. We present a case of GAI integration that was not a straightforward adoption. Focusing on the interns’ resistance, negotiation, and reimagining, we show that the interns were actively developing a new professional culture both with and against generative AI. For the interns, their ethical commitments to fellow game developers and the future of their profession were as important as their practical concerns about usability, utility, and efficacy of GAI tools.},

While CUIs introduce novel benefits, they also yield risks that may exploit people’s trust. Although research looking at unethical design deployed through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) established a thorough understanding of so-called dark patterns, there is a need to continue this discourse within the CUI community to understand potentially problematic interactions. Addressing this gap, we interviewed 27 participants from three cohorts: researchers, practitioners, and frequent users of CUIs. Applying thematic analysis, we construct five themes reflecting each cohort’s insights about ethical design challenges and introduce the CUI Expectation Cycle, bridging system capabilities and user expectations while considering each theme’s ethical caveats. This research aims to inform future development of CUIs to consider ethical constraints while adopting a human-centred approach.},

abstract = {Active Directory (AD) is the default security management system for Windows domain networks. An AD environment can be described as a cyber-attack graph, with nodes representing computers, accounts, and so forth, and edges indicating existing accesses or known exploits that enable attackers to move from one node to another. This article explores a Stackelberg game model between one attacker and one defender on an AD attack graph. The attacker’s goal is to maximize their chances of successfully reaching the destination before getting detected. The defender’s aim is to block a constant number of edges to minimize the attacker’s chance of success. The article shows that the problem is #P-hard and, therefore, intractable to solve exactly. To defend the AD graph from cyberattackers, this article proposes two defensive approaches. In the first approach, we convert the attacker’s problem to an exponential-sized Dynamic Program that is approximated by a neural network (NN). Once trained, the NN serves as an efficient fitness function for defender’s Evolutionary Diversity Optimization-based defensive policy. The diversity emphasis on the defender’s solution provides a diverse set of training samples, improving the training accuracy of our NN for modeling the attacker. In the second approach, we propose a RL-based policy to solve the attacker’s problem and Critic network-assisted Evolutionary Diversity Optimization-based defensive policy to solve defender’s problem. Experimental results on synthetic AD graphs show that the proposed defensive policies are scalable, highly effective, approximate attacker’s problem accurately and generate good defensive plans.},

abstract = {Providing sequential recommendations along with easily comprehensible natural language explanations can significantly enhance users’ trust in the recommender systems. However, this approach presents two key challenges: (1) The different objectives of the two tasks make it challenging to achieve joint optimization and mutual enhancement. (2) The simultaneous generation of accurate sequential recommendations and high-quality natural language explanations presents serious challenges to the model’s time and space efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-task self-prompt framework for explainable sequential recommendation (ARTS), which improves collaboration performance and time and space efficiency of multi-task modules based on the generated personalized semantic prompts. Specifically, we propose a self-prompt generator that transfers the user’s global behavior features into the continuous prompt, achieving efficient information sharing among multi-task modules. Additionally, we design a personalized prompt-based short sequence inputs strategy under the pre-training and prompt-tuning paradigm, which achieves mutual enhancement among the multi-task modules and significantly improves the model’s time and space efficiency. Extensive experiments have verified that the proposed ARTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both sequential recommendation and explanation generation tasks. The generality, efficiency and effectiveness of each module of the framework have also been validated through various experiments1.},

However, current practices present challenges: clients often lack guidance for completing tasks that combine art-making and verbal expression, while therapists find it difficult to track and tailor homework. How HCI systems might support art therapy homework remains underexplored. To address this, we present TherAlssist, comprising a chent-facing application leveraging human-Al co-creative art-making and conversational agents to facilitate homework, and a therapist-facing application enabling customization of homework agents and Al-compiled homework history. A 30-day field study with 24 clients and 5 therapists showed how TherAlssist supported clients' homework and reflection in their everyday settings. Results also revealed how therapists infused their practice principles and personal touch into the agents to offer tailored homework, and how Al-compiled homework history became a meaningful resource for in-session interactions. Implications for designing human-Al systems to facilitate asynchronous client-practitioner collaboration are discussed.},

The challenge includes but is not limited to, legal and practical issues of human involvement in HCI research. This Grand Challenge demands studies and advances with implications for HCI in the normative, applied and meta-scientific fields of Computer Ethics. The role of HCI is to promote debate and transform Computing, as a science and application, and to inform society on issues involving computational technologies, their consequences for human beings and other forms of life. This Grand Challenge points out that the HCI area must inform society and transfer the results of research, as one of the fundamental ethical aspects of the beneficence of participants. In this way, ethical and responsible research in HCI must reverberate in actions that direct scientific and technological development, the definition of public and regulatory policies, and their alignment with universal human rights and the constitution of more just and democratic societies.

abstract = {Motivated by an imperative to reduce the carbon emissions of cloud data centers, this paper studies the online carbon-aware resource scaling problem with unknown job lengths (OCSU) and applies it to carbon-aware resource scaling for executing computing workloads. The task is to dynamically scale resources (e.g., the number of servers) assigned to a job of unknown length such that it is completed before a deadline, with the objective of reducing the carbon emissions of executing the workload. The total carbon emissions of executing a job originate from the emissions of running the job and excess carbon emitted while switching between different scales (e.g., due to checkpoint and resume). Prior work on carbon-aware resource scaling has assumed accurate job length information, while other approaches have ignored switching losses and require carbon intensity forecasts. These assumptions prohibit the practical deployment of prior work for online carbon-aware execution of scalable computing workload. We propose LACS, a theoretically robust, learning-augmented algorithm that solves OCSU. To achieve improved practical average-case performance, LACS integrates machine-learned predictions of job length. To achieve solid theoretical performance, LACS extends the recent theoretical advances on online conversion with switching costs to handle a scenario where the job length is unknown. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that, on average, the carbon footprint of LACS lies within 1.2\% of the online baseline that assumes perfect job length information and within 16\% of the offline baseline that, in addition to the job length, also requires accurate carbon intensity forecasts. Furthermore, LACS achieves a 32\% reduction in carbon footprint compared to the deadline-aware carbon-agnostic execution of the job.},

We witness an increasingly pervasive use of such models in various computational tasks. In some preliminary works, attempts to integrate Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be identified, in particular, to perform the classic tasks related to the construction of Knowledge Graphs through semantic annotation of texts. Nowadays, tables are widely used and play a crucial role in creating, organising, and sharing information that could be used to produce factual knowledge to be integrated into a Knowledge Graph. However, table-to-KG techniques through LLM have not been extensively investigated. This paper presents stEELlm, an innovative Semantic Table Interpretation approach obtained by fine-tuning the Mixtral 8x7B model. Conducted experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our model to successfully create semantic annotations of heterogeneous datasets, a scenario where classic approaches based on heuristics tend to fail.},

We first analyzed the traditional scale development process to identify tasks suitable for LLM integration, including both human-in-the-loop and automated LLM data collection methods. Following this analysis, we developed the details of BRASS Bot, incorporating design principles of falsifiability and reproducibility. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the BRASS Bot across a diverse set of LLMs, including GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, to assess its usability, validity, and reliability. We further demonstrated the practical utility of the BRASS Bot by conducting a user study and a predictive validity simulation. Our research presents both theoretical and practical implications. The augmentation approach of the BRASS Bot enriches the theoretical foundations of behavioral constructs by identifying previously overlooked patterns. Additionally, the BRASS Bot offers significant time and resource efficiency gains while enhancing scale validity. Our work lays the foundation for future research on the broader application of LLMs as both assistants and collaborators in survey analysis and behavioral research design and execution, highlighting their potential for a transformative impact on the field.},

Particularly in the United States, platforms are not subject to legal constraints prescribing permissible content. Each platform has thus developed bespoke content moderation policies, but there is little work towards a comparative understanding of these policies across platforms and topics. This paper presents the first systematic study of these policies from the 43 largest online platforms hosting user-generated content, focusing on policies around copyright infringement, harmful speech, and misleading content. We build a custom web-scraper to obtain policy text and develop a unified annotation scheme to analyze the text for the presence of critical components. We find significant structural and compositional variation in policies across topics and platforms, with some variation attributable to disparate legal groundings. We lay the groundwork for future studies of ever-evolving content moderation policies and their impact on users.},

However, there are also concerns about accuracy and trustworthiness of self-care advice provided via AI. This paper reports our findings from workshops, diaries, and interviews with five researchers and 24 participants to explore their experiences and use of generative AI for self-care. We analyze our findings to present a framework for the use of generative AI to support five types of self-care, – advice seeking, mentorship, resource creation, social simulation, and therapeutic self-expression – mapped across two dimensions – expertise and modality. We discuss how these practices shift the role of technologies for self-care from merely offering information to offering personalized advice and supporting creativity for reflection, and we offer suggestions for using the framework to investigate new self-care designs.},

abstract = {We are witnessing a rapid global roll-out of generative AI (genAI) and facial processing technologies (FPT). How these technologies impact societies also depends on local-specific factors that are rarely investigated or considered in their development or roll-out. To address public concerns and promote observed benefits, various institutions and governments are actively working on new regulations. In light of these developments, we conducted two questionnaire studies: one with policymakers and advisors (N = 61) and another with laypeople (N = 1070) of twelve nationalities, including Nigeria, South Africa, India, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the UK, the US, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Brazil. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses, our research explores (1) the topics related to genAI and FPT that policymakers seek laypeople’s opinions on, (2) laypeople’s perceptions of these technologies, and (3) comparisons of identified topics to highlight relevant issues for public discussion. We find that both AI technologies are adopted differently by laypeople respondents from different countries. The topics on which policymakers want to hear the opinions of laypeople overlap largely with laypeople’s concerns and topics they deem necessary to be further discussed. However, they differ in the level of technological depth. Overall, most respondents in both surveyed groups support regulation rather than an outright ban on AI technologies. This highlights the need for in-depth discursive formats to inform those regulatory efforts, but also to question prevailing narratives around both technologies’ capacities.},

abstract = {Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) is a style of narrative-based Virtual Reality (VR) experience built on filmed or computer-generated 360-degree videos. Since CVR is becoming more popular and widely accessible, researchers and practitioners have been trying to address challenges such as the conflict between the viewer’s freedom of choice and the creator’s control over where to look, or the risk of missing key story elements due to such freedom. As part of the solution, CVR creators employ attention-guiding cues, introduce viewer interaction, and combine these two techniques into all-encompassing CVR production frameworks. However, there are very few CVR projects that embrace the various differences in the backgrounds, preferences, and expectations of each individual viewer. Further to this, they do not consider the content creator/owners’ perspective when presenting and digitizing stories from the real world, especially when considering viewer’s connection to the cultural significance contained. In this article, a case study is presented to explore the use of adaptability to viewer situations and the coherence to Mundefinedori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) storytelling contexts in CVR experiences. In the case study, we began with co-design sessions with storytellers from Te Rau Aroha Marae (an active Mundefinedori cultural heritage site in the deep south of New Zealand), about appropriate features to collect from visitors to a virtual storytelling event, then co-built personas as representative tools. 360-degree videos of p\={u}rundefinedkau (stories) were then captured and presented via an adaptable VR system. Evaluations were conducted with the storytellers to validate the system and to collect reflections and opinions on both the use of CVR in Mundefinedori storytelling and the cultural appropriateness of CVR with adaptability. We conclude this article with a discussion of possible improvements for future CVR frameworks.},

Synthesizing comic studies, we create a design space describing how to use comic elements (e.g., onomatopoeia) to depict non-visual sensations (e.g., hearing). To demonstrate this design space, we built eight demos, such as speed lines to make a user think they are faster and smell lines to make a scent seem stronger. We evaluate these elements in a qualitative user study (N=20) where participants performed everyday tasks with comic elements added as augmentations. All participants stated feeling a change in perception for at least one sensation, with perceived changes detected by between four participants (touch) and 15 participants (hearing). The elements also had positive effects on emotion and user experience, even when participants did not feel changes in perception.},

Many researchers have been devoted to synthesizing high-fidelity human images as one of the most commonly seen object categories in daily lives, where a large number of studies are performed based on various models, task settings, and applications. Thus, it is necessary to give a comprehensive overview on these variant methods on human image generation. In this article, we divide human image generation techniques into three paradigms, i.e., data-driven methods, knowledge-guided methods, and hybrid methods. For each paradigm, the most representative models and the corresponding variants are presented, where the advantages and characteristics of different methods are summarized in terms of model architectures. The main public human image datasets and evaluation metrics in the literature are also summarized. Furthermore, due to the wide application potential, the typical downstream usages of synthesized human images are covered. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities of human image generation are discussed to shed light on future research.},

abstract = {Computing graduates are frequently reported by members of industry to lack in professional dispositions and/or non-technical skills (often referred to as "soft skills"). In this work, we conduct a gap analysis of the alignment between academic preparation and industry expectations through a three-pronged study. First, a literature review explored the academic perspective of how fostering professional dispositions and non-technical skills occurs in tertiary computing education. Second, a literature review identifying industry's expectations of those dispositions and skills for entry-level computing professionals. Finally, a mixed-methods approach, combining a survey and structured interviews of computing industry professionals to identify their opinions on the relative importance of those skills and dispositions. In each of these prongs, we additionally consider whether and how Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) may have been approached and/or incorporated.Our work uncovers a number of gaps. Several skills and dispositions, such as leadership, ethics, and inventiveness, are over-represented in the academic literature compared to industry's expectations, while others such as lifelong learning and professionalism are under-emphasised. Furthermore, some terms such as 'ethics' and 'professionalism' are defined differently by various stakeholder groups, leading to a gap between academic training and industry expectations. Finally, several skills and dispositions, such as collaboration, teamwork, communication, and leadership show evidence of exposure in academia, but require more scaffolded instruction to meet industry expectations. We also found a dearth of coverage in the literature and a lack of focus in industry for DEIA considerations.},

Drawing from literature in HCI, craft studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), we explore craft's modern formation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution across three formative sites: Scandinavian Sl\"{o}yd, British Arts and Crafts, and Japanese Mingei. From this review we identify three key (and still evolving) features: craft's accountabilities to natural materials and local ecologies; craft's holistic ways of making with 'head, heart, and hand'; and craft's distinctly collaborative and embodied styles of teaching and learning. We then show how these lessons can be applied to contemporary practices and pedagogies of computational making. We argue that doing so can help to rebalance computation's ecological ties and relations, recenter its practice on a sensorially rich and 'whole-self' concept of making, and support more collaborative modes of teaching and learning that are inclusive, relational, and heterogeneous.},

abstract = {Indie game developers are often defined as game developers who are typically not employed by or affiliated with tech giants or large gaming companies/publishers. Although people may decide to "go indie" for various purposes, indie game development has become a crucial part of the global gaming culture. However, this community is now facing unprecedented tensions as generative AI technologies are shifting how games can be designed, produced, and experienced. Through a qualitative analysis of 3,091 online posts and comments from subreddits and Facebook groups for indie game developers, we offer an in-depth investigation of how indie game developers perceive and envision the multifaceted role of generative AI in their creative practices. Our empirical investigation reveals that generative AI both promotes and harms indie game developers' endeavors to innovate the traditional game production model, which further influences the nature and workflow of creativity in game development. We also propose three principles for designing future generative AI technologies to improve indie developers' work while mitigating potential risks, harm, and negative impacts of AI. We hope that this study can help design and develop future generative AI technologies to foster and sustain more democratic and inclusive practices in game development rather than replacing human creators.},

We conducted an experiment based upon regression analysis on user interaction logs from three user study datasets which in total encompass 24 topics, 841 unique search sessions, and 2,685 queries. The findings indicate that decoys significantly increase the likelihood of document clicks and perceived usefulness. To investigate whether the influence of the decoy varies across different levels of task difficulty and user knowledge, we ran an additional experiment on one of the three datasets, which encompasses 6 topics, 166 search sessions and 652 queries. The results indicate that when the task is less challenging, users are more likely to click on a document with a decoy. Additionally, they spend more time on the target document and assign it a higher usefulness score. Furthermore, users with lower knowledge levels about the topic tend to give higher usefulness ratings to the target document.Regarding IR system evaluation, this study provides empirical insights into measuring the vulnerability of text retrieval models to potential decoy effect. An evaluation metric, namely DEcoy Judgement and Assessment VUlnerability (DEJA-VU), is proposed to evaluate the possibility of a retrieval model ranking results in a way that could trigger decoy biases. The experiments on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 19 Deep Learning (DL) passage retrieval task and the TREC 20 DL passage retrieval task demonstrate that ColBERT and SPLADE show higher relevance-oriented retrieval effectiveness while also displaying lower vulnerability to decoy effect.Overall, this work advances the understanding of decoy effect, a well-established concept in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, in a novel application field (i.e., Information Retrieval). It contributes to modeling users’ search behavior in the context of cognitive biases, as well as assessment of the vulnerability of systems and ranking algorithms to the decoy effect.},

abstract = {Providing asynchronous feedback is a critical step in the 3D design workflow. A common approach to providing feedback is to pair textual comments with companion reference images, which helps illustrate the gist of text. Ideally, feedback providers should possess 3D and image editing skills to create reference images that can effectively describe what they have in mind. However, they often lack such skills, so they have to resort to sketches or online images that might not match well with the current 3D design. To address this, we introduce MemoVis, a text editor interface that assists feedback providers in creating reference images with generative AI driven by the feedback comments. First, a novel real-time viewpoint suggestion feature, based on a vision-language foundation model, helps feedback providers anchor a comment with a camera viewpoint. Second, given a camera viewpoint, we introduce three types of image modifiers based on pre-trained 2D generative models to turn a text comment into an updated version of the 3D scene from that viewpoint. We conducted a within-subjects study with  (14) feedback providers, demonstrating the effectiveness of MemoVis. The quality and explicitness of the companion images were evaluated by another eight participants with prior 3D design experience.},

abstract = {Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance. Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs. However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor. Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage. To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH. Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches. Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs. We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.},

We argue that metacognition—the psychological ability to monitor and control one’s thoughts and behavior—offers a valuable lens to understand and design for these usability challenges. Drawing on research in psychology and cognitive science, and recent GenAI user studies, we illustrate how GenAI systems impose metacognitive demands on users, requiring a high degree of metacognitive monitoring and control. We propose these demands could be addressed by integrating metacognitive support strategies into GenAI systems, and by designing GenAI systems to reduce their metacognitive demand by targeting explainability and customizability. Metacognition offers a coherent framework for understanding the usability challenges posed by GenAI, and provides novel research and design directions to advance human-AI interaction.},

Then, 425 new participants rated the 147 personality descriptors in an online survey. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the collected descriptors and show that, though overlapping, human personality models do not fully transfer to the chatbot's personality as perceived by humans. We also show that the perceived personality is significantly different from that of virtual personal assistants, where users focus rather on serviceability and functionality. We discuss the implications of ever-evolving large language models and the change they affect in users' perception of agent personalities.},

abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) have a longstanding tradition of interrogating the values that underlie systems in order to create novel and accessible experiences. In this work, we use a neurodiversity framing to examine how people with ways of thinking, speaking, and being that differ from normative assumptions are perceived by researchers seeking to study and design social computing systems for neurodivergent people. From a critical analysis of 84 publications systematically gathered across a decade of social computing research, we determine that research into social computing with neurodiverse participants is largely medicalized, adheres to historical stereotypes of neurodivergent children and their families, and is insensitive to the wide spectrum of neurodivergent people that are potential users of social technologies. When social computing systems designed for neurodivergent people rely upon a conception of disability that restricts expression for the sake of preserving existing norms surrounding social experience, the result is often simplistic and restrictive systems that prevent users from "being social" in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. We argue that a neurodiversity perspective informed by critical disability theory allows us to engage with alternative forms of sociality as meaningful and desirable rather than a deficit to be compensated for. We conclude by identifying opportunities for researchers to collaborate with neurodivergent users and their communities, including the creation of spectrum-conscious social systems and the embedding of double empathy into systems for more equitable design.},

abstract = {Recent advances in generative AI technologies like large language models raise both excitement and concerns about the future of human-AI co-creation in writing. To unpack people’s attitude towards and experience with generative AI-powered writing assistants, in this paper, we conduct an experiment to understand whether and how much value people attach to AI assistance, and how the incorporation of AI assistance in writing workflows changes people’s writing perceptions and performance. Our results suggest that people are willing to forgo financial payments to receive writing assistance from AI, especially if AI can provide direct content generation assistance and the writing task is highly creative. Generative AI-powered assistance is found to offer benefits in increasing people’s productivity and confidence in writing. However, direct content generation assistance offered by AI also comes with risks, including decreasing people’s sense of accountability and diversity in writing. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.},

abstract = {The threatening environmental problems of our time challenge the notion that humans are separate from and dominant over nature. As a result, many studies in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) address alternatives to human-centered design and explore post-anthropocentric approaches that decenter humans and consider nature in technology design. The question, however, is how to design post-anthropocentric technology that engages humans and nature. Based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and analyzed 53 papers, from which we extracted 114 post-anthropocentric artifacts that enable human–nature engagement. We identified seven design strategies, such as recognizing, exploring, and empowering that can guide the future design of post-anthropocentric artifacts. Most of the artifacts included support human agency, fewer support nature’s agency, or advocate for nature to achieve an equitable human–nature relation. We identified opportunities for the field, such as empowering nature and further exploring the implications of post-anthropocentric design for addressing environmental problems.},

abstract = {Game modding offers unique and personalized gaming experiences, but the technical complexity of creating mods often limits participation to skilled users. We envision a future where every player can create personalized mods for their games. To explore this space, we designed StarCharM, a GenAI-based non-player character (NPC) creator for Stardew Valley. Our tool enables players to iteratively create new NPC mods, requiring minimal user input while allowing for fine-grained adjustments through user control. We conducted a user study with ten Stardew Valley players who had varied mod usage experiences to understand the impacts of StarCharM and provide insights into how GenAI tools may reshape modding, particularly in NPC creation. Participants expressed excitement in bringing their character ideas to life, although they noted challenges in generating rich content to fulfill complex visions. While they believed GenAI tools like StarCharM can foster a more diverse modding community, some voiced concerns about diminished originality and community engagement that may come with such technology. Our findings provided implications and guidelines for the future of GenAI-powered modding tools and co-creative modding practices.},

abstract = {Affectively driven algorithmic composition (AAC) is a rapidly growing field that exploits computer-aided composition in order to generate new music with particular emotional qualities or affective intentions. An AAC system was devised in order to generate a stimulus set covering nine discrete sectors of a two-dimensional emotion space by means of a 16-channel feed-forward artificial neural network. This system was used to generate a stimulus set of short pieces of music, which were rendered using a sampled piano timbre and evaluated by a group of experienced listeners who ascribed a two-dimensional valence-arousal coordinate to each stimulus. The underlying musical feature set, initially drawn from the literature, was subsequently adjusted by amplifying or attenuating the quantity of each feature in order to maximize the spread of stimuli in the valence-arousal space before a second listener evaluation was conducted. This process was repeated a third time in order to maximize the spread of valence-arousal coordinates ascribed to the generated stimulus set in comparison to a spread taken from an existing prerated database of stimuli, demonstrating that this prototype AAC system is capable of creating short sequences of music with a slight improvement on the range of emotion found in a stimulus set comprised of real-world, traditionally composed musical excerpts.},

abstract = {Following Facebook's introduction of the "Like" in 2009, CaringBridge (a nonprofit health journaling platform) implemented a "Heart" symbol as a single-click reaction affordance in 2012. In 2016, Facebook expanded its Like into a set of emotion-based reactions. In 2021, CaringBridge likewise added three new reactions: "Prayer", "Happy", and "Sad." Through user surveys (N=808) and interviews (N=13), we evaluated this product launch. Unlike Likes on mainstream social media, CaringBridge's single-click Heart was consistently interpreted as a simple, meaningful expression of acknowledgement and support. Although most users accepted the new reactions, the product launch transformed user perceptions of the feature and ignited major disagreement regarding the meanings and functions of reactions in the high stakes context of health crises. Some users found the new reactions to be useful, convenient, and reducing of caregiver burden; others felt they cause emotional harms by stripping communication of meaningful expression and authentic care. Overall, these results surface tensions for small social media platforms that need to survive amidst giants, as well as highlighting crucial trade-offs between the cognitive effort, meaningfulness, and efficiency of different forms of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). Our work provides three contributions to support researchers and designers in navigating these tensions: (1) empirical knowledge of how users perceived the reactions launch on CaringBridge; (2) design implications for improving health-focused CMC; and (3) concrete questions to guide future research into reactions and health-focused CMC.},

The advent of deep learning and more recently vision-language pre-training techniques has revolutionized the field, leading to more sophisticated methods and improved performance. In this survey article, we provide a structured review of deep learning methods in image captioning by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy and discussing each method category in detail. Additionally, we examine the datasets commonly employed in image captioning research, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of different captioning models. We address the challenges faced in this field by emphasizing issues such as object hallucination, missing context, illumination conditions, contextual understanding, and referring expressions. We rank different deep learning methods’ performance according to widely used evaluation metrics, giving insight into the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we identify several potential future directions for research in this area, which include tackling the information misalignment problem between image and text modalities, mitigating dataset bias, incorporating vision-language pre-training methods to enhance caption generation, and developing improved evaluation tools to accurately measure the quality of image captions.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {This paper presents Generative Visual Renku (GVR), a new genre of visual interactive/generative art form inspired by Japanese renku poetry and generative contemporary art. GRIOT, a system for composing generative and interactive multimedia discourse, is used to semantically constrain generated output both visually and conceptually. GVR utilizes GRIOT to implement constraints for visual composition, revealing new technical and aesthetic challenges. Since modular animated graphical systems are ubiquitous in computing culture, ranging from avatars to GUIs, GVR works pose a contribution to a breadth of HCI research and to the development of new theory and technology for integrating AI and the arts.},

abstract = {Abstraction is a fundamental yet challenging skill to teach and learn in Computer Science education. Traditional frameworks of abstraction and concept formation often emphasize understanding an abstraction over its application, the latter being critical for practical Computer Science. Additionally, a common issue in education is when students may understand a concept in a classroom or a very specific setting but struggle to apply it outside of that context. In response, we present here a novel pedagogical framework designed to enhance both the development and application of abstraction skills in diverse educational contexts within the field of Computer Science. Our framework synthesizes common themes from existing models while introducing a new dimension focused explicitly on the actionable development of abstraction skills. Educators can adapt the framework to various educational contexts to support development of students' abstraction skills. Our framework was iteratively developed through a combination of theoretical analysis and reflective practice across multiple teaching contexts. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework by applying it to various case studies, demonstrating its broad applicability and practical utility. By offering a flexible yet comprehensive structure, our framework enables educators to effectively organize and deliver educational content, guiding students from abstract theoretical concepts to their practical application in Computer Science.},

abstract = {Welcome to the 55th annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS 2024)! This year, we have returned to Portland, Oregon. We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 48th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR 2025), taking place in Padova, Italy, from July 13th to July 18th, 2025.This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier international forum for presenting cutting-edge research and showcasing innovative systems and techniques in the broad field of Information Retrieval.SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

This conference series has been founded to foster novel and exciting research in the data and application security and privacy arena and to help generate new directions for further research and development. The initial concept was established by the two co-founders, Elisa Bertino and Ravi Sandhu, and sharpened by subsequent discussions with several fellow data security and privacy researchers. Their enthusiastic encouragement persuaded the co-founders to move ahead with the always daunting task of creating a high-quality conference. CODASPY has become a leading forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on hardware and software security. The conference gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of data and applications security and privacy.This year, the call for papers attracted 165 submissions from 32 different countries, resulting in accepted papers from Asia, Europe, and North America. The submitted papers were peer reviewed and subsequently discussed based on their novelty, quality, and contribution by the members of the Program Committee. The submissions were double blind, and all the members of the Program Committee had access to all the submissions and their reviews at all times to facilitate discussion among the members. The submission and the review process were done using Easychair, a web-based software system. Based on the reviews and discussion, 31 Full Research Papers and 8 Dataset/Tool papers were accepted of the 165 total submissions for an overall acceptance rate of 23\%.},

abstract = {Welcome to The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW'25), held from April 28 to May 2, 2025, at the Sydney Convention \&amp; Exhibition Centre in Australia. Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events. Their collective contributions have made the 2025 edition of this conference a resounding success.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40\% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7\%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

abstract = {Welcome to the 47th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2024), taking place in Washington D.C., USA, from July 14 to 18, 2024.SIGIR serves as the foremost international forum for the presentation of groundbreaking research findings, the demonstration of innovative systems and techniques, and the exploration of forwardthinking research directions in the field of information retrieval.This year's SIGIR is an in-person conference. We believe that an in-person conference is beneficial for several reasons: it fosters direct engagement and networking opportunities, enhances the exchange of research ideas, contributes to a more dynamic and productive conference experience, and nurtures our research community by welcoming newcomers, providing them with the opportunity to become acquainted with SIGIR traditions. This decision has not been made lightly. We understand the challenges that can pose in the aftermath of a pandemic and amidst the uncertainties of the world around us. To accommodate those who cannot attend, we have implemented a series of measures such as proxy presenters, livestreaming, and recording sessions. These steps are taken to ensure that everyone has access to the valuable content that the conference offers.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40\% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7\%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

The Chinese photovoltaic industry serves as a case study. First, we mapped the industrial chain and gathered data on production enterprises. Next, we constructed the overall industrial network and its upstream, midstream, and downstream sub-networks, followed by a preliminary analysis of the network's features. Finally, we simulated network disruptions to assess and analyze the resilience of the industrial chain. The results are as follows: (1) In the Chinese photovoltaic industry, the network density and average degree of each sub-network are generally high, indicating that enterprises are tightly connected, with strong agglomeration and transmission properties. (2) Overall, the Chinese photovoltaic industrial chain demonstrates strong resilience, with the downstream sub-network showing the highest resilience, followed by the midstream, and the upstream exhibiting the lowest resilience.},

Such advancements significantly improve treatment outcomes, reduce surgical risks, and lower the incidence of postoperative complications. To address the poor performance of TransU-Net on small datasets and the issue of the loss of local information, we introduce a hierarchical feature extraction structure similar to the nnUNet [2] baseline network so that the algorithm can adapt to small sample datasets without compromising TransU-Net's capability for large sample operations or its transferable potential. Based on TransU-Net [1], this experiment proposes an algorithm designed for abdominal multi-organ segmentation on small sample training datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves a higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a lower loss value while maintaining a nearly constant quantity of parameters. Compared with the NestedUNet model, which excels in small sample operations, the proposed model improves IoU by 2\%. Compared to the lightweight TransU-Net model, it increases IoU by 10\% and reduces the loss value by 5\%.},

abstract = {With the increase in the volume of data within auditing environment, the risk assessment of audit increasingly depends on data-based anomaly detection and internal control issues detection. In this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model with variational autoencoder Hierarchical Attention-Driven VAE (HAD-VAE) for audit risk scoring and review visualization. The model extends the typical VAE framework, and forms a two-layer hidden structure of latent variables for current study to capture both global behavioral patterns of the audit object and small local differences in transactions’ features. Through the design of attention mechanism and weighting to the modeling of temporal audit features, the model improves the raw skills of perceiving high risk behaviors, and leverages prior risk information from the auditing field to regularize the latent space of embedding, which enables the model to learn more discriminative risk representations. In the decoder side, the model uses two channels to reconstruct path: one channel for numerical fields and another for the semantic descriptions of transactions, which enable fine-grained modeling of the complex data, and supports the following visualization analysis. The loss function of the overall training maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and adds a contrastive loss to further separate high-risk samples from low-risk samples in the latent space. HAD-VAE achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both risk scoring accuracy and anomaly localization.},

Under this perspective, advertising creativity has ushered in unprecedented changes and opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) empowers advertising creativity in the context of meta-universe and promotes its innovation and development. This study constructs a theoretical model with the AI participation effect as the independent variable, consumer perception as the mediator variable, and advertising expectation as the dependent variable to explore the specific influence mechanism of AI-enabled advertising creativity. Meanwhile, the XGBoost algorithm was used to construct a classification model. After data cleaning, standardization, and dividing the dataset into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio, parameters were optimized by combining 5-fold cross-validation. The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision, and SHAP was employed to analyze feature importance. The results of the study show that the better the AI participation effect, the higher the consumer perception, and the better the advertising expectation, also consumer perception plays a mediating role between the AI participation effect and advertising expectation. On this basis, the new situation of future advertising creativity is proposed, namely, the polarization and dynamic generation of personalized ads, the paradigm change of intelligent creative production, and the intelligent placement and scenario expansion of ads.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their potential in time series prediction tasks is gradually being explored. LLMs possess strong feature representation capabilities and the ability to model complex relationships. They have shown significant advantages in areas such as text generation, classification, and time series prediction. However, pre-trained LLMs usually perform well on general tasks but are difficult to apply directly to specific tasks. Fine-tuning is required to adapt them to target domain characteristics. Meanwhile, hotel booking data is often distributed across multiple organizations. This data is privacy-sensitive and unevenly distributed, making traditional centralized training methods unsuitable for privacy protection and collaborative modeling. To address these issues, we propose FPTuning-LLM, a fine-tuning framework for large language models based on Federated Learning and P-Tuning. But time series data cannot be directly input into LLMs trained on discrete tokens. Therefore, we use Time-LLM to embed input sequences and convert them into representations suitable for LLMs. Prompt design is crucial for downstream task performance. We adopt P-Tuning to fine-tune Time-LLM, utilizing lightweight parameters to improve task adaptation. In a federated learning environment, we perform global fusion on the embedding layers of Time-LLM and the LSTM+MLP network in P-Tuning. To address the issue of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data, FedProx is used to constrain local training, enhancing model robustness and global convergence. Experimental results show that FPTuning-LLM effectively improves prediction accuracy while ensuring data privacy by leveraging private data from multiple parties.},

This research presents an innovative intelligent framework for SME credit risk assessment through multi-dimensional data fusion techniques. The proposed methodology integrates traditional financial indicators with alternative data sources including transactional behavior patterns, supply chain relationships, and macroeconomic variables. The framework employs advanced machine learning algorithms including ensemble methods and deep neural networks to process heterogeneous data streams. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional approaches, achieving 92.3\% accuracy in risk classification with reduced false positive rates by 34.7\%. The integration of multi-dimensional features enhances predictive capability while maintaining computational efficiency. This research contributes to the advancement of intelligent financial risk assessment systems and provides practical implications for financial institutions seeking enhanced SME evaluation capabilities.},

abstract = {Rising demand for hyper-personalized wealth management is increasingly unmet by traditional advisory models, which suffer from limitations in scalability, cost-efficiency, and objectivity. While recent AI-driven solutions show promise, they often remain fragmented, focusing on isolated tasks and lacking a unified architecture that integrates long-term strategy with dynamic behavioral adaptation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Wealth-Voyager, a multi-agent framework that synergizes strategic asset allocation with adaptive tactical adjustments. Our system’s architecture uniquely combines AlphaForge, a quantitative engine for establishing a long-term strategic portfolio, with DualAdvisor, a novel Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) grounded role-playing simulation that interactively manages user-specific behavioral biases in response to real-time events. Our proof-of-concept case study, conducted under live market conditions, demonstrated the efficacy of this integrated approach. The system’s adaptive tactical adjustments outperformed a passive baseline, converting a marginal gain into a more substantial return while reducing portfolio volatility. Our work presents a blueprint for a new class of financial co-pilots that integrate quantitative rigor with interactive, cognitively-aware guidance, enhancing both decision quality and user trust.},

abstract = {To investigate the actual emission reduction effect of green bonds under China's "dual carbon" strategy, this study conducts a quasi-natural experiment using a Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) model on a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2016 to 2023. The findings indicate that green bond issuance significantly promotes corporate green transformation, reducing the issuer's carbon emission intensity by an average of 13.8\%. This effect is partially mediated by the promotion of corporate green innovation. However, this reduction effect is not unconditional; it is statistically insignificant for bonds with a low proportion of committed funds or those lacking credible third-party certification, which reveals the existence of "greenwashing" in the market. Further analysis shows the reduction effect is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and heavily polluting industries, highlighting that policy pressure and industrial demand are key drivers for the effectiveness of green finance. Therefore, to ensure the environmental integrity of the green bond market, regulators must strengthen information disclosure standards, promote third-party certification, and establish an evaluation framework based on actual environmental performance. Such measures would effectively curb greenwashing and channel capital toward a genuinely sustainable future.},

The findings reveal two pathways through which digital empowerment impacts platform network performance: directly enhancing network efficiency through technological, platform, and ecological empowerment, and indirectly amplifying network effects via the mediating mechanism of value emergence, including efficiency, integrative, and generative values.

abstract = {Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) in Japan is in the 25th years since its inception, providing eligible elders with both home and institutional services at uniformly low costs. However, there exists a gap between care needs and actual service use. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of both the initiation (contact) and intensity (volume) of service use under LTCI. We applied a modified Andersen model to guide the analysis. Logistic regression models contact, while zero-truncated negative binomial regression models volume. Model performance is evaluated through repeated cross-validation. For the home service contact model, applying SMOTE-ENN increased accuracy by 11.8\% over models without data balancing. For institutional service contact, using SMOTE improved accuracy by 7.8\%. Need variables explained the most variance in the contact with institutional services, but not for that of home service. Enabling variables accounted for the least variance in all outcomes except the contact with institutional services, which was opposite to what the past literature predicted. These findings highlight the complex and non-additive nature of care decisions. Targeted caregiver support is essential to narrow the gap between eligibility and actual utilization. The results also suggest that this analytical approach can inform policy and future research.},

abstract = {In the context of ecological civilization construction, green consumption is of great significance to sustainable development. The generation mechanism and influencing factors of green consumption willingness are worth exploring in depth. Based on consumer value perception and value-belief-norm theory, this study obtained 356 valid samples through questionnaires, with the help of SPSSAU platform to explore the influence of perceived value and sustainable consumption on the willingness to consume green, and the moderating effect of price sensitivity. The results show that the functional, emotional, social, and green values all positively and significantly affect green consumption intention. Also price sensitivity negatively moderates the relationship between perceived value and consumption intention. And sustainable consumption outlook strengthens environmental protection beliefs and ethical norms, and becomes the core driving force of green consumption intention. To further explore consumer heterogeneity, k-means clustering was applied to seven variables. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be two, clearly separating consumers into a price-sensitive group with lower green intention and a high-value-perception group with stronger willingness to consume green. Based on these results, the study proposes the construction of a multi-dimensional value perception system, the implementation of differentiated price strategies, the promotion of sustainable consumption concept education and other guiding paths, to provide theoretical and practical support for the government and enterprises to promote the transformation of green consumption.},

Firstly, a lightweight HRNet posture recognition model with an attention mechanism was constructed. On a self-built dataset containing 100 subjects (covering movements such as running and basketball shooting), the key point detection accuracy reached 92.3\% (PCK@0.5). Secondly, an action error quantification algorithm based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was designed. By comparing the key point position deviations (averaging a reduction of 3.2 centimeters) and joint angle errors (averaging a reduction of 5.7°) between the subjects' movements and the standard templates of professional athletes, precise correction suggestions were generated. Finally, through experiments, the action correction effect of this system was recognized by sports experts at 89.6\%, with an efficiency improvement of over 40\% compared to traditional manual correction. The study demonstrates that the posture recognition technology driven by deep learning can effectively enhance the automation and scientificity of sports movement correction, providing technical support for sports training and national fitness.},

The experimental workflow involves data preprocessing, model implementation, visualization (word clouds, topic distributions, and similarity heatmaps), and quantitative evaluation. Results indicate that BERTopic excels in semantic coherence and topic diversity due to its transformer-based embeddings, making it ideal for interpretability in news analysis, while TF-IDF + KMeans offers superior speed for large-scale applications, and LDA provides a balanced probabilistic baseline. An ablation study on BERTopic components further validates the contributions of UMAP, HDBSCAN, and c-TF-IDF. These findings highlight trade-offs in model selection for news text mining and suggest directions for hybrid approaches in future work.},

Therefore, it is an urgent problem to clarify the influence mechanism of industrial collaborative agglomeration on the high-quality development of urban innovation capacity. In this paper, a machine learning-based approach is proposed to study the influence mechanism of industrial collaborative agglomeration on urban innovation ability. TOPISS model was used to measure the digital development level of Chinese cities from 2010 to 2019. Through multiple linear regression algorithm and inverted U-shape test, it is proved that industrial collaborative agglomeration has a significant positive correlation to urban innovation ability and presents a nonlinear relationship, which is manifested as inverted U-shape characteristics. Using the XGBoost-SHAP machine learning algorithm, we further tested the contribution of each variable to the improvement of urban innovation capability. It is also found that the degree of urban industrial collaborative agglomeration, the level of urban human capital and the level of urban digital development are the key driving factors of the level of urban innovation capability in China.},

abstract = {We introduce BlockGuardian, a next-generation framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) with adaptive parallel processing to deliver precise and scalable analysis of blockchain codebases. Traditional static analyzers rely heavily on rigid rule-based systems, often missing nuanced vulnerabilities and domain-specific inconsistencies. In contrast, BlockGuardian leverages DeepSeek's advanced semantic reasoning across four critical dimensions; structural integrity, code quality, security vulnerabilities, and documentation completeness, to provide a holistic evaluation of blockchain codebases. Extensive benchmarks on leading platforms including Ethereum, FISCO-BCOS, Hyperledger Fabric, and Raychain, demonstrate that BlockGuardian detects 37\% more critical vulnerabilities than state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a false positive rate under 8\%. Moreover, our adaptive parallelization strategy yields an increase in throughput. By uniting LLM-driven natural language understanding with domain-specific security analysis, BlockGuardian sets a new standard for intelligent, high-performance auditing of decentralized applications.},

While various tools track retracted papers, the academic community lacks proactive mechanisms to predict the potential harm caused by citing retracted research. Building upon recent work quantifying the harm, we construct a dataset to forecast the harm papers will suffer from citing retracted research. We further propose a hybrid framework that combines language model with gradient boosted trees. Our framework achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) across all prediction time horizons, achieving a 2.4\% reduction in MAE compared to baseline methods. This work provides foundational resources and methodological insights for future studies on retraction impacts, aiming to help researchers make more informed citation decisions.},

However, the existing SISR technology based on convolutional neural network (CNN) still faces great challenges in the application of resource-constrained mobile devices. For lightweight SISR, we propose a multi-level feature mixing network (MFMN), which achieves high-quality super-resolution image reconstruction at low computational cost. Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

However, DETR still faces low detection accuracy and efficiency problems when dealing with small objects and complex backgrounds. In order to enhance the performance of DETR in aircraft detection, this paper proposes an aircraft detection method based on an improved DETR architecture, which mainly consists of two innovative improvements: first, an ECA attention mechanism is introduced after CNN feature extraction to enhance the model's adaptive learning ability for important features; second, Swin Transformer is used to replace the encoder in the original DETR -decoder structure in the original DETR, using its local windowing self-attention mechanism to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy and speed compared with the traditional DETR in the aircraft detection task, especially in the complex background with better robustness and generalization ability. The research in this paper provides an effective improvement idea for the Transformer-based target detection method and provides new technical support for high-precision target detection tasks in practical applications.},

A widely used method is the Variational Color Shift (VCS), which can automatically predict a range of color shifts for each image.

In this study, we submit a new transformed layer inside the VCS framework using cyclic boundary shifts over the text images. A new module, Transformed Variational Color Shift (TVCS) is proposed. This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset. The experimental results show that TVCS has superior recognition accuracy than VCS and has better robustness against interference. The algorithm proposed is innovative as the data augmentation of text images, especially in a noisy environment.},

We have enhanced the effectiveness of the method for extracting structural lines using the Manhattan World Assumption (MWA) and have suggested utilizing these lines to construct structural planes, which is different from the existing plane extraction methods. Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization. An appraisal of our system on difficult public datasets has been conducted. The trajectory error associated with SLP-SLAM has been diminished by 15\% in comparison to contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM.},

abstract = {In response to the requirements for efficiency and accuracy in segmentation models in autonomous driving scenarios, an improved urban road semantic segmentation algorithm based on the Deep Dual-Resolution Network (DDRNet) has been proposed. Firstly, a Channel Residual Attention Module (CRAM) based on standard attention mechanisms is introduced at the end of two parallel branches of the DDRNet to focus on important channel features. Secondly, the backbone network incorporates Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolution (DO-Conv) to boost feature extraction performance. Finally, a Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) with Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) is designed to capture multi-scale feature information, and Group Normalization (GN) is utilized to mitigate the impact of reduced batch size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 77.0\% on the Cityscapes dataset, representing an improvement of 1.1\% over the baseline model. Additionally, the segmentation speed reaches 106 Frames Per Second (FPS), achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.

Through the designed multimodal feature dynamic fusion mechanism, the weights are adjusted in real time according to the impact of different modalities on sentiment and risk, and then combined with the Transformer-based generative model to predict the evolution trend of public opinion risk, and finally realize dynamic public opinion risk assessment. The experimental simulation uses CMU-MOSI, MOSEI datasets and multimodal public opinion data in specific fields. The results show that in terms of sentiment analysis, the algorithm in this paper has an accuracy of 89.2\%, precision of 88.5\%, recall of 89.0\%, and F1 value of 88.7\% on the CMU-MOSI dataset, and an accuracy of 87.8\%, precision of 87.0\%, recall of 88.2\%, and F1 value of 87.6\% on the MOSEI dataset, which is an average increase of 3.5\%-5.2\% over the accuracy of the comparison algorithm; in public opinion risk assessment, the risk prediction accuracy is 85.6\%, MAE is 0.12, and RMSE is 0.15, which is 4.8\%-6.3\% higher than the comparison method, and MAE and RMSE are reduced by 0.03-0.05 and 0.04-0.06 respectively. The algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of dynamic public opinion risk assessment.},

abstract = {Traffic prediction is a critical task in the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities. Current methods mainly rely on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), which effectively capture spatial dependencies but require significant computational resources and limited to short-term forecasting. However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

However, this approach ignores the large amount of semantic information embedded in the textual descriptions of items, resulting in low performance. The ability to utilize large-scale language models to understand and reason about textual content offers a promising avenue for recommender system development. To this end, we propose a recommender system model, DPRS, which models textual representations of large-scale language models from a data distribution perspective and incorporates them into traditional recommendation models. We utilize pre-trained LLMs as item encoders to introduce textual representations to the recommender system. To address the heterogeneity between the LLM representations and the original recommender system, we propose to model user behavior sequences from a data distribution perspective by converting them into similarity score sequences. By conducting experiments on two public datasets, we verify the superiority of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Transformer have been widely used in the field of natural language processing due to their excellent performance, but the high computational cost and large parameter scale limit the efficiency of actual deployment. As an effective model compression technique, model distillation constructs small-scale student models from large models through knowledge transfer, significantly reducing resource requirements. However, there is a risk of information leakage during the distillation process of the model. This article deeply analyzes the potential mechanisms of information leakage in the distillation process of Transformer, including data reproduction attacks, reverse inference attacks, and other issues. In response to the above risks, a method combining differential privacy technology with secure multi-party computation was proposed for protection, and its effectiveness was verified through experiments. Research has shown that this method can significantly reduce the risk of information leakage while ensuring model performance.},

The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM's shortcomings in command relation understanding can be supplemented by external models to generate promising templates. We do not rule out the contribution of validators to property-specific consistency. However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

abstract = {In recent years, the increasing number of vehicles has led to heightened traffic congestion. Traditional surveillance is limited to monitoring fixed locations. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography provides advantages such as convenience and a wide perspective, gradually replacing these conventional techniques for traffic video collection. Nonetheless, challenges including complex scenes, varying scales and frequent occlusions result in issues such as false positives, missed targets, and identity switches (IDSW). To tackle these, we developed the UVD detection algorithm based on YOLOv8-n and the AByteTrack tracking algorithm derived from ByteTrack. The integration of these two components forms the UVD-ATrack algorithm. In the backbone of the detection section, we introduced the RFAConv and designed RF_C2f to enhance feature extraction capabilities. For the neck component, the adaptive weight fusion module (AWFM) was developed to effectively combine multi-scale local information. During the tracking phase, we optimized the motion model. Additionally, camera motion compensation (CMC) was implemented to adaptively mitigate the effects of sharp perspective changes. Test results utilizing the Visdrone dataset indicate that mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 4.4\% and 3.6\% respectively in the detection section. In the tracking test, IDF1, HOTA, MOTA and MOTP also exhibited significant enhancement while IDSW decreased by 77\%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance.},

abstract = {The automatic spindle detection algorithm based on deep learning technology requires high consistency of sleep spindle annotation, which crowdsourcing can significantly enhance through collective intelligence. To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

The results of the study suggest that there are no gains in script execution speed, generalization rate, or memory usage while there are with great advantage in the run time of the proposed algorithm.

abstract = {Existing multimodal knowledge graph reasoning methods often rely on simple weighted averaging or attention mechanisms for multimodal feature fusion, which frequently results in the loss of modality-specific information and fails to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph reasoning method based on a cross-attention mechanism. The model employs the BERT model to encode textual information, introduces a VGG-16 model with a multi-scale attention module to encode visual information, and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to extract the structural information of the knowledge graph. Additionally, a contrastive learning framework is introduced to reduce semantic inconsistencies between modalities, and a cross-attention mechanism is used to achieve dynamic feature fusion across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were conducted on the FB15k-237 and DB15K datasets. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing benchmark models on key evaluation metrics such as MRR, Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multimodal knowledge graph reasoning.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problem of large differences in feature information between different targets in remote sensing images and the complexity of the scene, an improved SwinIR Transformer remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed, combining residual hybrid attention and spatial-gate feed-forward network. First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics. The experimental results confirm that the model in this paper shows excellent performance in both objective evaluation and subjective visualization.},

abstract = {Simulation is crucial for developing autonomous driving systems, where AI algorithms process sensor data to perceive environments. However, training these algorithms require vast, diverse data, and existing methods face limitations. Manual scene construction in simulation platforms is slow and lacks scalability, while rendering-based approaches often produce inconsistent image sequences, failing to support high-quality algorithm training. Additionally, such methods cannot synthesize multi-modal data essential for perception models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods. Experimental validation showing the system generates consistent, high-quality data for autonomous driving.},

abstract = {Reactive synthesis, or simply synthesis, is primarily used to automatically generate control-intensive programs. Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

Furthermore, deep learning-based traffic image classification models often become overly complex in their pursuit of higher accuracy. In the paper, we propose a deep learning model-based method for the visual detection of DDoS malicious traffic. In response to the issue of model complexity, this article has made improvements based on the EfficientNet model, especially in resource constrained environments. This article introduces CBAM into the original model to improve its ability to process global information. By replacing the loss function in the final Softmax layer of the EfficientNet model, the ability to extract image features for binary classification problems has been enhanced, resulting in improved model performance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively identify various DDoS attacks. Compared with the EfficientNet model, this method has improved accuracy, training time, and single image prediction time.},

Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization.

Firstly, a Channel Residual Attention Module (CRAM) based on standard attention mechanisms is introduced at the end of two parallel branches of the DDRNet to focus on important channel features. Secondly, the backbone network incorporates Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolution (DO-Conv) to boost feature extraction performance. Finally, a Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) with Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) is designed to capture multi-scale feature information, and Group Normalization (GN) is utilized to mitigate the impact of reduced batch size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 77.0\% on the Cityscapes dataset, representing an improvement of 1.1\% over the baseline model. Additionally, the segmentation speed reaches 106 Frames Per Second (FPS), achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

In response, this paper proposes a Neural Network Student Cognitive Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Relational Graph (MGNCD) that brings together the powers of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to model multi-dimensional heterogeneous nodes such as students, classes, problems, and skills. The introduction of various edge types and random edge connection strategies allowed the model to tackle data sparsity and heterogeneity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC), which provides an encouraging novel insight into cognitive diagnosis.},

In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

In order to solve this problem, this study presents a fan anomaly detection method based on an improved CBAM attention mechanism using the MobileNetV3-Small model. In this model, the conventional SE module is replaced with an optimized CBAM, which uses dilated convolutions to enhance the model's sensitivity to anomalous sounds. At the same time, the model incorporates CutMix and Focal Loss as the loss function, further improving the model's robustness to imbalanced data. Additionally, to strengthen the nonlinear representation capacity of the architecture, we implement CELU activation functions as substitutes for conventional ReLU units within residual modules. According to experimental results, we can find that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 97\% in a -6dB noise environment, which is an improvement of 1.07 percentage points over the original MobileNetV3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in fan anomaly detection.},

Future directions underline the development of style-agnostic models, cross-lingual detection frameworks, and robust policies with a view to mitigating LLM-driven misinformation.

However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98\% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},

abstract = {Line detection is an important task in computer vision, which is widely used in fields such as automated driving and remote sensing image processing. As a classical image processing method, Hough transform has strong robustness and anti-interference ability in line detection. In this paper, line detection based on Hough transform is implemented and accelerated to hardware implementation on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) platform. By performing edge detection on the input image, the Hough transform maps the image from Cartesian space to parameter space to detect line features in the image. Experimental results show that the method can accurately detect lines in the image while exhibiting strong noise rejection. The implementation not only improves the efficiency of line detection, but also provides an effective solution for hardware acceleration applications based on the Hough transform.},

abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

abstract = {In the context of the continuous evolution of current network threats, organizations urgently need advanced cybersecurity defense strategies to deal with complex and changeable network attacks. Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system. This study provides a new perspective and practical guidance for the development of cybersecurity defense technology.},

Experiments show that the model performs effectively in sentence datasets containing sensitive words, providing a more fine-grained solution for sensitive information filtering.},

This study introduces generative artificial intelligence into the teaching of fresh food cold chain logistics. A decision-making simulation based on human-computer collaboration has been constructed and is being used to evaluate the actual effect of generative artificial intelligence on enhancing students' dynamic decision-making ability and innovative thinking. Controlled experiments revealed that learners in the experimental group using AI-assisted teaching performed significantly better than the control group in terms of dynamic decision-making ability and innovative thinking. Eighty-eight per cent of learners in the experimental group believed that AI had effectively improved their decision-making efficiency and ability. However, 35 per cent of learners also showed an over-reliance on AI technology during the process of using it. Based on these findings, it is recommended that teaching focuses on developing critical thinking skills when using AI to assist learning.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2\%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and the exponential growth of network information resources, how to help users quickly obtain valuable information has become a major challenge. As the key technology of this problem, recommendation algorithm has become an important tool in the information age. However, most existing recommendation systems, such as traditional deep learning recommendation algorithms, still have problems such as cold start of new users and improper handling of dynamic changes in user behavior. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion Group behavior characteristics and time series characteristics of the recommendation algorithm model Group-Temporal Recommendation Fusion (GTRF). Based on deep learning algorithm, the model extracts group behavioral characteristics by using graph attention network to deal with the problem of cold start, obtains time series characteristics by using gated convolution and GRU to deal with the problem of dynamic changes in user behavior, and finally uses cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these two types of features to achieve high-precision prediction of recommended content. GTRF not only solves the problems such as cold start of new users and dynamic change of user behavior, but also significantly improves the comprehensive performance of recommendation algorithm, showing the indispensable and great potential of recommendation algorithm in information retrieval.},

The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance.

However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

abstract = {Emotional recognition can help machines to capture the emotional state of human beings, which is an indispensable technology for human-computer interaction and the realization of artificial intelligence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

abstract = {Spectrum anomaly detection involves identifying abnormal signals within the electromagnetic spectrum. Most existing methods focus on traditional abnormal signals and can achieve high detection rates through training and testing of neural network models. However, the presence of adversarial samples greatly reduces the performance of existing network models. To address this issue, a spectrum anomaly detection algorithm based on attention mechanism residual neural network is proposed, which can significantly improve the robustness of network models without adversarial training. This method integrates the attention mechanism module and the Residual Network (ResNet), using ResNet18 to process spectrogram data, avoiding gradient vanishing and overfitting during iteration, and using attention mechanism to enhance the model's attention to local information in spectrogram data. The experimental results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms. Compared with ResNet18 and feature transformation based image retrieval adversarial defense algorithms, the new algorithm has increased the AUC value for abnormal signal detection by approximately 47\% and 24\%, respectively, effectively improving the robustness of the network model and reducing the negative impact of adversarial samples on the neural network model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the residual neural network model based on attention mechanism.},

abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively. The generated QA pairs perform well in terms of statistical relevance and contextual consistency.},

During entry, an adult generates an ID code via face detection and associates it with the child's information. During exit, a child can only pass if their ID code matches the associated adult's ID. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.93\%, a single binding time of 2.8 seconds, and a database response time of less than 10 ms under high concurrency (1000 QPS). This system enables accurate guardianship without pre-registration and effectively reduces the risk of children getting lost or being taken by unauthorized individuals.},

abstract = {With the increasing complexity and diversity of network attacks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to address network intrusion detection challenges. However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions.

abstract = {In scenarios with fixed time intervals, discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) is used to represent dynamic networks, such as social networks, traffic networks and biological networks. Existing models introduce self-attention mechanism for structural representation learning on discrete-time dynamic graph and demonstrate good performance in this field. However, temporal encoder in these models focuses on the entire time domain, introducing noise and limiting the model's ability to extract critical information. To address this issue, we propose the DyLF model based on Longformer mechanism. By incorporating the Longformer-based self-attention mechanism, DyLF can flexibly adjust the range of visible time domain while encoding temporal features of nodes in dynamic graphs and efficiently capture temporal dependencies between snapshots, thereby enhancing the ability to extract more effective temporal information. Extensive experiments show that DyLF achieves an average improvement of 4.28\% in AUC and 6.87\% in F1_score with the existing baseline, demonstrate that it is better suited for handling DTDGs.},

abstract = {Traditional homography estimation uses methods such as SIFT and ORB in feature extraction but suffers from problems such as feature sparsity in large baseline scenes with large viewing angles and low overlap, causing inaccurate homography estimation. This paper proposes an unsupervised method that combines edge detection and feature fusion to solve the above problems. Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

abstract = {In response to the problem of insufficient attack traffic samples in network intrusion detection datasets, a hybrid sampling data augmentation method (S-VAE) that combines SMOTE and VAE is proposed. Firstly, train corresponding VAE models for different types of attack traffic samples; Secondly, the SMOTE algorithm is used to extract the original samples and their neighboring samples from the dataset and store them in pairs; Then, the paired samples are fed into the trained VAE model to learn their latent representations separately, and the latent representations of the original and neighboring samples are linearly interpolated; Finally, the results of linear interpolation are fed into the trained VAE decoder to expand the new samples. In this way, a balanced dataset can be established to enable deep learning models to fully learn the features of a small number of samples. The experimental results showed that using convolutional neural network models for multi classification experiments on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, S-VAE increased the classification recall by 3.75 and 3.06 percentage points, respectively, and the F1 score by 6.49 and 4.29 percentage points, respectively, compared to the baseline model.},

abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

This model combines global context with gated slot attention mechanisms, effectively integrating local session graphs with global context graphs to track item changes both within and across sessions. By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise. Experimental results on datasets such as Diginetica, Tmall, and Nowplaying demonstrate that GC-DMRec outperforms other existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

abstract = {This paper aims to design a chatbot application to help people find an appropriate restaurant based on users' preferences and transportation modes. It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80\% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66\% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

abstract = {Most current generative models for anomaly detection, which rely on reconstruction methods, primarily use either Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks. However, VAEs tend to suffer from poor reconstruction quality, while GANs face challenges related to training stability and limited pattern coverage. Additionally, due to privacy and security concerns, the available training data for anomaly detection is often limited, whereas generative models typically require large datasets to avoid the risk of overfitting. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model utilizing diffusion techniques, designed specifically for tabular data, using a reconstruction-based approach. We adopt the diffusion model as the backbone for anomaly detection, aiming to enhance reconstruction quality and ensure training stability. To further improve reconstruction quality and accelerate inference, we employ a truncated diffusion strategy during inference. What's more, to overcome the challenge of insufficient training data, we introduce a SMOTE-based data augmentation method optimized for feature space in tabular data, incorporating a VAE to address the limitations of the original SMOTE algorithm in capturing complex data structures and handling nonlinear relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

Finally, in the classifier learning stage, multiple loss functions are designed to ensure balanced learning across all classes. Experimental results on a publicly available skin dataset with simulated multi-source medical image data demonstrate outstanding performance in handling class imbalance.

abstract = {Online public opinion is increasingly becoming a significant factor affecting the stability of the internet and society, particularly as the frequency of online public opinion crises has risen in recent years. Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task. Our experiments demonstrate that ColKGC achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks. Extensive experiments also bear out ColKGC's efectiveness in generated data and the iterative interaction framework in assisting LLMs reasoning.},

abstract = {With the wide deployment of deep learning models in various applications, the reliability problem of neural networks has gradually become a research hotspot. Computer systems are susceptible to single-particle effects, electromagnetic interference, and other factors in complex environments, resulting in frequent bit-flipping faults. Among them, Silent Data Corruption (SDC), as an imperceptible fault, cannot be detected by the system, which ultimately destroys the output results of neural network models. Current SDC detection techniques mainly focus on the system instruction stream level, and lack efficient methods to implement detection reinforcement at the model level. In addition, due to the black-box weight update mechanism of neural networks, traditional selective redundancy methods cannot provide a reliable explanation of which important weights to fix. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network Reinforcement Framework Based on Neural Network Interpretability (RFNI). RFNI explores the redundancy ratio of convolutional kernels by performing layer-by-layer search in convolutional neural networks through SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent; secondly, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with neural network interpretability algorithms; and finally, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated based on the total Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Second, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with the neural network interpretable algorithm; finally, the granularity configurable redundancy reinforcement is implemented based on the total floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The experimental results show that RFNI on multiple neural network architectures significantly improves the recognition accuracy in case of SDC over existing methods, and can effectively enhance the robustness of the model.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.},

abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

Here, the use of deep learning technologies brings up the problem of single-label classification methods that may not be able to deal with the multi-label one as they do not cover the complex, sometimes coexisting, multiple-pathological features in medical images. To address these challenges, we propose the CTTransNet speculative model, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), which aims to better integrate the local features and the global context. Similarly, a Transformer decoder is used to model inter-label dependencies, and a less-weighted fusing loss mechanism is utilized to deal with the data imbalance issue. The AUC of 81.68\% on the ChestXray14 dataset is achieved by the proposed method, which shows its higher accuracy and superiority to the robustness compared to the traditional methods in multi-label medical image classification. This breakthrough thus brings about the complete information needed for a clinical diagnosis and makes it easier for personalized precision medicine to develop.},

Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced.

Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

abstract = {Crowd counting in dense scenes is a crucial task in the field of computer vision that aims to estimate crowd statistics by predicting the location of heads. However, the accuracy of detection algorithms usually depends on manual precision labeling of a vast amount of data, which is less feasible in practical scene applications due to its high labeling cost. Moreover, the manual labeling process is prone to errors such as false labeling and missing labeling due to overlapping and small targets in the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pseudo label generation algorithm based on semi-supervised learning for dense crowd datasets. The proposed algorithm employs the self-training method of target detection in semi-supervised learning to generate pseudo-labels offline. Furthermore, the algorithm uses existing point labels in dense crowd datasets to correct the positioning information, which significantly reduces the high labeling cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, NWPU-Crowd, and UCF-QNRF, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {Defect recognition in solar panels is critical to safeguard their performance and efficiency. Traditional image recognition models have limitations in fine-grained defect feature extraction, which affects the accuracy and efficiency of recognition. In this paper, we propose an EfficientNet-B3 network optimization model based on the CBAM attention mechanism, which significantly improves the recognition of tiny defects in solar panels by combining deep learning techniques and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our model exhibits high accuracy on both training and validation sets with gradually decreasing loss. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.22\% in complex and variable defect categories, which is significantly better than existing baseline models. An in-depth performance evaluation shows that the model has significant advantages in key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 value, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in the solar panel defect recognition task.},

abstract = {Automatic melanoma detection from dermoscopic skin samples is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96. This model's advantage lies in its efficient feature extraction capability and acceptable inference time per epoch. The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.},

Existing evaluation methods often consider only limited types of attacks, ignoring the generalization performance against new types of attacks, and fail to cover the most advanced defense models. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework to evaluate model robustness under different types of attacks. This framework integrates non-Lp and Lp attacks, and comprehensively evaluates the robustness of various advanced robust models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subsets. Experimental results show that even the most advanced defense models exhibit vulnerabilities under certain new types of attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive robustness benchmarks and providing guidance for the design of future robust deep learning models.},

abstract = {The goal of Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task is to effectively train and deploy object detection models even in small datasets, in order to achieve high-precision object detection results. Due to the few shot size of the dataset, the model may have difficulty learning sufficiently generalized feature representations, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting issues. Specifically, the model performs well during training, but shows a significant poor performance on test. That's because model overfits the noise and specific samples of the data in the training set, resulting in the inability to generalize to new data. Secondly, in the case of few shots, the target category scale in the dataset is single, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the same target at different scales, which affects detection accuracy. In order to effectively perform FSOD tasks, this paper proposes a meta learning FSOD algorithm based on PRN-FPN. Firstly, a data augmentation module is proposed to address the issue of data scarcity in few shot situations. The module includes three conversion strategies: color, color, and histogram equalization. Combining these three strategies can effectively increase the diversity of scarce data. In order to improve the algorithm's recognition and detection of targets of the same category but different scales, a Predictor head Removing Network with Feature Pyramid Network (PRN FPN) module is proposed. The module adds CARAFE Feature Pyramid Network on the basis of Predictor head Removal Network (RPN), and has the ability to detect few shot objects at multiple scales by fusing features at different depths. Finally, the algorithm was trained and tested on the publicly available dataset Pascal VOC, and the experimental results showed its effectiveness.},

By simplifying the quantification process of risk factors for transportation vehicles passing through densely populated areas, with the goal of minimizing the number of vehicles, the total transportation distance, and the shortest driving distance through densely populated areas, an optimization model for the transportation path problem of hazardous goods vehicles is established. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on probability model is designed for the model. Taking a hazardous material transportation network with 5 transportation vehicles, 24 demand nodes, and 6 densely populated areas as an example, validate the model and algorithm. The example results show that the Pareto solution of the vehicle routing problem can be obtained using this algorithm, providing decision support for the scheduling of hazardous goods transportation vehicles.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to automatically generate diverse and valuable digital content. Integrating with AIGC, vehicular networks are evolving as the next-generation intelligent transportation system, i.e., vehicular Metaverses, which can significantly enrich the diverse and personalized immersive experience of vehicular applications for drivers and passengers. Nevertheless, due to the high demand for AIGC services and the limited coverage of RoadSide Units (RSUs), it is still challenging to efficiently allocate RSU resources for massive vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for real-time resource allocation in vehicular AIGC services, which considers both price and non-monetary attributes. In this mechanism, we first formulate the resource-attribute matching problem as a weighted bipartite graph to determine potential market participants. Then, we train an auctioneer in a double Dutch auction using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the clock adjustment process. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based auction scheme outperforms existing baseline schemes in terms of average cumulative reward, convergence speed, social welfare, and auction information exchange costs.},

abstract = {Pedestrian detection is commonly studied using visible light (RGB) images. However, in environments with poor lighting or occlusions, the performance of object detection using RGB images tends to be subpar. In contrast, infrared (IR) images yield better results in such special circumstances. Therefore, multispectral image fusion for pedestrian detection is increasingly being adopted. While this feature interaction and fusion approach enhances features, it can also introduce background noise, preventing the model from focusing on pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight network with Unet and attention mechanism (UANet). UANet enhances the accuracy of pedestrian detection under varying illuminance by combining the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. In UANet, a UNet-based module is designed for extracting and reusing multi-scale features from RGB images. To further extract high-level features, we incorporate a fully connected module into the UNet-based module. For infrared images, we employ high-frequency attention and average attention to extract target features from infrared images and fuse them with RGB features. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of UANet in improving pedestrian detection performance. We conducted tests on the KAIST dataset, yielding a result of 95.23\% mAP and 7.65\% MR.},

In this paper, the influence of the structure size, circuit connection mode and fixing mode of the 0kHz-35kHz receiving transducer on the performance of the receiving transducer is numerically simulated. It is concluded that shorter and thicker piezoelectric patches can effectively improve the receiving sensitivity, bandwidth and stability of the receiving transducer. The series circuit connection mode has good reception sensitivity stationarity, and the reception sensitivity stationarity is improved by 23.8dB, but its reception sensitivity stationarity is extremely poor. The fixed boundary condition at both ends can obviously broaden the receiving bandwidth of impulse sound source receiver and transducer, but the receiving sensitivity of fixed boundary condition at both ends is smaller than that of free boundary condition and free boundary condition at one end. This conclusion has theoretical reference significance for the manufacture of impulse sound source receiving transducer.},

This study proposes a method for detecting SQL injection attacks based on an improved Text-CNN model. The method starts with the preprocessing of collected SQL injection attack data, followed by the use of the convolutional layers of the Text-CNN model to extract local features, and then combines the CAM attention mechanism to achieve the task of SQL injection detection. The introduction of the CAM attention mechanism aims to merge the information from max pooling and average pooling to reduce information loss and enhance the global representation capability of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has improved in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 score, with values of 92.40\%, 92.45\%, 92.29\%, and 0.9237, respectively. Given that traditional Text-CNN, Text-RNN, and CNN algorithms can perform well in recognizing SQL injection attacks, this provides help for subsequent applications in network security protection.},

In order to achieve the style transfer between Chinese ink paintings and Van Gogh's artworks, this paper introduces a self-made new dataset and implements the transformation between these two artistic styles based on the CycleGAN network model. Furthermore, through methods such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment, this study extensively explores the key factors affecting the learning process of the adversarial loss function in CycleGAN. The results reveal that augmenting the self-made dataset through data enhancement techniques, such as adding noise and color transformations, can enhance the robustness of the model. Additionally, employing the "learning rate warm-up" strategy effectively updates parameters during training, leading to better fitting to the optimal solution.},

This approach aims to overcome challenges related to the limited capacity for extracting features from irregularly shaped road crack targets and the sluggish inference speed caused by the intricate model structure. In this algorithm, YOLOv7 is used as the foundation. Firstly, the Detect module is improved to a Decoupled Head Detect module to augment the detection capacity of the model on feature maps. Then, the Head part is augmented with an ELAN-G module based on GSConv to reduce the model's parameter computation and accelerate the inference speed. Finally, Deformable Conv is employed to modify the original ELAN module into an ELAN-D module and integrate it into the Backbone part to bolster the model's capability in extracting irregular-shaped crack targets. Experimental results on the CRDDC-2020-US dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a 10\% enhancement in detection accuracy, with the mAP(0.5) increasing from 53.7\% to 59.4\%. Furthermore, the model's parameter computation is decreased by 12\%, while the throughput in terms of the number of images processed per second during inference is boosted by 13\%. This algorithm proves to be effective for road crack detection applications.},

So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network. Finally, the experimental sample set was used to conduct comparative experiments on soil profile ruler detection between the algorithm in this paper and other target detection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 3.7\% in precision, 1.6\% in recall, 2.1\% in mAP50, and 1.5\% in mAP50-90 compared with the original YOLOv5s model. After YOLOv5s is trained with transfer learning, the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 2.2\% in precision, 2.9\% in recall, 0.3\% in mAP50, and 7.8\% in mAP50-90. compared with YOLOv3 -tiny, YOLOv5m, YOLOv6 and YOLOv8s of the YOLO series, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates better accuracy, recall and mAP50.

abstract = {As we advance in time, with the evolution of the computer industry and the escalating intricacy of diverse software, the demand for source code defects is also increasing.&nbsp;Traditional deep learning-based software defect detection methods perform well on synthetic defect datasets, but their performance on real software defect datasets is unsatisfactory. At the same time, pre-trained models derived from extensive data training are extensively employed in various NLP tasks and have achieved excellent results.&nbsp;Based on this background, this study introduces a software defect detection system leveraging CodeBERT and Bi-LSTM. This method first preprocesses and standardizes the C source code to minimize the impact of redundant information and reduce noise;&nbsp;Secondly, coding sequences are segmented and encoded using the CodeBERT pre-trained model, capturing the semantic features within the program's code and converting them into vectors containing code feature information and output;&nbsp;Then, the output of the received CodeBERT is processed through the Bi-LSTM network to acquire the structural composition inherent to the code and the semantic information of the positive and negative terms;&nbsp;Finally, the vectors containing source code features are classified using a fully connected network to determine whether the code segment has defects.&nbsp;To verify the impact of this approach, we used the cross-language benchmark test set CodeXGLUE proposed by Microsoft Research Institute for evaluating code tasks for validation. The results showed that this method had higher accuracy in detecting real software defect samples than other methods, indicating that the proposed method can effectively improve software defect detection capabilities.},

abstract = {The accurate decoding and intention recognition of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) are of great significance for the implementation of brain computer interface (BCI). However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22\% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20\%, 9.42\%, 4.50\%, and 5.40\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

abstract = {Music recommendation systems have become one of the research directions that have attracted much attention in the field of digital entertainment. However, current music recommendation methods are mainly recommended through collaborative filtering, content-based, and manual rule methods, and cannot be recommended based on the user's real-time status, resulting in the recommended music does not meet the real-time needs of users. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a personalized music recommendation model based on human physiological signals. This model first analyzes the user's physiological data, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, etc., and uses a graph convolutional neural network algorithm to perceive the user's real-time emotional state. It then achieves more accuracy and personalization music recommendations based on the relationship model between emotion and music selection. This research not only expands the research scope in the field of music recommendation, but also provides new ideas and methods for the further development of intelligent music recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Most recent algorithms of RGB-T salient object detection have two issues remain unresolved. The first one is that existing methods don't fully explore and exploit the potentials of complementary of different modalities and multi-type cues of images, which play a vital role in achieving accurate results. And the second is that it is difficult to determine which of the two modalities contributes more in the feature fusion stage.To address these problems, we propose a dual-decoder importance-aware gated network called LNet. Specifically, we set the dual-decoder architecture to solve the cross-modality interaction problem. It can dig out the characteristics of two modalities, and fuse the cross-modality complementarity information more effectively. In particular, the importance-aware gated part Screening Mechanism (SM) can suppress saliency bias and let model avoid obtaining the results dominated by one modality.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LNet achieves better performance than the 11 state-of-the-art on three public datasets.},

abstract = {In general, grammar polishing systems recombine words and their order of combination based on the comparison results of word combinations and large vocabulary grammar data to achieve error polishing. However, this process is limited by the storage capacity of the large vocabulary grammar, which hampers the effectiveness and efficiency of error polishing. To overcome this constraint, deep learning algorithms are employed. These algorithms involve reconstructing the underlying hardware framework and optimizing the error polishing calculation parameters of the system software using deep learning algorithms. This allows for global replacement of deep learning algorithms, enhances the system's self-learning ability for error polishing, and frees it from the limitations of large vocabulary grammar information. The test results demonstrate that the continuous error polishing ability of this approach is superior. Among the error polishing systems tested, the designed system exhibits the best overall stress test performance, showcasing strong stability and control. The overall stability demonstrated by the stress test aligns with the standards and requirements of practical applications. As a result, the design system possesses good overall error polishing ability, system stability, and practical applicability.},

The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation. These strategies have been proven to offer valuable insights for achieving financial success.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant progress in the quality of neural machine translation technology, largely attributed to the abundance of high-quality bilingual parallel sentences. However, low-resource languages face a challenge as the availability of bilingual parallel corpora is limited, leading to subpar translation performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a data augmentation approach based on semantic word replacement specifically designed for neural machine translation of low-resource languages. The method comprises two key steps: firstly, expanding the corpus of low-resource languages through semantic word replacement techniques; secondly, utilizing a neural grammar correction model to proofread the augmented bilingual parallel corpora. Subsequently, these corrected corpora are merged with the original corpus to mitigate the data scarcity for low-resource languages. Experimental evaluations were conducted on various low-resource language pairs (including Mongolian-Chinese, Tibetan-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese, Arabic-Chinese) as well as English-German and German-English translation tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the translation quality of low-resource languages, achieving a maximum BLEU score improvement of up to 3.06 compared to the baseline system, underscoring the efficacy of the approach.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive technology of defect classification method for pressure gas cylinders based on on-site collection of gas cylinder defect data set. The main work is as follows: 1) Aiming at the problem of insufficient number and unbalanced distribution of field-collected defect samples, a DA-DCGAN based on the dual-channel attention mechanism is designed to increase the sample data, and a self-attention generator and a dual-channel discriminator are constructed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated samples; 2) Based on the augmented and broadened dataset, a design of a cascaded HRNet classification network is proposed to increase the quality of pressure gas cylinders by means of global feature extraction, and local feature extraction for feature fusion to achieve multiple classification of defects based on infrared gas cylinder images. Compared with the mainstream classification methods DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, the cascaded HRNet method improves the average AUC by 6.1\% and achieves the highest scores in two defect types. For temperature fluctuation experiments under real working conditions, good performance is achieved, proving the effectiveness and anti-interference of the improved model.},

abstract = {The Putian dialect is an ancient language with a rich historical and cultural background. Currently, there is a lack of published research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology for the Putian dialect due to various reasons. One notable example is the absence of an audio corpus specifically for this dialect. Moreover, the pronunciation of Putian dialect significantly differs from that of Mandarin used in our daily lives. This paper aims to address these challenges by collecting 8000 isolated words from a phonetic corpus dedicated to the Putian dialect. Based on this self-built database, I attempt to achieve speech recognition for the Putian dialect using various models such as single phoneme model recognition, three-phoneme model, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood change, speaker adaptive training, quick model and DNN-HMM model. Notably, the DNN-HMM-2 model yields the best results with a word error rate of 20.56\%. In this experiment, I introduce an additional layer of mapping in order to construct a two-step mapping method for phoneme - Putian dialect - Mandarin alignment. This approach improves training alignment accuracy and reduces character error rate by approximately 3\% compared to using only one-level mapping.},

abstract = {The development of big data provides abundant resources for enterprises to target users and adjust development strategies. However, it also brings about an escalating risk of personal information leakage. In this context, the methods and standards for determining the acts of infringement have yet to be clarified, leading to different judgements in the same case. Grounded on the existing modes of legislation and judicial adjudication, the paper proposes machine learning methods to deconstruct the determination of acts of infringement, with a goal of assisting judges in making more accurate judgments. Specifically, the paper employs Adaboost regression model and the logistic regression model with gradient descent. Adaboost regression model combines multiple weak classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification, while the logistic regression model with gradient descent adjusts model values by minimizing the loss function to pursue the optimal ones. Through training and evaluation, the paper reveals that these models possess favorable applicability in determining the acts of infringement. Moreover, the paper also mentions the predictive results and evaluation metrics of the models, as well as their validation and application under various determination methods.Through the application of mathematical models and machine learning algorithms, the paper deconstructs the methods of infringement determination in personal information protection disputes. The evaluation and analysis of the models' applicability provides a guarantee for its adaption to different methods of determination, ensuring a reliable algorithmic model for the judicial review of personal information protection disputes when applying machine learning.},

The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

Specifically, as changes in the topological structure and unstable communication are likely to cause security problems in communication of drones in the battlefield, two dynamic key update protocols, i.e., topology-aware key update and mutual-healing key update, are put forth here to ensure secure communication through dynamically-updated keys. Analyses reveal that the proposed scheme has forward and backward security and resistance to collusion attacks and replay attacks. Meanwhile, the proposed method has been compared with existing methods through tests on the popular MIRACL dataset by Visual Studio 2019, and the test results show that our method optimizes the computing performance and the communication overhead, and achieves higher updating efficiency.},

abstract = {In response to the problem of complex visual feature categories and sparse datasets for related refined categories in traffic accidents, this article has created a traffic accident target detection dataset, the AccOD dataset, which is divided into five categories. This dataset can serve as a benchmark for training and evaluating traffic accident target detection algorithms. Aiming at the real-time, accuracy, and intelligence issues of traffic accident detection, an improved traffic accident target detection network based on YOLOv8 is proposed. This network replaces a more efficient backbone network structure and improves the downsampling module that integrates different scale features in the head network, reducing the number of model parameters and computational complexity while improving the detection accuracy of the model. The C2f module is improved to balance various contextual information, further enhancing the detection ability of the model. The experiment showed that the improved model achieved a 4.75\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 4.58\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the AccOD dataset compared to YOLOv8n, and a 2.14\% improvement in mAP0.5 and 6.23\% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the open source ACD dataset. This algorithm improves the detection accuracy of traffic accidents and maintains the lightweight of the model, providing an effective method for intelligent traffic accident detection.},

abstract = {For the increasingly complex network environment, new types of attacks are emerging, and the limited attack samples may not be sufficient for traditional detection methods to achieve good detection results. In this regard, this paper proposes a few-shot detection method based on meta-learning, which mainly consists of three parts: data preprocessing, feature extraction and comparison, and classification and detection. The original data samples are transformed into grey scale graphs, and after combining the samples two by two, they are respectively subjected to feature extraction and comparison, which results in similarity scores, which are finally used to carry out classification. It is shown through experiments that the accuracy of detection can reach up to 98.45\% in the case of few-shot.},

Based on this experience, they argue for the value of embracing and reflecting on failure in GAI-assisted qualitative research. To frame this argument, they draw on two theories of generative failure: failing forward, which uses failures to iterate on designs to meet existing criteria, and failing sideways, which reconsiders the criteria for success. Using a fail-forward perspective, the authors describe how they might revise their research methods for data preparation, process documentation, and task delegation to create more reliable results. Then, using a fail-sideways perspective, they reexamine criteria for publishable results to reimagine the study more fundamentally.},

abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

abstract = {Regular network traffic prediction techniques, which generally rely on data normalization, often fail to account for the non-stable characteristics of network traffic, leading to a decline in estimate reliability. A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

abstract = {In addressing the limited receptive field of single-layer convolution in EEG emotion recognition, the need to stack multiple layers of convolution for expanding the receptive field poses challenges of increased parameter size and training cost. Simultaneously, there is an oversight of channel information in EEG emotion recognition. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition. The Inception structure is enhanced to fit EEG signals, enabling multi-scale convolution. The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the DCSL network in EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8\% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2\%, marking an improvement of 3.9\% and 10.1\%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4\%, 33.3\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection. It provides an efficient and lightweight PCB small target defect detection solution for scenarios with limited computing resources.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of the Internet, APT malware detection remains an important issue for society. The lengthy nature of API sequence text leads to polysemy issues with distant repeated words. Traditional deep learning models must improve extracting the long-term dependencies of entire API sequences. During an APT attack, attackers combine benign and malicious sequences to conceal their malicious intent, resulting in localized malignancy. In response to these issues, the paper proposes A BERT-Transformer-TextCNN model for attack detection. BERT encodes API sequences, addressing the polysemy issue of distant repeated words. The Transformer-encoder extracts long-term dependencies, resolving the global feature issues of long sequences, and TextCNN is applied to capture local sequence information to solve the problem of localized malignancy. Based on actual APT malware samples, BERT encoding achieves higher precision than traditional encoders. Employing a Transformer-Encoder to extract long-term dependencies yields higher precision than using BiLSTM to extract long-term relationships. When adding features related to local feature correlation, the precision increased by 3.39\%.},

However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

abstract = {Intelligent question-answering systems have been widely applied in the field of electric power. However, with the complexity of terms in the electric power field, the generic word-based encoding approach of natural language understanding model fails to identify those domain phrases even if they appear in the training samples. To improve the semantic accuracy of special content labeling, this paper proposes a words-phrase fusion encoding NLU model with the help of domain corpus. We pre-train a phrase-level Bert model in the electric power field which is involved during the model encoding step to accurately capture the semantics of domain terms and perceive the boundary of phrases. Additionally, continuous consistency loss of sequences is added to the model to reduce the to reduce the misclassification of individual words in the phrases. Experiment with real dataset in power QA system demonstrates that our model helps improve semantic parsing accuracy on both training and untrained items, alleviates the complete dependency of the phrase encoding model on word segmentation results.},

abstract = {Aiming at the traditional fall detection algorithms that suffer from low detection accuracy and poor real-time performance in dealing with small targets and multi-scale features in complex scenes, this study proposes a fall detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv8 model. First, the SCConv module is utilized to combine with the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone network to construct the C2fSC module, which enhances the feature extraction capability of the model while reducing the computational complexity. Second, the SPPF module is integrated with the BAM attention mechanism to weaken the influence of background interference. Finally, WIoU is used to replace the original loss function to optimize the positioning accuracy of the bounding box and enhance the overall performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model improves 4.9\%, 4.2\%, and 4.4\% in P, R, and mAP metrics, respectively, and the number of parameters and FLOPs are only 2.8M and 7.7G, which proves that the improved model has excellent robustness and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

However, at this stage, they can only be trained using 3D point cloud data to generate simple 3D shapes based on point cloud representations. Building on this, we propose HoloDiT. It uses a set of real-world 2D images and corresponding camera poses as input, generating 3D auxiliary samples that are fed into a Transformer-based 3D diffusion model for training in 3D shape generation. By training the rendering function to generate color and density, we can restore the color details of object surfaces. This enables HoloDiT to generate realistic 3D shapes from 2D images. We trained on the real-world CO3Dv2 dataset, and the generated results demonstrate competitive quality and consistency compared to existing 3D generation models.},

abstract = {With the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into cultural heritage dissemination, users' digital interactions in museums have evolved from passive information reception to active co-creation. To investigate the mechanisms through which GenAI usability influences user enjoyment, this study applies the Hedonic Motivation System Adoption Model (HMSAM) and develops a theoretical framework incorporating six mediating constructs: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, sense of control, and immersion. Based on 582 valid responses collected from the “Cloud Tour of Dunhuang” digital heritage initiative, structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. The findings reveal that GenAI usability does not directly affect users' enjoyment; instead, its influence is transmitted indirectly through several psychological mediators. Specifically, GenAI usability significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, curiosity, joy, and control, each of which contributes to users’ enjoyment, with joy demonstrating the strongest mediating effect. Although GenAI usability also increases users’ sense of immersion, immersion itself does not significantly predict enjoyment. These results extend the applicability of HMSAM in the cultural technology domain, deepen the theoretical understanding of user behavior in smart museums, and offer practical guidance for optimizing GenAI-based interactive system design in cultural heritage contexts.},

It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.},

abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.

abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Thanks to the large datasets collected from the internet, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress across various fields, with widespread applications in digital employees, intelligent customer service, and smart decision-making. However, during the training process, models may memorize sensitive private data, posing risks to data security and privacy protection. Member Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to determine whether a specific record was used in the training of the target model. This approach is crucial for detecting privacy risks in models and has seen substantial progress in both traditional and fine-tuned models. However, this remains an unresolved issue for large language models (LLMs). Recent studies indicate that under proper experimental setups, the AUC-ROC of existing methods approaches 0.5 (random guessing). Subsequently, some research has shifted MIA to dataset inference, achieving promising results in this area. Our study shows that when fine-tuning a target model with aggregated samples, it is possible to distinguish whether these samples were used in training the target model by observing the initial loss returned by the model. Based on this observation, we propose a fine-tuning-based member inference method for large language models. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on three mainstream models and seven datasets. The results indicate that member inference attacks with aggregated samples can achieve acceptable outcomes.},

abstract = {An adaptive fast robust scaled consensus tracking problem for multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown dynamics is studied in this paper under a directed graph. Each agent's dynamic is described by a high-order differential equation, which includes time delays and uncertainty. A novel fully distributed adaptive control method is proposed to ensure that all following agents track the leader with prescribed scaled ratios asymptotically, and the tracking errors are uniform ultimate boundedness. Meantime the proposed approach guarantees the bounded adaptive estimates of the unknown parameters and dynamics, and can lighten the burden on computation because it only needs to update a small number of adaptive parameters. The control gain of each agent is heterogeneous and time-varying. It changes and updates by the designed distributed adaptive law. The presented protocol doesn't need to know global nonzero eigenvalues of communication graph adjacency matrix, and is independent of any global information. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a numerical example.},

The variable scales involved in the experiments were mature scales, and ANOVA and the process in SPSS were used for testing.Findings–Study 1 indicates that followers react negatively to influencers' adoption of GenAI for social media production, which is mitigated when influencers engage in honesty-based motive explanation disclosure. Study 2 reveals that influencer motive attribution and perceived influencers' authenticity play chain-mediated roles in the effects of GenAI's adoption of disclosure type on followers' attitudes and behaviors.Originality/value–First, this study extends the GenAI marketing literature, which is still in its infancy, to provide a novel idea and framework for studying social media content creation by GenAI. Second, this study draws on the literature in the field of sponsored disclosure to further demonstrate the potential effectiveness of similar motive explanation for this approach.},

However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of web-based generative artificial intelligence technologies necessitates that all students experience teaming with such technologies -- exploring their strengths and limitations and learning how to create synergy with them. To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing e-commerce logistics by integrating AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Back Propagation (BP) neural networks, further refined through Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Utilizing cargo volume data over a two-year period, we developed a sophisticated ARIMA-BP model to forecast the daily cargo volume for each route for the subsequent month. The subsequent application of a GA-optimized BP neural network aims to achieve a multi-objective optimization, focusing on minimizing the impact of route disruptions and balancing workload distribution across the network. We employed network centrality measures—degree, closeness, and betweenness—to evaluate the significance of logistics sites and routes, enhancing the network's resilience and operational efficiency. This approach also facilitated the integration of new logistics sites and routes, bolstering network performance. Further, we introduced a stochastic perturbation technique to explore the network's adaptability to both anticipated and unforeseen flow changes post-route closure. Finally, complex network topology analysis was applied to assess the robustness of the logistics network. Our methodology exemplifies a comprehensive strategy for e-commerce logistics optimization, offering a robust framework for enhancing network resilience and efficiency in face of emergencies, thereby contributing to the reduction of operational costs and improvement of service quality.},

abstract = {Regular network traffic prediction techniques, which generally rely on data normalization, often fail to account for the non-stable characteristics of network traffic, leading to a decline in estimate reliability. A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

This study builds upon the Onsets and Frames model and introduces a series of structural improvements aimed at enhancing model performance. These include the simplification and optimization of the model structure, the introduction of data augmentation strategies, and the refinement of the loss function. Precise quantization of the model, coupled with effective mobile deployment strategies, ensures the efficient operation of the model on mobile devices. Experimental validation in the mobile environment demonstrates that the proposed improvements significantly enhance transcription accuracy in various scenarios, achieving a 56.98\% increase in transcription speed compared to the original model, thereby meeting the requirements for real-time transcription. Moreover, the new model exhibits substantial noise resistance capabilities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions where the performance degradation is considerably less than that of the original model.},

abstract = {AI-pair programming is a novel approach to software development that involves a human developer and an AI assistant working together on the same code. AI-pair programming aims to improve the productivity, quality, and creativity of software development by leveraging the complementary strengths of human and AI agents. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on its impact on code quality and developer satisfaction. In this paper, we conduct a case study of TiMi studio, a leading mobile game development studio group that has been using AI-pair programming tools since 2023, and has produced several popular and high-quality games. We collect and analyze data from code repositories, code reviews, developer surveys, and developer interviews, to measure and compare the code quality and developer satisfaction of AI-pair and non-AI-pair projects. The results show that AI-pair programming has a positive impact on code quality and developer satisfaction, as it offers various benefits, such as time-saving, error-avoiding, skill-learning, possibility-exploring, feedback-receiving, and quality-improving. The results also reveal some challenges, such as reliability-questioning, explainability-questioning, trust-lacking, communication-lacking, autonomy-losing, and motivation-losing, which need to be addressed and overcome by improving and enhancing the AI-pair programming tools and practices. The paper provides empirical and practical evidence on the impact of AI-pair programming on code quality and developer satisfaction, and provides useful and actionable insights and guidance for developers, managers, researchers, and educators, who are interested in or involved in AI-pair programming, and who want to improve and optimize their software development process and outcomes.},

While Generative AI has a multitude of exciting applications for the fields of writing, coding, and graphic design, its usage to personalize our virtual space has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.},

However, AI-generated images often lack cultural context, which risks cultural bias and the loss of cultural significance. This study explores the use of GAI in generating culturally meaningful patterns, focusing on Chinese intangible cultural heritage Huayao cross-stitch as a case study. By applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize T2I tools and using in-situ interviews and focus groups, we collected feedback from 18 Huayao artisans. The results show that while fine-tuned models improved stylistic accuracy, the cultural meaning of the patterns remained insufficient. This research highlights AI's limited role in cultural innovation and emphasizes the necessity for dynamically maintaining cultural authenticity through the daily practices of cultural holders. It also reflects on how AI might have a long-term impact on the creative position of artisan communities.},

Nowadays, soccer has been deeply integrated with artificial intelligence, and this paper combines artificial intelligence technology with deep learning, and for the difficult task of detecting players and soccer, firstly, we propose to use the deep learning-based image segmentation technology Mask R-CNN, and optimize the related computation by using residual network + feature pyramid network + RoI Align, and using binary cross-entropy loss function to predict the Pixel category not only highlights the boundaries of the image compared to traditional target detection methods, but also achieves pixel-level segmentation of each detection target, and achieves more accurate detection of players and soccer balls. Based on this, another algorithm optimized YOLOv3 is proposed for the lack of speed of Mask R-CNN, which employs a more efficient feature extraction network - -GhostNet and choosing a more appropriate a priori frame size and number and proposing the CIoU loss function for calculating the loss value of target localization to achieve a more efficient and lightweight detection of targets. Finally, for the simulated match, with the clubs, players, and soccer balls of both sides of the match as the detection targets, the data such as passes, shots, players' activity ranges, and other specific tasks are visualized and analyzed at the macro, meso, and micro levels.},

The attention mechanism combines channel attention and spatial attention, which helps to the proposed model effectively select sample points with high signal-to-noise ratio in the traces and assign weights, and then the feature extraction ability of the proposed model is improved. Furthermore, the densely connected convolutional network makes the enhanced features clearer and transmission of gradients more effective through dense connections, which would improve the training effect of the model. The tested results on four public data sets of the AES algorithm show that, compared with the existing deep learning side-channel attack models, the attention mechanism can effectively improve the feature extraction ability of the proposed model, so that the model have more adaptable to different datasets, then the number of traces needed to complete key recovery is reduced.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

However, existing studies still lacks systematic modeling of the implementation mechanism of this public fund allocation model. In response to the inherent complexity of the operating logic of this model and the unstructured characteristics of policy texts and enterprise data, this paper innovatively proposes a large language models-based multi-agent collaborative intelligent allocation method for public funds. This method consists of three core intelligent agents: policy agent, enterprise agent, and match agent. Among them, the policy agent is responsible for parsing policy texts and simulating government decision-making processes. The enterprise agent constructs the enterprise profile by integrating structured and unstructured data, and automatically generate funding application forms. The match agent is responsible for outputting the matching results and their decision basis. Through experimental research on a real-world dataset, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has become a hot topic nowadays, as its powerful content generation models enable users to instantly create everything from digital media products to coding examples through simple text queries, providing more possibilities in the field of education. This study aims to investigate the impact of Generative AI intervention in teaching App Inventor programming courses, analyzing the differences between UI materials designed by traditional teachers based on their professional knowledge and experience, and UI materials created by Generative AI in classroom teaching. The study also evaluates the impact of Generative AI on students' learning outcomes and motivation through satisfaction and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires. The results indicate that UI materials produced through Generative AI effectively enhance students' satisfaction with the course and their acceptance of new technologies. Compared to traditional teaching methods, Generative AI significantly saves teachers' time and effort in designing materials while simultaneously improving teaching efficiency and quality.},

abstract = {In recent years, image dehazing tasks have primarily focused on urban or indoor scenarios, with little attention paid to the study of image dehazing in forest fire contexts. The degradation of images caused by the dense smoke generated by forest fires poses a significant obstacle to firefighting and rescue operations. Unlike ordinary haze, the smoke produced by forest fires is characterized by its non-homogeneous density, which complicates the process of smoke removal. Moreover, there is limited research dedicated to smoke removal specifically in wildfire environment images. To address this gap in image dehazing research for forest fire scenarios, this study trains and tests various specialized dehazing methods on a new public dataset for forest fire dehazing, Fo-haze. The methods are divided into four groups based on their network structures and training strategies. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the models' performance, the study aims to assist firefighters in assessing the dehazing capabilities of different models. The experimental results indicate that the CHaIR model from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, achieved the best results, with a PSNR of 27.11 dB and an SSIM of 0.8721.},

abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23\%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

Findings uncover ways people with MCI and dementia want to use AI to engage in resilience building activities related to fostering wellness, building social connections, and finding purpose. Though each of these use cases came with trade-offs in embracing healthy thinking. Based on these findings, we discuss directions for future work in AI for resilience building in dementia.

abstract = {The use of mobile phone APP meter reading reduces the probability of human intervention and misidentification, but due to the complex location and geographical conditions of the buried water meter, as well as the base code and gear in the water meter dial, there are problems of low accuracy and rough segmentation results when the water meter word wheel region is divided, so a YOLO v8 segmentation method based on coordinate attention mechanism is proposed. The backbone network incorporates the AM (Attention-MobileNet_block) module to apply the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, which facilitates the extraction of multi-scale features, reduces model parameters and computational complexity, and enhances computing efficiency. In the feature fusion stage, the C2f_CA mechanism, based on the Bottleneck_CA module, effectively mitigates background interference while concentrating on the water meter's target region. Experimental results indicate that, compared to other segmentation models, our model achieves an F1-score of 98.61\% and a mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) of 99.11\% for word wheel region segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the precise identification of water meter code words in the future.},

Next, the paper proposes a generative AI-based game design method that combines prompts confirmation, the setting of generated images, and user feedback optimization, aiming to enhance the aesthetic quality and interactivity of the game. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, this paper designs and implements an interview method and a questionnaire to collect data and find out the user experience of generative AI-generated graphic art style games. The experimental results show that generative AI not only significantly improves the efficiency of game design, but also allows for innovative graphics and element design.

The study observed measurable improvements in students' language proficiency, application ability, and critical thinking skills. Specifically, instant feedback from AI allowed them to refine the grammar, translation, writing and other language skills when they finish personalized learning and human-AI collaborative tasks. However, the survey also reveals technology dependency and insufficient evaluation criteria for AI-enabled tasks. To solve these problems, the author suggested to implement “human-AI collaboration” mode to concentrate on proper evaluation criteria, ethical education, and dynamic monitoring mechanisms. By doing so, it will be worthy data in English education and verify the unique value of GenAI in balancing college education with personalized cultivation.},

abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

The developments in haptic technology have significantly improved the human-computer interaction. Virtual reality (VR) technology and the metaverse, which highlight personalized experience, have become hotspots of the information application industry. In VR applications, adding haptic feedback to the human-computer interaction process can make the experience more immersive. In recent years, research on virtual haptics has focused on two areas: the use of microcurrents to stimulate mechanoreceptors and the use of virtual haptics to convey information. Multi-channel tactile-force rendering permits realistic touch sensations. This is achieved by utilizing force and tactile feedback methods. It is effective for the users to feel detailed and immersive interactions. This paper presents a detailed review on the developments in microcurrent-based computational frameworks for high-resolution haptic feedback. This work also investigates the modern techniques for high resolution haptic rendering, such as the role of multi-channel simulation and computational modeling techniques. Furthermore, the applications of this technology, challenges, and future directions were elaborated.},

abstract = {In this study, a rapid, accurate and intelligent method for detecting pesticide residues was developed by sensor arrays fused from surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectra of various substrates combined with deep learning. First, spectral data of pesticide residues were collected using conventional substrates with various morphologies. Then, the sensor array is acquired using different fusion methods on the spectral data, specifically concatenation and parallel methods. Finally, the intelligent and precise detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat is implemented in a regression model constructed through the sensor array combined with machine learning and deep learning. In this experiment, the lowest detection limits for chlormequat chloride and paraquat detected are 0.03 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L, respectively. The regression model which was constructed using the sensor arrays obtained from the concatenation fusion method combined with the MobileNet obtained the best prediction results, with the coefficients of determination of prediction of 0.9865 and 0.9846 for chlormequat chloride and paraquat, and root-mean-square errors of prediction of 0.2254 and 0.0174, respectively. Overall, the method we proposed achieves rapid, intelligent and accurate detection of chlormequat chloride and paraquat, with the advantages of low cost and simple operation, which has great application potential in trace detection of pesticide residues.},

We propose MIG-COW, a novel adversarial attack framework that generates highly generalizable and visually imperceptible adversarial examples. By combining momentum-integrated gradients with a consensus-orthogonal decomposition, MIG-COW captures both shared and model-specific vulnerabilities across heterogeneous CNN and ViT detectors. On the AADD-2025 Challenge benchmarks, MIG-COW achieves a 99.96\% white-box attack success rate (ASR) with high perceptual similarity (SSIM), significantly outperforming existing baselines. However, its limited 7.16\% ASR against official black-box targets-despite achieving the best overall score-highlights the ongoing challenge of transferability. We also demonstrate that incorporating low-performing but diverse models in the ensemble can degrade attack effectiveness, underscoring the need for careful surrogate model selection in real-world adversarial settings.},

abstract = {The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has opened up new frontiers in computational law. An exciting area of development is the use of AI to automate the deductive rule-based reasoning inherent in statutory and contract law. This paper argues that such automated deductive legal reasoning can now be viewed from the lens of software engineering, treating LLMs as interpreters of natural-language programs with natural-language inputs. We show how it is possible to apply principled software engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven legal reasoning of complex statutes and to unlock new applications in automated meta-reasoning such as mutation-guided example generation and metamorphic property-based testing.},

Generative AI (Gen-AI) and immersive technologies offer promising tools, but little is known about how to design them effectively for cultural learning. My research explores how Gen-AI can support cultural revitalisation through interactive, emotionally resonant systems. I design and evaluate immersive learning experiences, such as voice-based storytelling and guided procedural tasks, using Gen-AI agents to personalise narratives and adapt to user input. Through user studies, I examine how these systems affect engagement, cultural reflection, and cognitive load. Looking ahead, my dissertation investigates how Gen-AI influences identity, bias, and social perception in cultural contexts. This work contributes design insights for building more inclusive, reflective, and culturally responsive AI systems.},

It specifically analyzes the moderating role of trust in the relationship between technology-task fit (TTF) and acceptance, and the mediating role of intention to use between perceived usefulness and acceptance. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey from 352 valid respondents, covering core variables: TTF, trust level, perceived usefulness, intention to use, and acceptance. Statistical methods including reliability tests, correlation analysis, and regression analysis were employed to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that trust significantly enhances the positive effect of TTF on acceptance. Furthermore, intention to use partially mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and acceptance, explaining 43.05\% of the total effect. High reliability was confirmed for all variables, and correlation results supported the theoretical framework. The findings conclude that trust level and intention to use act as crucial moderator and mediator, respectively, in the acceptance process of generative AI tools, with TTF and perceived usefulness being key determinants of acceptance. This research offers significant insights for promoting the application of generative AI within academic publishing.},

One possible application set to transform social interactions is the use of generative speech to power AI agents that can realistically represent people. Our work examines the potential implications of AI agents representing individuals in human conversations ("agent representation") as a way to begin filling this research gap. We take a multi-method approach, conducting formative interviews with developers, a co-design workshop with designers, a harm analysis among researchers, and interviews with the general public. Both technologists and potential users worry adopting agent representations might harm the quality, trust, and autonomy of human communication. Potential users are particularly concerned that agent representations could undermine the value of social interaction and threaten individuals’ ability to control their image. To avoid such potential consequences, future genAI-powered agents and speech applications should take into account user-defined red lines when considering applying these technologies in social settings.},

Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration.

To evaluate this, we examined the first wave of experimental studies comparing human and GenAI-prompted creative idea generation by conducting a meta-analysis of 17 studies comprising 115 effect sizes. The results showed a small but non-significant pooled effect favoring GenAI. Initial analyses suggested greater originality in GenAI ideas, but sensitivity analysis showed this was driven by a few studies with very large effects. No significant differences were found between human ideas and those generated by prompting specific GenAI models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Funnel plots and asymmetry tests indicated no evidence of publication bias, supporting the findings’ validity. This meta-analysis finds no empirical support suggesting that GenAI has surpassed humans in creative idea generation. We discuss sociotechnical and sociocultural approaches as crucial for shaping human and artificial creativity.},

As a result, we developed Creat’AI — a GenAI-powered tangible prototype that co-creates original stories with children. We evaluated Creat’AI in a school with 17 children from the 1st grade. Our preliminary findings show that children were engaged in the activities and understood AI’s capability to generate original content, and changed their previous perception of AI and recognized that AI-generated content can be inaccurate. These results highlight the prototype’s potential in promoting AI literacy, contributing to the responsible and informed use of AI by young children.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users’ rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.},

abstract = {Evolutionary computation (EC) is a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) for optimization. However, traditional EC algorithms require the careful design of parameters and/or operators from experts. Designing an operator with generalization ability is a tough task, and the manually design process is often limited by the structures of existing operators, which lacks diversity. In order to explore operators with diverse structures and good generalization ability so as to provide inspiration for the manually design of operators, this paper proposes a generative EC approach for the automatic design of operators by using genetic programming (GP). We apply the generative approach to a typical EC variant named gene targeting differential evolution (GTDE), so as to propose a new automatic GTDE (AGTDE) algorithm. The AGTDE utilizes the advantage of GP in optimizing structural features to automatically generate and refine the targeting vector generation operator within GTDE. This way, the operator of AGTDE is generated automatically rather than manually designed, which is more robust and optimal. The experimental results demonstrate that AGTDE is capable of identifying appropriate and even better operator for solving optimization problems, when compared with GTDE with manually design operator. Moreover, the results show that the operator obtained for one problem can be applied to other problems and obtain promising results, which reflect the robustness and generalization ability of the operator generated by GP. Therefore, this generative approach may provide some novel avenues of thought for the automatically design of EC algorithm operators.},

abstract = {Advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are resulting in AI-generated media output that is (nearly) indistinguishable from human-created content. This can drastically impact users and the media sector, especially given global risks of misinformation. While the currently discussed European AI Act aims at addressing these risks through Article 52’s AI transparency obligations, its interpretation and implications remain unclear. In this early work, we adopt a participatory AI approach to derive key questions based on Article 52’s disclosure obligations. We ran two workshops with researchers, designers, and engineers across disciplines (N=16), where participants deconstructed Article 52’s relevant clauses using the 5W1H framework. We contribute a set of 149 questions clustered into five themes and 18 sub-themes. We believe these can not only help inform future legal developments and interpretations of Article 52, but also provide a starting point for Human-Computer Interaction research to (re-)examine disclosure transparency from a human-centered AI lens.},

abstract = {This one day workshop will explore the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in design research and practice. Generative technologies are developing rapidly and many designers are using them. Yet, there remains little published work on the use of GenAI in design. Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.},

abstract = {In this third installment of our GenAI workshop series at DIS, we focus on ‘stopsigns’—the blockages that impede progress in design research with GenAI. These stopsigns manifest as both semantic barriers (political, social, or mental frameworks) and pragmatic hurdles (technical limitations or implementation challenges) that persist despite the rapid advancements since the GenAI boom. Such stopsigns present a productive tension—they often contain partial truths worthy of consideration while simultaneously being shortsighted in ways that prevent progression. From blanket rejection to uncritical acceptance, these barriers affect how meaningfully we engage with GenAI’s potential. Our workshop welcomes both returning and first-time participants to share their experiences with these persistent challenges and work together to develop practical solutions. Through analysis of real cases and hands-on activities, we’ll build strategies for moving beyond these obstacles while acknowledging their legitimate concerns. Our goal is to foster more thoughtful integration of GenAI in design research and practice.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of education by offering new possibilities for personalized and experiential learning along with data-driven insights. The advancement in AI to Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has made the tables turn notably in the field of education. Generative AI application tool ChatGPT is emerging as a game changer offering personalized learning experiences by analyzing huge amounts of student data, generating study materials and pacing to individual needs. Intelligent educational tools powered by AI provide personalized guidance and feedback, adapting to curriculum to address knowledge gaps. GAI also automates the grading process, providing instant feedback and relieving teachers for qualitative assessments. This research paper offers a thorough examination of the potential uses, advantages, difficulties, and moral issues related to implementing ChatGPT in educational contexts. The authors closely analyze how ChatGPT can improve educational experiences, assist personalized learning, and encourage student- teacher interaction, while exploring the drawbacks of using generative AI models in education, such as concerns about bias, data privacy, and over-reliance on technology. This research article intends to offer educators \&amp; academicians useful insights into the usage of ChatGPT in the educational field through a critical analysis of the existing literature and real- world experiences.},

abstract = {Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.},

However, we lack an understanding of how UX practitioners, UX teams, and companies actually utilize GenAI and what challenges they face. We conducted interviews with 24 UX practitioners from multiple companies and countries, with varying roles and seniority. Our findings include: 1) There is a significant lack of GenAI company policies, with companies informally advising caution or leaving the responsibility to individual employees; 2) UX teams lack team-wide GenAI practices. UX practitioners typically use GenAI individually, favoring writing-based tasks, but note limitations for design-focused activities, like wireframing and prototyping; 3) UX practitioners call for better training on GenAI to enhance their abilities to generate effective prompts and evaluate output quality. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for GenAI integration in the UX sector.},

In response to calls for countering ableist narratives of lessening burdens and challenging normative norms that favor neurotypical individuals in prior research, we use interviews (n = 19) to center neurodivergent higher-education students’ accounts related to the use, motivation, and vision for LLM-based GenAI tools in academia. While students found the tools helpful, their experiences revealed challenges with integration into tried-and-tested workflows, limited AI literacy support, experimentation, and flattening personality. Drawing on crip time, we illustrate how GenAI tools can reinforce the normative value of productivity, shifting the burden of access-making onto students themselves. We propose three design values, flexibility, adaptability, and self-authenticity, to reimagine GenAI as a partner rather than a tool prioritizing speed and self-sufficiency.},

These developments are analyzed within the broader context of how computing can simultaneously exacerbate and alleviate crises, arguing that GenAI exposes deep institutional and economic tensions in creative industries.},

By analyzing the demands of teachers and students, a resource optimization model centered on the trinity collaboration of "teacher - GenAI - student" is proposed. Teaching resources are scientifically divided, and a four-step dynamic process of "data collection - demand transformation - resource generation - application iteration" is designed. Taking the "Obstacle Avoidance Design of Intelligent Logistics Robots" project of the Python course in higher vocational education as a case for practical verification, the results show that students' mastery rate of sensor principles, code debugging efficiency, and ability of cross-scenario knowledge transfer have all improved. This model has achieved the transformation of teaching resources from supply-driven to demand-led by precisely matching the needs of teachers and students and dynamically optimizing the supply of resources, providing theoretical support and practical paths for the construction of the human-machine collaborative education ecosystem.},

Together, we co-designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms. Alongside four community-driven and iterative workshops with entrepreneurs across five months, we conducted interviews with 15 local entrepreneurs and community providers. We detail the importance of communal and supportive exposure to generative AI tools for local entrepreneurs, scaffolding actionable use (and supporting non-use), demystifying generative AI technologies by emphasizing entrepreneurial power, while simultaneously deconstructing the veneer of simplicity to address the many operational skills needed for successful application.},

In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

In traditional education, teachers often spend a lot of time preparing lessons, because students have varying levels of proficiency, teachers need to consider whether the teaching content is suitable for everyone. Generative AI provides an effective solution to this problem by automatically generating personalized, high-quality educational content, which not only alleviates the burden on teachers but also enhances students' learning outcomes. This study focuses on a novel deep generative model—a framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and the self-attention mechanism (Transformer). We propose a model called the Hyperspherical Variational Self-Attention Autoencoder (HVSAE), which aims to generate personalized learning content based on students' learning situations, thereby reducing the burden on teachers and improving learning outcomes. The experimental results indicate that the model can generate high-quality educational resources, providing important support for achieving more personalized and efficient education.},

The quantitative data showed a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically significant. However, the qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of familiarity with generative AI, along with a strong desire to learn more. Qualitative findings also show that although Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not significantly enhance participants’ trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.

abstract = {Higher-order thinking skills in global education are becoming more and more important. With the launch of ChatGPT, the potential of chatbots in education has been widely explored. However, the impact of chatbot-assisted learning on higher-order thinking skills is not yet known. In this study, a chatbot named C4D Helper was developed by using Coze, a chatbot creation platform in China like Google's Dialogflow. A chatbot-assisted learning model was designed based on the Design Thinking framework to cultivate students' higher-order thinking skills. In order to examine the effectiveness of this model, a pre-posttest quasi-experiment lasting for 5 weeks was conducted. The students in two classes, majoring in Digital Media Technology at Kashi University, were randomly assigned to control group(CG, n=31) and experimental group (EG, n=31). Students in CG learned by traditional teaching model while students in EG learned by chatbot-assisted learning model. The results showed that the chatbot-assisted learning model can significantly improve higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creative thinking, and cooperation skills.},

abstract = {Digital twins are essential visualization applications in the manufacturing field. However, their development requires specialized 3D engineers, which often complicates modifications during the operation stage. To address this complexity, we introduce FactoryDecoder, a development tool for non-expert users in 3D engineering to generate and modify digital twins using natural language inputs. FactoryDecoder converts users' descriptions of production line into hierarchical asset codes, facilitating the automated layout and simplified modification of digital twins. Furthermore, if the system finds that the 3D asset library lacks appropriate device representations, it will automatically use a 3D mesh generator to create new ones. We evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) to optimize FactoryDecoder's capabilities. Preliminary user studies highlight FactoryDecoder's effectiveness.},

abstract = {Technology-mediated communication tools are widely used to maintain connections between older adults and their remote family members. However, challenges often arise due to differences in their life rhythms and communication preferences, such as time zones, daily routines, or preferred platforms. To address these challenges, we propose using Ditto, a mimetic embodied agent, in video-call-like interactions between an older adult and a remote family member. When direct interaction is difficult, FamilyDitto can represent either party, providing a strong social presence and a personalized experience to the other person. To explore the potential of Ditto in supporting intergenerational communication, we conducted seven co-design workshops (n=27) with older adults and younger family members. Our thematic analysis reveals Ditto's potential roles as both a temporal bridge and an emotional proxy, identifies the tension between faithful and idealized representations, and emphasizes the importance of personalization to support unique family dynamics. We distill our findings into implications for designing mediated semi-synchronous communication, using idealized representation responsibly, and addressing the asymmetric motivations and comfort levels with Ditto across roles and ages. This study provides a foundation for mimetic AI technologies that enhance, rather than replace, human connection in remote intergenerational relationships.},

Unlike existing literature that predominantly focuses on North America, Europe, or Asia, this research shifts the lens to Latin America. Adopting a qualitative approach, the study gathered data through 26 semi-structured interviews with higher education institution decision-makers (9), academic (14), and administrative staff (3), revealing the landscape of ChatGPT adoption and application. The findings show a varied level of ChatGPT adoption across different functions within these institutions, with no apparent contextual differences. While academic staff show a higher level of engagement for enhancing educational and research processes, administrative staff use it to perform day-to-day activities, such as improving writing. The role of ChatGPT in decision-making and transformative policies remains limited. Despite recognizing the potential of ChatGPT to enhance education, decision-makers often mention challenges like discerning between human and artificial intelligence-generated content, fostering critical thinking, and addressing student inequalities. Decision-makers agree on the importance of training to tackle these challenges. The study seeks to help develop a strategic agenda for integrating technologies, such as ChatGPT, in Latin American universities.},

This study explores the behavioral characteristics and text generation quality of college students when using generative AI tools, and proposes an integrated research framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), cluster analysis, and regression models. This study uses 200 students from a university in Guangdong as the research dataset, uses the BERT model to quantify the fluency, relevance, and creativity of generated texts, and uses the K-means algorithm to classify students' behaviors into three categories: high-frequency learners, low-frequency casual users, and mixed users. The experimental results show that the text quality under different task types is significantly different. For example, the scenarios of writing summary generation and creative writing are different. The summary generation task has the highest score in relevance (90 points), while the creative writing task performs well in creativity (85 points). Subsequent regression analysis found that professional background and technical attitude are key factors affecting behavioral patterns. Students of science and engineering tend to frequently use generative AI tools for complex tasks, while students of humanities pay more attention to language fluency and creativity.},

abstract = {The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.},

abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45\% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11\% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

This paper proposes a different view: prompts function as cognitive interfaces that mediate between user intent and algorithmic generation. Integrating theories of external cognition, interface semiotics, and pragmatist theories of situated inquiry, the paper provides a theoretical framing of prompting along three interrelated dimensions: semantic projection, compositional structuring, and interpretive negotiation. Through an empirical vignette from branding communication, I show how prompting can be seen as a dynamic representational activity, deeply embedded in cognitive processes of exploration, articulation, and iterative refinement. By reframing the prompt as a site of cognitive labor rather than as a static interface, this expands our understanding of interaction with generative AI as epistemic, semiotic, and situated.},

RAG extends the capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, without the need to retrain the model. On the other hand, Fine-Tuning approach updates LLM weights with domain-specific data to improve performance on specific tasks. The fine-tuned model is particularly effective to systematically learn new comprehensive knowledge in a specific domain that is not covered by the LLM pre-training. This tutorial walks through the RAG and Fine-Tuning techniques, discusses the insights of their advantages and limitations, and provides best practices of adopting the methodologies for the LLM tasks and use cases. The hands-on labs demonstrate the advanced techniques to optimize the RAG and fine-tuned LLM architecture that handles domain specific LLM tasks.

Through interviews with 20 blind screen reader users who use various GenAI applications for diverse tasks, we show how they approached information access with everyday uncertainty, or a mindset of skepticism and criticality towards both AI- and human-mediated assistance as well as information itself. Instead of expecting information to be ‘correct’ and ‘complete’, participants extracted cues from error-prone information sources; treated all information as tentative; acknowledged and explored information subjectivity; and constantly adjusted their expectations and strategies considering the politics around access. The concept of everyday uncertainty situates GenAI tools among the interconnected assistive applications, humans, and sociomaterial conditions that both enable and hinder the ongoing production of access. We discuss the implications of everyday uncertainty for future design and research.},

abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.},

abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

abstract = {Image-related privacy preservation techniques often demand significant technical expertise, creating a barrier for end-users. We present a privacy-focused intelligent image manipulation tool that leverages recent advancements in generative AI to lower this barrier. Our functional prototype allows users to express their privacy concerns, identify potential privacy risks in images, and recommends relevant AI-powered obfuscation techniques to mitigate these risks and concerns. We demonstrate the tool’s versatility across multiple different domains, showcasing its potential to empower users in managing their privacy across various contexts. This demonstration presents the concept, user workflow, and implementation details of our prototype, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between privacy research and practical, user-facing tools for privacy-preserving image sharing.},

abstract = {Fostering students’ interests in learning is considered to have many positive downstream effects. Large language models have opened up new horizons for generating content tuned to one’s interests, yet it is unclear in what ways and to what extent this customization could have positive effects on learning. To explore this novel dimension, we conducted a between-subjects online study (n=272) featuring different variations of a generative AI vocabulary learning app that enables users to personalize their learning examples. Participants were randomly assigned to control (sentence sourced from pre-existing text) or experimental conditions (generated sentence or short story based on users’ text input). While we did not observe a difference in learning performance between the conditions, the analysis revealed that generative AI-driven context personalization positively affected learning motivation. We discuss how these results relate to previous findings and underscore their significance for the emerging field of using generative AI for personalized&nbsp;learning.},

To the end of computing within this crisis, we situate an in-situ experiment with LLMs in a specific, specialized form of research, namely systematic literature review. Contrary to other studies in this domain, we argue that the question of LLM integration in systematic reviews cannot be fully addressed by measuring how well LLMs replicate the labor of human researchers. It is crucial to examine the epistemological implications of how LLMs are integrated into the process. To explore this, we conducted a systematic literature review, situated within the humanities and social sciences, using two different LLM products: a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a purpose-specific tool (Elicit). We analyze how our two exemplar implementations influence the review process and what this reveals about the cognitive and epistemological effects of LLMs in research, drawing on a conceptual vocabulary of focusing on notions of bullshit and nonconscious cognition.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

abstract = {The richness of the information in photos can often threaten privacy, thus image editing methods are often employed for privacy protection. Existing image privacy protection techniques, like blurring, often struggle to maintain the balance between robust privacy protection and preserving image usability. To address this, we introduce a generative content replacement (GCR) method in image privacy protection, which seamlessly substitutes privacy-threatening contents with similar and realistic substitutes, using state-of-the-art generative techniques. Compared with four prevalent image protection methods, GCR consistently exhibited low detectability, making the detection of edits remarkably challenging. GCR also performed reasonably well in hindering the identification of specific content and managed to sustain the image’s narrative and visual harmony. This research serves as a pilot study and encourages further innovation on GCR and the development of tools that enable human-in-the-loop image privacy protection using approaches similar to GCR.},

It puts forward a journey from March 2023 to January 2025; the researcher (as artist/artist as a researcher) examines how generative artificial intelligence tools, including ChatGPT and MidJourney, reignited a passion for looser (imperfect) art practice. This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel agentic AI system called XPF, which enables users to create "agents" using just natural language, where each agent is capable of executing complex, real-world business workflows in an accurate and reliable manner. XPF provides an interface to develop and iterate over the agent creation process and then deploy the agent in production when satisfactory results are produced consistently. The key components of XPF include: (a) planner, which leverages LLM to generate a step-by-step plan, which can further be edited by a human (b) compiler, which leverages LLM to compile the plan into a flow graph (c) executor, which handles distributed execution of the flow graph (using LLM, tools, RAG, etc.) on an underlying cluster and (d) verifier, which helps in verification of the output (through human generated tests or auto-generated tests using LLM). We develop five different agents using XPF and conduct experiments to evaluate one particular aspect i.e. difference in accuracy and reliability of the five agents with "human-generated" vs "auto-generated" plans. Our experiments show that we can get much more accurate and reliable response for a business workflow when step-by-step instructions (in natural language) are given by a human familiar with the workflow, rather than letting the LLM figure out the execution plan steps. In particular, we observe that "human-generated" plan almost always gives 100\% accuracy whereas "auto-generated" plan almost never gives 100\% accuracy. In terms of reliability, we observe through Rouge-L, Blue and Meteor scores, that the output from "human-generated" plan is much more reliable than "auto-generated" plan.},

This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

abstract = {People with temporary disabilities encounter access barriers at work, yet often face additional challenges when selecting accessibility technologies to address their access needs: tools may require time, training, or long-term commitment that does not align with the uncertain nature of their disability&nbsp;[34]. Compared to people with permanent or chronic conditions, they are less likely to adapt&nbsp;[44] or adopt customized, expensive solutions&nbsp;[34], despite the possibility that their disability may become permanent&nbsp;[4, 46]. Broadly available generative AI (GAI) tools are increasingly recognized for their potential as a tool to support on-demand access for work and education&nbsp;[21] across a range of disabilities. This experience report presents a reflection on the author’s use of multimodal GAI as a low-barrier, rapid access tool during a temporary disability– addressing access needs that arose during an illness and impacted verbal communication, visual processing, and manual dexterity in both work and research tasks. The use of GAI to address these temporary access barriers reveals conflicting priorities in adoption and utility, and surfaces tensions between meeting immediate needs and navigating the uncertain, and sometimes unintended, continued use of these tools over time.},

Whilst previous research has focused on GenAI's emerging role in artistic work, our study highlights its potential in supporting non-creative aspects of artistic practice, which are often overlooked yet critical for workload management of disabled artists. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 5 disabled visual artists, we explore the perceived benefits and barriers of using GenAI, particularly in terms of accessibility, cognitive demands, ethical concerns, and financial constraints. Our findings suggest that whilst GenAI can increase productivity, reduce cognitive load, and promote equity, it also presents challenges related to transparency, bias, interface complexity, and job displacement fears. We conclude by calling for more inclusive and affordable GenAI tools, improved accessible interfaces, ethical governance, and personalised support to enable disabled creatives in their professional practices.},

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

abstract = {Generative AI tools are increasingly embedded in creative workflows, yet their outputs often misalign with user expectations, producing results that are ambiguous, contradictory, or oddly off-mark. Rather than treating such misalignments as failures to be corrected, this paper reframes them as sources of creative ambiguity and cognitive tension. Drawing on theories of cognitive dissonance, frame conflict, and prediction error, I show how these tensions can catalyze reflection, reinterpretation, and creative reframing. Through five cross-modal cases spanning writing, design, music, code, and prototyping I demonstrate how creative ambiguity and cognitive tension function as generative forces in human–AI interaction. This work contributes to HCI and creativity support by proposing a shift from optimization toward reflection, designing not to minimize friction, but to work with it.},

abstract = {Chinese martial arts are deeply rooted in the traditional culture of the Chinese nation. Throughout its historical development, it has accumulated a profound historical heritage and formed its unique cultural value. The technological innovation of generative artificial intelligence provides a new path for the modernization transformation of Chinese martial arts culture. This study proposes a framework for Chinese martial arts cultural products based on generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction. By combining deep learning models (such as GANs, Transformers) with blockchain and AR/VR technology, five applications were designed: technology-enabled martial arts digital products, martial arts interactive short videos, martial arts motion capture systems, martial arts education platforms, and martial arts virtual experience halls. These applications were evaluated and validated from the dimensions of user experience and market potential. Experimental results show that martial arts cultural products under generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction have good user experience and positive market prospects, providing theoretical and practical reference for the deep integration of martial arts culture and intelligent technology.},

abstract = {This paper contributes a first-person exploration on AI video-to-video technologies, which I call "Generative Rotoscoping". This includes: insights on the creation process, a set of prototype explorations, and an integrated workflow for multi-modal video generation. Generative video is rapidly evolving and delivering higher quality outputs. While video generation models have potential for film-making and content creation, they lack controllability for creative expression: viable videos can require hundreds of unsuccessful attempts. To understand this emergent practice, and due to the constant evolution of models and limited number of early adopters, I explored Generative Rotoscoping over 12 months and created AI workflows leading to over 40,000 video/image files examining a variety of models and techniques including: structural guidance, frame consistency, image referencing and masks, compositing, among others. Insights from this work can serve as a starting point for designing the next generation of video authoring tools.},

abstract = {With the rapid development and release of generative AI (genAI) applications, policy discourses primarily take place on an expert level. Little space is given to laypeople – who have to adapt to and adopt the genAI innovations – to share their opinions and experiences. Addressing this gap, we organized 6h/3.5h laypeople dialogues in Nigeria, Japan, and Germany in July and August 2024. During the dialogues, participants discussed what a desirable future in light of genAI development could look like in one of three contexts: education, public service, and arts \&amp; culture. Participants explored the consequences of technology deployment, assessed the risks, mapped stakeholders, and derived measures to achieve a desirable goal. This study contributes to policy debates on genAI by providing recommendations derived from participants’ identified requirements and suggested measures for genAI to create value and to foster a socially desirable future. We reflect on the results through a cross-national lens.},

We investigate how AI-driven image-generation techniques can empower creatives to explore a variety of visual design possibilities for individual and groups of characters. Informed by interviews with character designers, Paratrouper is a multi-modal system that enables creating and experimenting with multiple permutations for character casts and visualizing them in various contexts as part of a holistic approach to design. We demonstrate how Paratrouper supports different aspects of the character design process, and share insights from its use by eight creators. Our work highlights the interplay between creative agency and serendipity, as well as the visual interrelationships among character aesthetics.},

abstract = {Left-Behind Children (LBC) refers to children who lack daily companionship due to their parents working away from home, accounting for approximately one-fifth of all children in China. Due to the lack of communication and emotional support from their parents, LBCs often experience physical and mental health issues. Effective communication is usually limited by time and topics, and the format of mobile devices and video calls is not always suitable. To address this issue, we developed the Accompany Sleep system. Parents upload daily life content through the app, and the system uses ChatGPT4o to create bedtime stories projected to the LBC. To explore the role of Accompany Sleep in family mediation, we conducted a one-month user study involving four families. The results of the study indicated that both parents and children exhibited positive behaviors, the parent-child relationship was effectively strengthened, and GenAI played a crucial role in this process. Based on these findings, this paper discusses how Accompany Sleep facilitated behavioral changes and improved parent-child relationships while expanding the application of GenAI in the family domain.},

abstract = {Software development activities must adhere to industry, national, and/or international regulatory standards to ensure security, safety, and other important properties in high-stakes, regulated domains, such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. These software standards are often codified via multiple documents, ranging from specific requirements to general guidance. Software developers must demonstrate—and regulatory authorities must then verify—the completeness and consistency between the software artifacts and the software regulatory documents. Detecting regulatory document incompleteness, inconsistencies, and/or discrepancies (DIID) with respect to software artifacts is important for both developers and regulators because they indicate potential non-conformance and/or software regulatory risk.DIID detection is currently a human-intensive activity where people learn the standards and then review or search software artifacts to find or detect potential issues. This tedious and error-prone manual process is even more challenging with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that create frequent software updates. In addition, software artifacts (such as requirements or architecture documents) and software standards also change as the software is maintained, requiring ongoing manual reviews and revisions.Generative AI can accelerate DIID detection for different documents and data sources. This paper explores how generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), can accelerate DIID detection in software artifacts, particularly when comparing trusted documents like safety standards with software development artifacts. Integrating LLMs into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to detect DIID can improve specific development activities, as well as enable transformative opportunities by accelerating end-to-end SDLC workflows and regulatory compliance. Current LLM benchmarks and testing frameworks do not sufficiently test for detecting DIID and require extension to adequately and consistently detect DIID across multiple SDLC activities. This position paper describes how LLMs can accelerate software assurance processes and ensure greater compliance with industry standards and government regulatory requirements.},

This work presents an architecture called DoME, which relies on natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to trigger changes in the domain models and self-adaptation techniques to update the models at runtime. It is instantiated in a concrete architecture using a chatbot in Telegram and Transformers Libraries for NLP. The architecture has been preliminary evaluated regarding its assertiveness and user satisfaction, resulting in an 82.55\% hit rate and confirming that NL provides good usability and facilitates data manipulation.},

With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.},

This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68\% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

The technological framework employs AR for dynamic artifact interaction and in situ navigation, while VR capabilities facilitate virtual tours, broadening access for individuals with disabilities or those from distant geographies or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Gamification transforms educational content into interactive experiences, fostering deeper engagement and learning. Moreover, aligning with the mission of museum institutions for cultural heritage preservation, a module for digital conservation and reconstruction was developed resorting to photogrammetry-based approaches. This module aims to create a virtual catalog accessible to both experts and the general public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools automate tasks such as generating thematic quizzes for gamification and cataloging scanned artifacts. The system aims to improve the interpretative and educational potential of museum exhibits, modernizing visitor engagement while preserving the integrity of physical artifacts and spaces. Its continuous evolution aims to bridge traditional forms of cultural preservation and promotion with contemporary digital interaction techniques, leveraged from cost-effective publicly accessible edge technologies.},

abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

abstract = {This study analyzed how students used generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in collaborative problem solving. We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

The purpose of this paper is to derive significant behavioral sequence characteristics by coding and recording the actual video of generative artificial intelligence classrooms and analyzing the classroom interaction behaviors using lag sequence analysis. The study shows that the teacher-student interaction in the generative artificial intelligence classroom is more active, and the students' active participation in the classroom is very high, which will further promote the generative artificial intelligence classroom and realize the deep integration of the new technology and the classroom.},

We assessed the ability of GAI, specifically the GPT class of models, at automatically coding discourse in the context of a learning analytics study using a variety of prompting and training strategies. We found that fine-tuning approaches produced the best results; however, no results achieved standard thresholds for reliability in our field.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

This study introduces GAI into the course learning process of vocational college students, and conducts coding analysis on the discourse types, questioning levels, and questioning strategies of students and GAI, exploring how students in vocational colleges can collaborate with GAI in classroom learning. Research has found that in conversations between students and GAI, students are the initiators of the conversation, with a majority of dialogue units consisting of individual conversations and fewer ongoing discussions. The cognitive level of students' questioning is relatively low, with knowledge and understanding levels being the main focus. The questioning strategy is single, and there are significant differences in the dialogue between students with different usage experiences and GAI. On this basis, this study provides effective suggestions for further introducing generative artificial intelligence in classroom teaching from three aspects: providing questioning training, enriching questioning scenarios, and strengthening reflection on answers.},

abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

abstract = {In the field of education, generative artificial intelligence is gradually becoming a key force to promote educational innovation and intelligent development. This technology simulates the process of human creation, generates innovative and practical teaching content, and provides a strong technical support for personalized teaching. For rural education with relatively scarce resources, the application of generative artificial intelligence is expected to solve the problem of educational inequity and improve the quality of teaching. However, rural education still faces many challenges, such as resource shortage and information block, which limit the effective application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education. This study deeply analyzes the application status and advantages of generative artificial intelligence in rural teaching, reveals the main problems and difficulties encountered by rural teachers in the process of use, and puts forward targeted solutions, in order to promote the optimal application of generative artificial intelligence in rural education and promote the development of rural education in a fairer and smarter direction.},

abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

There has been a recent rise in the usage and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as ChatGPT especially with its ability to mimic human behavior. In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

In this paper, we construct the ‘AIGC-DRIVE’ dynamic closed-loop model to explain the role of AIGC in the innovation of platform economy content production and marketing strategy, and carry out efficiency comparison, AB test of AIGC advertisement strategy, and research on users' privacy concerns, as well as combining with the typical case studies of Jitterbug and SHEIN. It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

However, although we know that AI in general poses both risks and opportunities for people with disabilities, little is known specifically about GAI in particular. To address this, we conducted a three-month autoethnography of our use of GAI to meet personal and professional needs as a team of researchers with and without disabilities. Our findings demonstrate a wide variety of potential accessibility-related uses for GAI while also highlighting concerns around verifiability, training data, ableism, and false promises.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

abstract = {Improving undergraduate students' ability to cope with cyber risks is one of the key issues to be addressed in the digital transformation of higher education in the era of generative artificial intelligence. In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},
