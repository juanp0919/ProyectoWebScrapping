Qualitative methods have proved to be an important tool to understand the social, cultural, political and emotional complexities of these accusatory dynamics. This methodological commentary examines tendencies and challenges when such qualitative studies are conducted on social media. It relies on a structured literature review (n=60) and on the authors’ own experiences from 15 years of qualitatively researching blame on social media during various outbreaks of diseases. Four main considerations emerge. First, the overreliance on X (formerly Twitter), explained by this platform’s data availability, offers limited materials to conduct in-depth qualitative analysis. Second, traditional qualitative approaches tend to be transposed to social media, in a manner that may neglect the specificities of this data. Third, the analyzed data is typically anonymized and decontextualized, due to ethical concerns and platform constraints. Finally, researchers often use methods bordering on quantitative processes. In light of these tendencies, we discuss broad considerations for future research.}

While many of these tools claim to offer therapeutic advice, their unregulated status and lack of systematic evaluation create risks for users, particularly vulnerable individuals. This viewpoint article highlights the urgent need for a standardized framework to assess and demonstrate the safety, ethics, and evidence basis of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts. Drawing on clinical expertise, research, co-design experience, and the World Health Organization’s guidance, the authors propose key evaluation criteria: adherence to ethical principles, evidence-based responses, conversational skills, safety protocols, and accessibility. Implementation challenges, including setting output criteria without one “right answer,” evaluating multiturn conversations, and involving experts for oversight at scale, are explored. The authors advocate for greater consumer engagement in chatbot evaluation to ensure that these tools address users’ needs effectively and responsibly, emphasizing the ethical obligation of developers to prioritize safety and a strong base in empirical evidence.}

Introduction
Chatbot Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), a multimodal generative AI, has been studied for potential applications in healthcare, including otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. In this study, authors investigates the consistency of ChatGPT-4o in analyzing clinical fiberoptic videos of suspected laryngeal malignancies compared to expert clinicians.
Methods
This experimental study involved twenty patients with primary laryngeal disease consulting at a tertiary academic center. Data, including laryngeal fiberoptic video examinations, were retrospectively analyzed using the ChatGPT-4o application programming interface. Responses were assessed for diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and clinical recommendations. Three otolaryngology-head and neck consultants independently evaluated ChatGPT-4o’s performance using the Artificial Intelligence Performance Instrument and a five-point Likert scale for complexity and consistency.
Results
ChatGPT-4o identified malignant diagnoses as the primary diagnosis in 30% of cases, while proposing malignancies as one of the top three diagnoses in 90% of cases. Despite high sensitivity, specificity was limited. The mean consistency score for image analysis was 2.36 ± 1.13, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.890 (P = 0.03). The model showed a tendency to prioritize text over visual data, limiting the improvement in diagnostic accuracy from video input.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT-4o demonstrates potential in analyzing laryngeal pathologies through multimodal data, current limitations in specificity and image interpretation indicate the need for further refinement. Ongoing advancements could enhance its integration into clinical workflows, supporting accurate diagnoses and decision-making in otolaryngology.}

In the study, a content analysis was conducted on the curriculum of 65 undergraduate tourism and hospitality management programs, followed by an analysis of data from 28 academics to explore the role of emerging technologies in the curriculum. We have observed six core topics. Technology courses had the lowest proportion. We further observe four categories of skills that emerging technologies may provide students, highlighting their potential to shape future career opportunities. Building on these findings, the current study contributes to the literature by linking these skill sets — digital and technological, theoretical, operational, and managerial — to emerging job roles such as virtual reality tour designers, competent tourism developers, and AI-driven marketing specialists. Furthermore, the study identifies the domains where emerging technologies have the most relevance and outlines which purpose they may be included in the tourism and hospitality curriculum as a course. Thus, it forwards previous studies emphasizing the importance of emerging technologies. The study also suggests the implications for the literature, practice, and public policies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Difficulty removing central venous ports in children is generally uncommon. We present a rare case of intraoperative difficulty with port removal that resulted in catheter breakage.
Case presentation
An 18-year-old girl presented for port removal nearly six years after placement. The catheter was stuck intraoperatively and despite increased tension, proximal dissection, and extraction attempts with a wire, a portion of the catheter broke off intravascularly. Since intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed that neither end of the catheter had free intravascular motion, the catheter was left in place. The patient has had no apparent complications from this retained portion of the catheter.
Conclusion
It is uncommon to have great difficulty removing a port in a child but in cases where the catheter is stuck, multiple techniques can be attempted intraoperatively to improve chances of removal. If the catheter breaks intraoperatively but has no free intravascular motion on fluoroscopy, it may be reasonable to leave the retained fragment in place and obtain interval imaging to ensure the fragment has not moved.}

abstract = {Introduction
ASSORT (AI-based Symptom Stratification in Ophthalmology for Rapid Triage) is a GPT-4-based triage tool designed to assess ophthalmic emergencies using a three-tier color-coded system. This study compares ASSORT to the Rescue triage method, using the ophthalmologist’s final assessment as the reference standard.
Materials and methods
A prospective study was conducted at the Créteil University Hospital from April to June 2024. Each patient underwent triage using ASSORT, followed by the Rescue triage method. Both tools used the same color-coding system to stratify severity: yellow for emergency cases, green for urgent cases, and white for non-urgent cases. An examining ophthalmologist in their final year of residency performed the final assessment. Concordance between the ophthalmologist and each of the tools was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, alongside precision and recall metrics.
Results
Fifty-one patients were included. Case severities were distributed as follows: 22/51 white, 27/51 green, and 2/51 yellow, with conjunctivitis (17.5 %) and corneal abrasions (12.5 %) being the two most common presentations. ASSORT demonstrated moderate agreement with the ophthalmologist (κ = 0.54), whereas Rescue showed stronger concordance (κ = 0.85). ASSORT tended to overestimate urgency, assigning more yellow codes than the ophthalmologist. McNemar’s test confirmed significant misclassification by ASSORT (p = 0.0156), while Rescue showed no significant deviation (p = 0.5).
Conclusion
While the small sample size limits generalizability, ASSORT shows potential for AI-driven ophthalmic triage but currently overestimates severity compared to the ophthalmologist. Further refinements such as reinforcement learning and multimodal input, as well as large-scale validation are needed to improve accuracy and reduce unnecessary emergency classifications before clinical implementation.}

A comparative approach is adopted, exploring student experiences at Zayed University (ZU) in the UAE and King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Saudi Arabia. The principal variables of interest, including Expected Benefits (EB), University Support (US), Ethical Awareness (EA), and Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), are examined, with particular attention to their direct and mediated influences through Behavioral Intention (BI) on student satisfaction (SS). Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using SmartPLS-4. The findings reveal notable similarities and differences between the two universities. At both ZU and KAU, BI demonstrated the strongest direct influence on SS, confirming its central role. EB and TSE significantly impacted SS both directly and indirectly through BI in both contexts, although their effects were stronger at KAU. Conversely, US and EA showed no significant direct or mediated effects on SS at either institution. R2 values indicated substantial explanatory power of the model, and Q2 values confirmed strong predictive relevance. These results suggest that while the core drivers (BI, EB, TSE) are consistent across contexts, institutional and cultural factors shape their relative impact. The findings highlight the importance of integrating GenAI tools into teaching practices and emphasize the role of student motivation, confidence, and institutional support in fostering effective adoption and enhancing learning experiences. Institutions should prioritize enhancing students' perceived benefits and technological self-efficacy by providing practical training and demonstrating the value of GenAI tools. These factors significantly influence student satisfaction and engagement, particularly in culturally distinct settings.}

The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have launched a partnership, funded by Wellcome, that explores regulation and evaluation of digital mental health technologies. This Viewpoint describes a series of key challenges across the regulatory and health technology assessment pathways and aims to facilitate discussions to ensure that approaches to regulation and evaluation are informed by patients, the public, and professionals working within mental health. We invite partners from across the mental health community to engage with, collaborate with, and provide scrutiny of this project to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
The research aims to unravel the dynamics of academic integrity in the ChatGPT era by analyzing critical predictors such as personal best goals (PBG), academic competence and workplace stress. Furthermore, it examines how ChatGPT adoption acts as a moderating factor, potentially influencing the relationship between these predictors and academic integrity, offering a nuanced understanding of its impact in academic settings.
Design/methodology/approach
Relying on the social cognitive theory, the authors adopt a quantitative approach through an online survey to explore the impact of key variables – PBG, academic competence and workplace stress, as well as ChatGPT adoption on integrity – by analyzing data from responses collected through Academic Social Networking Sites.
Findings
The study found that PBG related positively to academic integrity among academic staff. However, workplace stress had a negative impact on academic integrity, while academic competence failed to report any effect. With the integration of ChatGPT adoption as a moderator into the model, the authors found the association between PBG and academic integrity altered to be negative. The ChatGPT adoption-moderated interactions of academic competence and workplace stress on academic integrity were significant.
Practical implications
The findings suggest that institutions should provide training on the ethical and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT to ensure they support rather than hinder academic integrity. Additionally, organizations should focus on stress management initiatives and fostering a balanced approach to personal goal setting to mitigate the potential negative impacts of ChatGPT adoption on ethical behavior.
Originality/value
This attempt is both timely and pioneering, addressing a clear gap in the current body of literature. As limited studies have examined the role of ChatGPT in academic settings, this work stands out as one of the earliest to investigate how educators and researchers incorporate OpenAI tools into their professional practices.}

Duodenum inversum is a rare congenital anatomical variant and presents a myriad of clinical challenges. This case presentation highlights a unique case of symptomatic duodenum inversum diagnosed in the second decade of life requiring operative intervention.
Case presentation
We present the case of a thirteen-year-old male who presented with one year of intermittent abdominal pain with associated bilious emesis. Diagnostic work-up included multiple abdominal ultrasounds and abdominal radiographs which only revealed constipation. Despite adequate bowel regimen, patient's symptoms persisted. Duodenum inversum was diagnosed on a fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal study and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room to evaluate for concurrent midgut volvulus and malrotation. A diagnostic laparoscopy revealed fibrotic adhesive bands contributing to partial duodenal obstruction. Surgical resection of these bands alleviated the obstruction and resolved the patient's symptoms with no recurrence noted on post-operative follow-up.
Conclusion
In cases of duodenum inversum, recognition through diagnostic tools like fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal studies is critical. While initial medical management may suffice for mild cases, surgical intervention remains the cornerstone for severe cases, particularly when obstruction is evident, emphasizing the necessity of tailored approaches based on clinical severity.}

abstract = {Introduction
India accounts for 26 % of global tuberculosis (TB) cases, with delayed diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and drug resistance exacerbating disease transmission. Conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains time-consuming, while molecular tools like the Xpert MTB/RIF assay—though rapid—are limited to detecting MTB and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Testing for isoniazid (INH) and second-line drugs requires the costly Xpert MTB/XDR assay. Although line probe assays (LPAs) identifies first- and second-line drug resistance, their accessibility is restricted to specialized laboratories. This underscores the need for a rapid, cost-effective alternative to diagnose resistance to INH and fluoroquinolones (FQs).
Methods
A cross-sectional study was performed at the Department of Microbiology, AIIMS Bhubaneswar, and the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL), Cuttack, from March 2022 to April 2023. MTB isolates (n = 123) were analyzed using LPAs (Hain Lifescience's Genotype MTBDRplus and Genotype MTBDRsl) and multiplex allele-specific (MAS) PCR. The MAS-PCR targeted mutations in katG codon 315 and the inhA-15 promoter region for INH resistance, and gyrA codon 94 for FQ resistance.
Results
MAS-PCR identified INH resistance in 28/123 (22.76 %) isolates. Compared to LPA, MAS-PCR demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 80.77 %, 93.81 %, 77.78 %, 94.79 %, and 91.06 %, respectively, for INH resistance. For FQ resistance, MAS-PCR identified 19/123 (15.44 %) resistant isolates, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 87.50 %, 95.33 %, 73.68 %, 98.08 %, and 94.31 %, respectively, relative to LPA.
Conclusion
MAS-PCR offers a rapid, technically feasible, and cost-effective method for detecting resistance to INH and FQs. Its high accuracy and affordability position it as a viable alternative in resource-limited settings, facilitating timely TB diagnosis and resistance management.}

The objectives of this cross-sectional observational prospective study were to assess the inter-observer and inter-scanner variability of RRI and RPI and to determine whether operator experience influences measurement accuracy. RRI and RPI were measured in the left kidney of 10 client-owned dogs by four different operators with varying levels of experience, using two different ultrasound scanners. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two ultrasound scanners for both RRI and RPI were good to excellent in all four observers (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). Similarly, a good to excellent correlation coefficient was observed between the measurements of the four operators for both indices across each ultrasound scanner (ICC > 0.75 and p < 0.05). These findings indicate that RRI and RPI are feasible and reproducible measurements with good inter-scanner and inter-observer agreement, regardless of operator experience. However, achieving high reproducibility requires adequate training and the use of a standardized protocol with strict but adaptable settings tailored to each patient's characteristics.}

The main results show the following: Firstly, Chinese business confidence is negatively associated with supply chain pressure across all upper, middle, and lower quantiles, reflecting a homogenous adverse impact irrespective of the levels of both variables. Secondly, Chinese consumer confidence is impacted heterogeneously by the magnitude of supply chain pressure, indicating the relevance of the quantile distribution of both variables to their association. The results remain valid after applying a Wavelet Quantile Correlation approach, indicating their robustness. Our findings offer crucial insights to Chinese policymakers and other stakeholders, suggesting that Chinese businesses do not tolerate pressure in the global supply chain, whereas Chinese consumers tend to switch to local products and services during lapses in the global supply chain.}

abstract = {Background
Symptom checker apps (SCAs) are layperson-facing tools that advise on whether and where to seek care, or possible diagnoses. Previous research has primarily focused on evaluating the accuracy, safety, and usability of their recommendations. However, studies examining SCAs’ impact on clinical care, including the patient-physician interaction and satisfaction with care, remain scarce.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the effects of an SCA on satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction in acute care settings. Additionally, we examined its influence on patients’ anxiety and trust in the treating physician.
Methods
This parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 2 emergency departments of an academic medical center and an emergency practice in Berlin, Germany. Low-acuity patients seeking care at these sites were randomly assigned to either self-assess their health complaints using a widely available commercial SCA (Ada Health) before their first encounter with the treating physician or receive usual care. The primary endpoint was patients’ satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction, measured by the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). The secondary outcomes were patients’ satisfaction with care, their anxiety levels, and physicians’ satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction. We used linear mixed models to assess the statistical significance of primary and secondary outcomes. Exploratory descriptive analyses examined patients’ and physicians’ perceptions of the SCA’s utility and the frequency of patients questioning their physician’s authority.
Results
Between April 11, 2022, and January 25, 2023, we approached 665 patients. A total of 363 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome (intervention: n=173, control: n=190). PSQ scores in the intervention group were similar to those in the control group (mean 78.5, SD 20.0 vs mean 80.8, SD 19.6; estimated difference –2.4, 95% CI –6.3 to 1.1, P=.24). Secondary outcomes, including patients’ and physicians’ satisfaction with care and patient anxiety, showed no significant group differences (all P>.05). Patients in the intervention group were more likely to report that the SCA had a beneficial (66/164, 40.2%) rather than a detrimental (3/164, 1.8%) impact on the patient-physician interaction, with most reporting no effect (95/164, 57.9%). Similar patterns were observed regarding the SCA’s perceived effect on care. In both groups, physicians rarely reported that their authority had been questioned by a patient (intervention: 2/188, 1.1%; control: 4/184, 2.2%). While physicians more often found the SCA helpful rather than unhelpful, the majority indicated it was neither helpful nor unhelpful for the encounter.
Conclusions
We found no evidence that the SCA improved satisfaction with the patient-physician interaction or care in an acute care setting. By contrast, both patients and their treating physicians predominantly described the SCA’s impact as beneficial. Our study did not identify negative effects of SCA use commonly reported in the literature, such as increased anxiety or diminished trust in health care professionals.

abstract = {Background
Glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, has garnered attention as a substrate for sustainable bioprocessing. This study investigates the metabolic adaptability of a newly isolated strain, Klebsiella variicola JYP01, focusing on glycerol utilization under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the potential of this strain as a proficient producer of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) in sustainable bioprocessing. The research explores the potential of K. variicola JYP01 as the efficient PDO producers with the emphasis on the integration of zero-valent iron (ZVI) to enhance energy production and PDO yield.
Methods
Isolation and characterization of the JYP01 strain, assessing its growth and PDO production under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and incorporating ZVI (as an electron donor) to identify the metabolic fluxes. Several analyses, including 16S rRNA analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and bio-electrochemical system reactors, were employed to elucidate metabolic strategies and the bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to PDO of JYP01 particularly with ZVI.
Significant findings
The integration of ZVI into the bioconversion process significantly enhanced PDO production, leading to 171 % increase from 44.0 mM to 75.2 mM. This demonstrates the distinct ability of the K. variicola JYP01 strain to utilize ZVI as an extra reducing energy in an anaerobic environment. The findings underscore this strain's metabolic capacity, its suitability for glycerol conversion on a large scale, and the novel strategy of using ZVI to elevate PDO production, advancing sustainable bioprocessing techniques.}

This study investigates the attitudes of English major students toward peer feedback in academic writing classes, using Sociocultural Theory as the analytical framework. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, the study first surveyed 142 students to quantify general trends in attitudes, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 participants to explore the sociocultural dimensions underpinning those attitudes. Findings indicate that while students generally perceive peer feedback as beneficial for their academic development, their engagement is notably shaped by sociocultural factors including face-saving norms, perceived proficiency hierarchies, and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Significantly, students strongly preferred anonymity in peer feedback to mitigate emotional discomfort and enhance objectivity. The study concludes that incorporating anonymous feedback mechanisms in peer review activities substantially addresses sociocultural constraints and improves student engagement, thus representing a key strategy for effective writing instruction in EFL contexts. These insights underscore the importance of culturally responsive pedagogical practices and provide clear implications for instructional design in writing pedagogy.}

At the primary analysis of the EV-302 trial, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (EV+P) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC).
Patients and methods
We present an updated analysis of efficacy and safety in the overall population, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, providing an additional year of follow-up since the primary analysis.
Results
The median PFS by blinded independent central review was 12.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-16.6 months] for the EV+P arm and 6.3 months (95% CI 6.2-6.5 months) for the chemotherapy arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.57]. The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 26.1-39.3 months) for the EV+P arm and 15.9 months (95% CI 13.6-18.3 months) for the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.61). Safety data with an additional year of follow-up were consistent with those of the primary analysis.
Conclusion
The continued survival benefit with EV+P compared with chemotherapy in this updated analysis reinforces EV+P as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with la/mUC.}

However, within its dedicated communities, there is recognition of a persistent gap in transitioning these innovations from laboratory-scale success to widespread industrial adoption. Scaling up PI technologies is far more complex than simply replicating laboratory conditions on a larger scale. Challenges such as the integration with existing units and processes, proving economic viability, and navigating regulatory requirements often impede the practical implementation of PI innovations. This paper aims to identify the key enablers for scaling up PI technologies by presenting a roadmap to bridge the gap between concept and commercialization. While robust engineering design frameworks and advanced modeling tools are crucial, interdisciplinary collaborations and lab-to-market partnerships (or integrated scaling collaborations) are equally critical to drive the successful adoption of PI at the industrial scale.}

abstract = {Purpose
To measure the accuracy and cost of a proof-of-concept prompted large language model (LLM) to route procedure requests to the appropriate phone number or pager at a single large academic hospital.
Materials and Methods
At a large academic hospital, existing teams, pager/phone numbers, and schedules were used to create text-based rules for procedure requests. A prompted LLM was created to route procedure requests at specific days and times to the appropriate teams. The prompted LLM was tested on 250 “in-scope” requests (explicitly defined by provided rules) and 25 “out-of-scope” requests using generative pretrained transformer (GPT)–3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models from OpenAI and 4 open-weight models.
Results
The prompted LLM correctly routed 96.4% of in-scope and 76.0% of out-of-scope requests using GPT-4, which outperformed all other models (P < .001). All models demonstrated worse performance for requests during evening and weekend hours (P < .001). OpenAI application programming interface costs were approximately $0.03 per request for GPT-4 and $0.0006 per request for GPT-3.5-turbo.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the accuracy of low-cost prompted LLMs to appropriately route procedure requests in a large academic hospital system. A similar approach may be used to help clinicians navigate a radiology phone tree or as a tool to help reading room coordinators route requests effectively.}

To overcome these limitations and improve model adaptability, we propose a flexible model that leverages dynamic feature aggregation and mask-aware guidance. Our approach introduces an integrated architecture that synergizes Transformers and CNNs, endowed with dynamic learning mechanisms through image and feature-level predictive filtering. This innovative architecture is further enhanced by a mask-guided, dual-way dynamic convolution designed to address discordant decoding issues. The effectiveness of these novel components is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on various benchmark datasets, consistently achieving superior performance in reconstructing coherent and plausible structures, particularly in cases of severe corruption.}

abstract = {As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of >4 orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of ≃50. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.}

abstract = {Surgical simulation is increasingly embedded in training programs. Diverse simulation modalities offer opportunities to support learning in wide-ranging competencies. Examples of approaches to classifying research have been applied to surgical simulation educational research. The article outlines these classifications and offers simulation examples. The surgical simulation community have published research priorities with most articles reflecting strong positivist notions of research. We believe this is a limited view and argue for research that seeks to deepen understanding of how simulation supports learning and can prepare trainees for the complexity of surgical practice. We acknowledge the role of professional communities in advancing simulation research and look to a future of interdisciplinary research. We propose emphasis on synthesizing the current body of knowledge, consulting with real patients for educational focus, fostering interprofessional simulation, clarifying terms used in simulation practice and ensuring high-quality simulation practice aligned with published frameworks.}

In this study, to explore the structural mechanics mechanism, virtual models are performed based on the physical data of the soil and structure, and are compared to the on-site photos of the same scenarios. The basic mechanics is inspected by three Generative AI models in 73 tests to explore the mechanisms by text outputs. The physical-based simplified mechanics models are calculated on the first two supports scenarios to offer some guides and knowledge to the following data mining work. The structural physical mechanics is also numerical simulated to offer some further physical guides. The structure monitoring data of the support axial force and the diaphragm wall deformation in the deep excavation is explored with the time and excavating depths varying, and the relationship of the dual heterogeneous mechanics performance are qualitative discussed by a three-dimension demonstration method. Furthermore, a novel index, the ratio of the force to the deformation, is proposed on the data-driven sight. The relationship is calculated quantitatively on the proposed index in different construction stages, and the probability distribution is inspected. In summary, three physical-based models are performed and investigated to offer physical guides for data-driven dual heterogeneous mechanics mechanism on an underground excavation case in Metro construction, and the qualitative and quantitative exploring are performed based on the three-dimension data demonstrations and on a proposed index. The mechanism exploring methods can be synthetical integrated for the future engineering expert systems in engineering, and for the coming intelligence construction.}

abstract = {Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking.}

Patient may present with abdominal pain, ascites along with hepatomegaly, jaundice, bleeding in the oesophagus, oedema in the legs, hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure. Treatment for Budd-Chiari syndrome in modern science are dissolving blood clots, improve liver function and treat complication. A 51-year-old female patient presented with complaints of pain in right side of abdomen, loss of appetite, abdominal heaviness, abdominal distension, nausea and swelling at bilateral lower leg for one month. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cirrhosis of the liver, thrombosis of the right, middle, and left hepatic veins, along with features of BCS with gross ascites. She is known case of Budd-Chiari syndrome along with gross ascites. The patient was treated with Deepana (which simulates the digestion) and Pachana (enhancing digestion) Koshthashodhana (mild purgation) followed by Vardhamana pippalirasayana(administration of Pippali in a increasing dose and then tapering the dose) and Shamana chikitsa (pacifying treatment)). Pathya-apathya (wholesome diet and regimen) were advised in line with the management of Jalodara for three months. After three-months treatment there was changes in liver profile (SGPT reduced from 250 to 47, SGOT from 328 to 68, alkaline phosphate 272 to 134mg/dl). The assessment of quality of life using the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) indicated improvement in quality of life. This suggests that Ayurvedic treatment can give symptomatic relief and help to prevent it further complication and also improve the overall quality of life.}

abstract = {Background
Over 70% of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) present with a non-shockable initial rhythm, asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), which is associated with lower survival than a shockable initial rhythm. Advanced airway management and oxygen delivery are important OHCA interventions, but their impact based on different presenting rhythm groups are incompletely defined. Our objective was to determine if advanced airway strategy is associated with outcomes in shockable, PEA and asystolic OHCA.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART), which assigned adults with OHCA to a strategy of either endotracheal intubation (ETI) or laryngeal tube (LT) for initial advanced airway management. We stratified patients by initial cardiac rhythm: shockable (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT), AED shock), PEA or asystole. We excluded AED non-shockable and unknown rhythms. The primary outcome was 72-h survival. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at emergency department arrival, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with good neurological function (modified Rankin score ≤3). We used general estimating equations to determine the associations between airway strategy initial arrest rhythm and outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, witnessed status, and bystander CPR.
Results
There were 3004 patients in the parent trial of which 2847 were included in this analysis. Of these 575 (20.2 %) were shockable, 671 (23.6 %) were PEA, and 1601 (56.2 %) were asystole. Compared with ETI, LT airway use was not associated with improved 72-h survival in shockable rhythms (adjusted [AOR] 1.30 (0.91, 1.67)), PEA (AOR 0.97 (0.65, 1.45)), or asystole (AOR 1.13 (0.79, 1.64)). Similarly, we noted no significant interaction between airway strategy and initial rhythm for the secondary outcomes of ROSC, survival to discharge, and survival to discharge with good neurological function.
Conclusion
Prehospital advanced airway management strategy (ETI vs. LT) was not significantly associated with outcomes regardless of initial cardiac rhythm.}

However, recent research highlights significant gaps between students' pre-university quantitative preparation and the level required for successful university-level competency development, which is critical to ensuring the comprehensive acquisition of these skills. This study presents a critical systematic literature review, conducted according to the PRISMA methodology, encompassing 46 peer-reviewed articles that address four research questions that are gaining increasing relevance in the current academic discourse. The findings reveal a significant competency gap among incoming students, particularly those following pre-university pathways recommended by educational institutions. Furthermore, quantitative competencies emerge as a strong predictor of academic performance, not only in quantitative courses but also across the broader curriculum, with cognitive and behavioural-affective variables—such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, and motivation—playing a mediating role. The development of these competencies is enhanced when students engage with well-structured pedagogical environments, including flipped learning and problem-based learning, and when technology is integrated in alignment with sound pedagogical frameworks. The analysis yields avenues for future research, teaching practice and curriculum design, underscoring the need to better align competency transfer between pre-university and higher education stages.}

For a variety of time-intensive steps, numerous types of applications are now available with variable reported measures and degrees of success. The tools we highlight aim to accelerate imaging acquisition, reduce cognitive and manual burden on radiologists and others involved in the care pathway, improve diagnostic accuracy, and shorten the time to clinical action based on imaging results. Most existing studies have focused on intermediate outcomes, such as task duration or time to the next step in care. In this article, we present an examination of AI applications across the medical imaging exam workflow, review examples of real-world evidence on these tools, and summarize the relevant performance metrics by application type. Beyond the more immediately acquired measures, to demonstrate benefit to patient health and economic outcomes, a more integrated assessment is necessary, and in an iterative fashion. To evolve beyond early workflow gains, interoperable tools must be tied to measurable downstream impacts, such as reduced disease severity, lower mortality, and shorter hospital stays, while we acknowledge that current empirical evaluations are limited.}

abstract = {Involving children in creation of school meals is important to engage them on healthy and sustainable eating habits, and the whole food utilization is a way to avoid food waste and increase the consumption of nutrients. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown to be an interesting source of new ideas but has not been used for designing children’s meals. The aims of the work were to evaluate the potential of school meals either co-designed by children or generated with AI, and to explore parents’ perception towards the utilization of whole food in their children’s meal. Children, with the potential support of their parents, proposed recipes with whole fruit/vegetable utilization, and a selection among the suggestions was conducted by nutritionists and the school cooks. The selected meal was compared to a similar recipe from ChatGPT generated from a simple prompt with regard to their acceptance and emotions evoked. The two dishes were variations of carrot pie recipes including vegetable peel and were both prepared by experienced school cooks. A third recipe proposed by the school’s cooks was used as comparison. Parents’ perceptions towards whole food utilization to their children were elicited by sentence completion methodology. Results showed that children liked both their and the cooks’ recipes but rejected ChatGPT’s recipe. Both cooks’ and children’s carrot pies evoked positive emoji pairs, meanwhile ChatGPT’s carrot pie was associated to emojis of negative connotation. Texture and unfamiliar taste were cited to justify the rejection. For parents, the utilization of whole fruits/vegetable in children’s meals is perceived as a good and nutritious idea, but safety concerns were revealed. This work demonstrates co-design with school children and whole food utilization as actionable strategies towards reducing waste of nutritious resources. Moreover, the study reports an unsuccessful exploratory usage of ChatGPT through a task-focused prompt. This may suggest the importance of specifying the context of the task when prompting an AI, to compensate for contextual information that is implicitly available to humans. Concerns about safety aspects should be addressed to ensure parents’ support for whole vegetable utilization in school meals.}

abstract = {Background
Substance use trends are complex; they often rapidly evolve and necessitate an intersectional approach in research, service, and policy making. Current and emerging digital tools related to substance use are promising but also create a range of challenges and opportunities.
Objective
This paper reports on a backcasting exercise aimed at the development of a roadmap that identifies values, challenges, facilitators, and milestones to achieve optimal use of digital tools in the substance use field by 2030.
Methods
A backcasting exercise method was adopted, wherein the core elements are identifying key values, challenges, facilitators, milestones, cornerstones and a current, desired, and future scenario. A structured approach was used by means of (1) an Open Science Framework page as a web-based collaborative working space and (2) key stakeholders’ collaborative engagement during the 2022 Lisbon Addiction Conference.
Results
The identified key values were digital rights, evidence-based tools, user-friendliness, accessibility and availability, and person-centeredness. The key challenges identified were ethical funding, regulations, commercialization, best practice models, digital literacy, and access or reach. The key facilitators identified were scientific research, interoperable infrastructure and a culture of innovation, expertise, ethical funding, user-friendly designs, and digital rights and regulations. A range of milestones were identified. The overarching identified cornerstones consisted of creating ethical frameworks, increasing access to digital tools, and continuous trend analysis.
Conclusions
The use of digital tools in the field of substance use is linked to a range of risks and opportunities that need to be managed. The current trajectories of the use of such tools are heavily influenced by large multinational for-profit companies with relatively little involvement of key stakeholders such as people who use drugs, service providers, and researchers. The current funding models are problematic and lack the necessary flexibility associated with best practice business approaches such as lean and agile principles to design and execute customer discovery methods. Accessibility and availability, digital rights, user-friendly design, and person-focused approaches should be at the forefront in the further development of digital tools. Global legislative and technical infrastructures by means of a global action plan and strategy are necessary and should include ethical frameworks, accessibility of digital tools for substance use, and continuous trend analysis as cornerstones.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) personas for training library staff in an online chat reference environment, enhancing trainees’ abilities to respond effectively to real-life patron requests.
Design/methodology/approach
The project used ChatGPT-4 to construct custom generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) that acted as library patrons and presented the types of questions and reference requests that library staff would likely receive. These AI personas were improved iteratively and collaboratively. Novice chat reference users were surveyed on their experiences with the final AI personas.
Findings
The use of AI personas for training library staff showed promising results. AI personas could simulate interactions with actual patrons, and trainees’ confidence levels increased due to their use. However, limitations still exist, as AI personas were prone to providing overly detailed answers or required prompting to stay on task.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to apply AI personas in the context of improving training for online chat reference. The experience contrasts with other efforts to use generative AI to provide answers directly to patrons without human intervention or involvement.}

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis, characterized by non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, is a multisystem disease with an unpredictable disease spectrum. An estimated 5% of sarcoidosis patients have clinically evident cardiac involvement while 25% may have asymptomatic silent disease leading to challenging diagnosis.
Objectives:
We aim to study the clinical characteristics in a cohort of cardiac sarcoidosis patients to identify patterns of cardiac involvement and clinical correlations.
Methods:
We conducted a single center retrospective study of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis at Mayo Clinic Florida. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB). Inclusion criteria was patients older than 18 years of age, with diagnosis of sarcoid myocarditis/cardiac sarcoidosis/sarcoid heart muscle disease specified ICD-10 code D86.85 with established visits using specified CPT codes between 02/25/2018 till 08/24/2023. A list of 99 patients was generated and 76 patients met above criteria. Subsequently data from each patient was collected that included baseline demographics and disease characteristics.
Results:
Table 1 provides patient demographics. 44 (57.9%) patients were male and 32 (42.1 %) were female with 59 (77.6%) Caucasian and 14 (18.4%) African American. There were 7 deaths (9.2% mortality) with 1 from cardiogenic shock, 1 cardiopulmonary arrest and 1 attributed to side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. 13 (17.1%) patients had a positive exposure history to chemicals and toxins. Only 6 (17.6%) patients had an abnormal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level. Non-necrotizing granulomas noted on pathology in 19 (25.0%) patients and 54 (71.1%) had negative biopsy. Tissue sampled included lung 15 (19.7%), lymph node 19 (25.0%) and cardiac 10 (13.2%). 49 (64.5%) patients had cardiomyopathy with dilated being the most common and heart failure reduced ejection fraction (EF) the predominant type (N=28[41.8%]). 27 (35.5%) patients had abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular (AV) blocks the most frequent rhythm abnormalities. Cardiac MRI was performed in 60 cases and 55 (91.7%) had late gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (PET) was performed in 47 cases and was positive in 42 (89.4%) cases. 69 (90.8%) patients achieved remission while relapsing disease was an unfortunate occurrence in 36 (47.4%) cases [Figure 1].
Conclusion:
Development of a standardized diagnostic algorithm and classification criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis is imperative. Our cohort recorded a high mortality and relapse rate and surveillance for cardiac involvement must be undertaken in all patients with sarcoidosis. Certain occupational exposures were identified and prompts raising awareness for environmental safety. Figure 1Relapse probability over time (months)

abstract = {Generative AI technologies are rapidly advancing and are increasingly deployed by firms for marketing purposes. However, research on generative AI in the marketing domain remains limited, particularly regarding the balance of human-AI collaboration in generative AI video advertisements. This study explores and distinguishes between two types of generative AI video ads based on the balance of human-AI collaboration: (1) those featuring human-AI collaborative characters and (2) those comprising solely AI-generated characters. Using the elaboration likelihood model as a lens, this study proposes a conceptual framework with two parallel mediators: one at the cognitive level (perceived creativity) and the other at the emotional level (AI anxiety). A multi-method study was conducted, employing diverse data sources and analytical techniques. In Study 1, we analyze a real-world dataset of generative AI video advertisements on YouTube to identify the distinct types and examine audience reactions. In Study 2, an experimental design is used to causally evaluate the effects of these advertisements on the audience. The results indicate that generative AI advertisements featuring real human-AI character collaborations generate more favorable audience attitudes, as they are perceived to be more creative and evoke lower levels of AI-induced anxiety compared to advertisements composed entirely of AI-generated characters. The study underscores the critical role of humans as gatekeepers of humanity.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to assess whether information from AI chatbots on benefits and harms of breast and prostate cancer screening were concordant with evidence-based cancer screening recommendations.
Methods
Seven unique prompts (four breast cancer; three prostate cancer) were presented to ChatGPT in March 2024. A total of 60 criteria (30 breast; 30 prostate) were used to assess the concordance of information. Concordance was scored between 0 and 2 against the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations independently by international cancer screening experts.
Results
43 of 60 (71.7 %) criteria were completely concordant, 3 (5 %) were moderately concordant and 14 (23.3 %) were not concordant or not present, with most of the non-concordant criteria (9 of 14, 64.3 %) being from prompts for the oldest age groups. ChatGPT hallucinations (i.e., completely made up, non-sensical or irrelevant information) were found in 9 of 60 criteria (15 %).
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided information mostly concordant with USPSTF breast and prostate cancer screening recommendations, however, important gaps exist. These findings provide insights into the role of AI to communicate cancer screening benefits and harms and hold increased relevance for periods of guideline change.
Practice implications
AI generated information on cancer screening should be taken in conjunction with official screening recommendations and/or information from clinicians.}
