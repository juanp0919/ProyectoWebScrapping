abstract = {Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) leverages the photoacoustic effect to provide high-resolution structural and functional imaging. However, achieving high-speed imaging with high spatial resolution remains challenging. To address this, undersampling and deep learning have emerged as common techniques to enhance imaging speed. Yet, existing methods rarely achieve effective recovery of functional images. In this study, we propose Mask-enhanced U-net (MeU-net) for recovering sparsely sampled PAM structural and functional images. The model utilizes dual-channel input, processing photoacoustic data from 532 nm and 558 nm wavelengths. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive vascular attention mask module that focuses on vascular information recovery and design a vessel-specific loss function to enhance restoration accuracy. We simulate data from mouse brain and ear imaging under various levels of sparsity (4 ×, 8 ×, 12 ×) and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that MeU-net significantly outperforms traditional interpolation methods and other representative models in structural information and oxygen saturation recovery.}

However, existing GenAI chatbots’ output is predominantly presented in plain, text-only formats, which may impose a high cognitive load and trigger negative emotional responses. Despite growing interest in GenAI-assisted writing instruction, limited research has examined how visual enhancements to GenAI chatbot output might improve revision outcomes and learners’ emotional experiences. Grounded in the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media, this study employed a self-developed GenAI-powered writing chatbot to investigate the effects of visualised feedback on EFL learners’ writing performance and emotional responses during revision. A 2 (time: pre-test and post-test) × 2 (feedback mode: visualised vs. non-visualised) quasi-experimental design was employed. Group A (N = 30) received standard text-only feedback, while Group B (N = 30) received visualised feedback incorporating colour variation, tabular formatting, and bolded text. Results from pre-and post-tests and questionnaires indicated that visualised feedback significantly improved coherence and cohesion in learners’ writing, reduced negative emotions, and resulted in lower cognitive load. These findings offer practical implications for language educators, learners, and developers, highlighting the critical role of how AI-generated content is presented in building emotionally supportive and cognitively effective GenAI-assisted learning environments.}

To address this, four workshops were held during the 28th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai. These workshops gathered insights into the experiences of urban children and youth in cities affected by climate change through discussions with youth and other stakeholders present at COP28. Opportunities for creating healthier and more sustainable youth-focused cities were identified using a participatory approach. Youth facilitators led discussions between participants and an expert panel, and participants shared their experiences and perspectives of growing up in cities and their hopes for future youth-focused cities amidst a changing climate. Narrative was collected through an online collaboration tool, which was fed into an artificial intelligence tool to generate images, which served as triggers for further discussion. The thematic analysis of the narratives was conducted by a team of early-career researchers. Three themes were identified: the effects of climate change on urban youth, visions for healthier and more sustainable cities prioritising youth, and principles guiding action. The findings emphasize the importance of involving young people and representing children's needs in research and decision-making.}

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of WMSDs among small-scale construction workers in Namibia's capital city of Windhoek, located in Southern Africa. A cross-sectional survey in Windhoek, Namibia, involved 117 workers from four small-scale construction companies. Self-administered questionnaires and in-depth interviewing procedures were employed in the research to compile data on the occurrence of WMSDs associated with among workers in small-scale construction. Both descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings revealed the symptoms and prevalence of WMSDs in several body parts among the small-scale construction employees surveyed. The research findings further showed that 28 % of respondents lacked safety knowledge for the intention to work safely, whereas 72 % of respondents who planned to work safely indicated greater levels of safety knowledge. Age, brick size and repetitive work were the job risk factors that positively correlated with WMSDs. The results suggest for instance that as the worker ages, so do the chances to contract WMSDs. Overall, the study demonstrated that mechanical, individual, and psychosocial factors all influence the frequency of WMSDs among workers in small-scale construction. However, further research is needed to provide solutions on occupational health of small scale construction workers and on training and awareness of ergonomic risk factors in relation to WMSDs.}

We integrated shoot-level measurements of 13 morphological traits with satellite-derived environmental variables to examine morphological plasticity across three sites along the western Algerian coast (Cap Blanc, Cap Carbon, Sidi Lakhdar). In situ sampling campaigns were conducted during 2012 and 2017, while environmental data— thermal–optical, hydrodynamic, and trophic indices—were extracted via Google Earth Engine (GEE) for the preceding years (2011 and 2016) to capture cumulative pre-seasonal conditions. Principal Component Analysis revealed two dominant axes of morphological variability—leaf elongation/surface area (PC1: 37.8 %) and leaf abundance (PC2: 16.8 %)— Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) (>140 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Hierarchical clustering further identified three phenotypic syndromes, reflecting gradients in foliar development and leaf number. Lower-development syndromes were more common with elevated turbidity and chlorophyll-a, while higher-development syndromes prevailed under clearer, sheltered conditions. Partial Least Squares Regression identified PAR, wind speed, and SST as key predictors, while Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved R2 values up to 0.49 for surface area traits. Redundancy Analysis attributed 55.8 % of constrained variance to SST, PAR, and hydrodynamic gradients. These findings demonstrate that P. oceanica morphological plasticity is primarily driven by light and temperature gradients, modulated by hydrodynamics and trophic conditions. Key traits—leaf elongation, surface area, and shoot density—were predictable from satellite-derived variables, offering a scalable and transferable framework for large-scale, trait-based monitoring and early detection of stress in seagrass ecosystems worldwide.}

abstract = {Objective
To compare the responses of the large language model-based “ChatGPT” to reputable sources when given fertility-related clinical prompts.
Design
The “Feb 13” version of ChatGPT by OpenAI was tested against established sources relating to patient-oriented clinical information: 17 “frequently asked questions (FAQs)” about infertility on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Website, 2 validated fertility knowledge surveys, the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score, as well as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion “optimizing natural fertility.”
Setting
Academic medical center.
Patient(s)
Online AI Chatbot.
Intervention(s)
Frequently asked questions, survey questions and rephrased summary statements were entered as prompts in the chatbot over a 1-week period in February 2023.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
For FAQs from CDC: words/response, sentiment analysis polarity and objectivity, total factual statements, rate of statements that were incorrect, referenced a source, or noted the value of consulting providers.
For fertility knowledge surveys
Percentile according to published population data.
For Committee Opinion
Whether response to conclusions rephrased as questions identified missing facts.
Result(s)
When administered the CDC’s 17 infertility FAQ’s, ChatGPT produced responses of similar length (207.8 ChatGPT vs. 181.0 CDC words/response), factual content (8.65 factual statements/response vs. 10.41), sentiment polarity (mean 0.11 vs. 0.11 on a scale of -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)), and subjectivity (mean 0.42 vs. 0.35 on a scale of 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective)). In total, 9 (6.12%) of 147 ChatGPT factual statements were categorized as incorrect, and only 1 (0.68%) statement cited a reference. ChatGPT would have been at the 87th percentile of Bunting’s 2013 international cohort for the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and at the 95th percentile on the basis of Kudesia’s 2017 cohort for the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score. ChatGPT reproduced the missing facts for all 7 summary statements from “optimizing natural fertility.”
Conclusion(s)
A February 2023 version of “ChatGPT” demonstrates the ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce relevant, meaningful responses to fertility-related clinical queries comparable to established sources. Although performance may improve with medical domain-specific training, limitations such as the inability to reliably cite sources and the unpredictable possibility of fabricated information may limit its clinical use.

This study investigated attitudes towards AI among Hong Kong middle-aged and older adults. In June 2023, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 740 smartphone users aged 45 years or older (Max = 78) in Hong Kong. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found three factors from the General Attitude to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) - Perils, Power, and Promises. Subsequently, with latent profile analysis we revealed three latent profiles: (i) Enthusiasts (18.4%; high on Promises and Power but low on Perils); (ii) Skeptics (12.3%; high on Perils but low on Promises and Power), and (iii) Indecisive (69.3%; moderate on all three factors). The Enthusiasts were more likely to be male, with higher socio-economic status, better self-rated health, and greater mobile device proficiency, optimism, innovativeness, but also less insecurity with technology, compared to the Indecisive, and then to the Skeptics. Our findings suggest that most middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong hold an ambivalent view towards AI, appreciating its power and potentials while also cognizant of the perils it may entail. Our findings are timely considering the recent debates on ethical use of AI evoked by smart phone applications such as ChatGPT and will be valuable for practitioners and scholars for developing inclusive AI-facilitated services and applications.}

The evaluation of the summary, for which a homogeneous rubric is used, is based on two fundamental criteria: content and style. For the data analysis descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used. The results show that the ChatGPT summary obtained the best marks in terms of content and style, with its respective marks being 3 and 2.5 points higher than those of the students. Therefore, we can deduce that the style and content of the ChatGPT summary greatly exceeded those presented by the students. These results are independent of the ages, levels of professional experience, and genders of the teachers who corrected the summary. The integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT must be based on solid methodological proposals that integrate their use from a creative and critical perspective that allows learning with the support of these tools and not using them as substitutes for the development of basic student competencies.}

Accurately measuring the distribution of bioaerosol concentrations in the indoor environment holds significant importance. Current methodologies are constrained by limitations in measurement resolution and speed, and unable to obtain the global 3D concentration fields directly. We propose a Sparse Reconstruction Latent Diffusion Model (SR-LDM) that reconstructs the 3D global concentration field from the asynchronous sparse bioaerosol concentration data measured by LiDAR. The concentration field reconstruction is formulated as a conditional generation task, leveraging the powerful generative capabilities of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) to infer global distributions from sparse observational data. We employ a contrastive learning strategy to train a dedicated condition encoder, which extracts information from spatiotemporal sparse data measured at different locations and times to guide the generation of the global concentration field. We use a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver to construct a dataset of aerosol concentration fields in an empty channel. The results indicate that our SR-LDM model effectively reconstructs the global concentration field formed by a single release source, using historical sparse measurement data that accounts for 1 %–3.2 % of the total number of units. In most cases, high-quality results are obtained after 6–16 iterations, and the similarity with CFD data reaches 80 %.}

During this time, using the HEartS Professional multi-strategy survey, we collected data in three phases in the United Kingdom (UK): initially during the first national lockdown (Phase 1, April–June 2020; Spiro, Perkins et al., 2021), and then annually for two years; Phase 2 (April–May 2021; Spiro, Shaughnessy et al., 2023), and Phase 3 (May–July 2022). In this article, we focus on Phase 3. Our first goal is to explore which factors are important in the context of mental and social wellbeing (measured using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the 15-item Social Connectedness Scale-Revised, and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale). Our second goal is to consider how work and wellbeing are associated with job satisfaction. Physical activity, social activity, financial stability, and health are significantly associated with mental and social wellbeing for the 564 professional artists in the UK who responded to our survey, and there are links between mental wellbeing and job satisfaction. As the creative industries emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and tackle ongoing challenges, a longer-term approach in this area is needed: one that allows a more holistic understanding of the contributors to arts professionals' work and wellbeing. Informed by the data collected in Phases 1 to 3, where we see consistent trends, we propose a conceptual model – the HEartS Professional Model – for understanding the drivers that are associated with arts professionals' wellbeing and job satisfaction. Within this model, the variables can be seen as part of wider domains: broad thematic groups including community (including perceived social connection and living situation), healthy living (including self-rated health and physical activity), finance (including financial hardship and household income), and demographics (including gender and age). The HEartS Professional Model has the potential to inform development of support, policy, and infrastructure in the creative industries that are fit for purpose and respond to creative professionals’ needs. Furthermore, it has the potential to be the basis for the long-term tracking and understanding of work, wellbeing, and job-satisfaction in the arts.}

Nonetheless, the naturally high intrinsic chloride ion content within SWSSC renders conventional techniques for determining its chloride ion diffusion coefficient (D) particularly susceptible to inaccuracies. This study proposes a novel framework that integrates a conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) with stacking ensemble learning models to address data limitations when predicting the D of SWSSC. We compiled a dataset comprising 80 experimental and 320 synthetic instances, complemented by 11 input features. The CTGAN algorithm was subsequently employed to generate the synthetic data. Following this, five machine learning (ML) methods and four stacking ensemble learning models were utilized to predict the D of SWSSC. Hyperparameters for these ML models were optimized using ten-fold cross-validation and the beluga whale optimization (BWO) algorithm. Results show that the synthetic dataset offers credibility enabling the development of ML models with higher prediction accuracy in estimating the D of SWSSC. Within the collection of ML architectures developed through synthetic data training, Ensemble ML-1 exhibited optimal forecasting precision, registering validation R² and RMSE statistics of 0.8800 and 1.3347 × 10⁻¹ ² m²/s correspondingly for D of SWSSC prediction. SHAP feature importance analysis identified water, coarse aggregate, fly ash, and W/B as the highest influential parameters affecting the D of SWSSC. Integrating stacking ensemble learning, data augmentation, and model interpretation, the proposed method can be applied to predict other durability performance indicators in low-carbon concrete.}

The findings highlight different experiences and perceptions of enteral nutrition depending on whether the patient has a nasogastric/nasojejunal tube (NGT/NJT) or a gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube (GT/JT). If patients trust enteral nutrition and acknowledge its positive outcomes, their experience is more positive with gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube. This approach offers valuable insights into the impact of the enteral nutrition on the patients’ daily life and allows all healthcare stakeholders to better consider the reality of their experiences.}

abstract = {Damage imaging plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems for fast and efficient damage assessment. Delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming is a widely used algorithm in non-destructive testing for damage imaging, but its effectiveness is often compromised by the use of sparse ultrasonic transducer arrays and the difficulty in detecting progressive delamination larger than the wavelength using guided wave-based methods under fatigue loading. Although X-ray imaging offers detailed assessments of progressive delamination, its application is still limited due to the need to interrupt fatigue loading cycles and its high operational cost. To this end, we propose a novel Damage Imaging framework that uses the fine-tuned Conditional Diffusion Model for SHM systems (DI-CDM). Leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models, the framework was fine-tuned by combining DAS beamforming images derived from ultrasonic sparse array data with X-ray images captured during fatigue loading cycles of the composite structures. The proposed approach can generate damage images that reveal the progression of delamination size in the fatigue loading process. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental data from NASA datasets for composite structures, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness by applying diffusion models in SHM applications to enable fast, high-resolution damage imaging.}

This study proposes a lightweight assessment model for transformer windings, integrating an image fusion module and a recognition module to address the accuracy limitations of single-image analysis and the high computational demands of multi-scale analysis. First, a Parallel Efficient Mixed Attention Mechanism (PEMAM) is proposed, designed to enhance adaptability to transformer vibration signals while maintaining a low parameter count. This mechanism improves the feature extraction capability of the Image Fusion Framework based on a Convolutional Neural Network, significantly boosting the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing resistance to distortion in fused images. Subsequently, multi-scale Markov field images, derived from the time and frequency domain features of vibration signals, are fused and fed into the PEMAM-enhanced recognition module for condition assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 99.63 % accuracy in identifying transformer winding conditions while maintaining low model complexity and computational cost.}

Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%.

In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the system’s predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge users’ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.}

Several studies have depicted an essential role for dampened mitophagy and mitochondrial injury in Dox cardiotoxicity. However, preventative measure to alleviate Dox-evoked cardiotoxicity via targeting mitophagy and mitochondrial integrity remains elusive. Urolithin A (UA) is a newly identified mitophagy inducer with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties although its effect on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. This study was designed to explore the effect of UA on Dox cardiotoxicity and mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that UA alleviated Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction exhibited by echocardiographic parameters and histological analyses, and partially relieved Dox-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and mitochondrial dysfunction including ΔΨm dissipation and ROS production in vitro. The ability of UA to facilitate restoration of mitophagy in mice and H9C2s underscored its advantageous effects, manifested as upregulation of mitophagy-related proteins, including p62, LC3, PINK1 and Parkin, as well as the co-location between LC3 and mitochondria. Incubation with 3 -MA nearly reversed the UA-evoked rise of mitophagy-related proteins, and inhibition of apoptosis. Given that knockdown of Ambra1 almost abolished UA-induced protective effect, the enhanced expression of Ambra1 owing to UA increased PINK1 levels by inhibiting its degradation via LONP1. Collectively, our results suggest that the cardioprotective properties of UA depend on the stimulation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy through promoting Ambra1 expression to inhibit PINK1 degradation by LONP1. This highlights UA's potential as a valuable treatment option and its importance in cardioprotective strategies against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.}

abstract = {Background
In the United States, 1 in 5 adults currently serves as a family caregiver for an individual with a serious illness or disability. Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training. Thus, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care. Leveraging technology as an educational tool or an adjunct to care is a promising approach that has the potential to enhance the learning and caregiving capabilities of family caregivers. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers. An LLM can be categorized as a foundation model (FM), which is a large-scale model trained on a broad data set that can be adapted to a range of different domain tasks. Despite their potential, FMs have the critical weakness of “hallucination,” where the models generate information that can be misleading or inaccurate. Information reliability is essential when language models are deployed as front-line help tools for caregivers.
Objective
This study aimed to (1) develop a reliable caregiving language model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, (2) develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and (3) evaluate the model’s performance compared with a large FM.
Methods
We developed a CaLM using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. The key components of the CaLM are the caregiving knowledge base, a fine-tuned FM, and a retriever module. We used 2 small FMs as candidates for the foundation of the CaLM (LLaMA [large language model Meta AI] 2 and Falcon with 7 billion parameters) and adopted a large FM (GPT-3.5 with an estimated 175 billion parameters) as a benchmark. We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the internet. We focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. We evaluated the models’ performances using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability for providing accurate references with their answers.
Results
The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the large FM performed better than the small FMs across all metrics. Interestingly, the small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA 2 with a small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers.
Conclusions
The study shows that a reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain.}

Tryptophan metabolism is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, its genetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic variants that encode tryptophan metabolism on susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) and elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in EC progression.
Methods
Age- and sex-matched cohorts of 167 patients with EC and 236 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites were determined by self-assembled high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High-throughput sequencing techniques were utilized to detect candidate coding genetic variants, and dominant genetic models were used to elucidate the genotypic associations.
Results
Tryptophan metabolism was significantly imbalanced in patients with EC, with elevated indolepropionic acid (IPA) levels reducing the risk of EC susceptibility. ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) mutation was associated with higher IPA levels in vivo (P = 0.0004, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.0092) and significantly reduced the risk of EC susceptibility (odds ratio [OR]: 0.576, Padj = 0.0161). Mediation effect analysis indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphism may inhibit carcinogenesis by reducing IPA metabolism and excretion with a mediation effect of 45.54%.
Conclusions
This study identifies the potential mechanism of ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) in esophageal carcinogenesis and its role in driving increased IPA levels, thereby suppressing the risk of development.}

A diagnostic criterion for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is difficulty concentrating and increased distractibility. One form of distraction that occurs in everyday life is mind-wandering. The current study aims to test how individuals with MDD and healthy controls differ in their mind-wandering in everyday life.
Methods
Adults diagnosed with MDD (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 53) completed a week of experience sampling, with prompts administered up to eight times per day. At each prompt, participants reported the occurrence and characteristics of their mind-wandering. They also reported levels of momentary negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and rumination.
Results
MDD participants reported mind-wandering almost twice as often as healthy control participants. Compared to healthy participants, MDD participants rated their mind-wandering as more negative, but did not differ in terms of temporal orientation. Higher NA and lower PA predicted mind-wandering in the MDD group but not healthy controls, even after controlling for rumination. Time-lagged analyses revealed that current mind-wandering predicted future levels of PA in MDD participants but not in healthy controls; in contrast, current NA and PA did not predict future mind-wandering.
Limitations
Limitations include our examination of specific forms of mind-wandering (i.e., we did not sample the full spectrum of this construct).
Conclusions
Individuals with MDD frequently report engaging in mind-wandering in everyday life, and this appears to be coupled with affect. Mind-wandering may have maladaptive effects in MDD and could serve as a target for intervention.}

abstract = {Introduction
Sertraline is the frontline pharmacotherapy for the treatment of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. However, there is little evidence regarding the effects of sertraline on maternal behaviour or the maternal brain. Furthermore, the efficacy of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment in pregnancy, such as exercise, are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of sertraline and exercise during pregnancy on maternal postpartum depressive-like, anxiety-like and associated behaviours, as well as litter characteristics, in a rat model of depression. We also investigated the effects of these treatments on the maternal brain, focusing initially on DNA methylation and glutamatergic markers, which have been implicated in depression.
Method
Twenty-four female Wistar-Kyoto (WKY; strain that models depression and anxiety) rats were divided into three groups: 1. WKY-Sertraline; 2. WKY-Exercise, 3. WKY-Vehicle; Six female Wistar (WIS) rats were included as controls. Rats were treated with sertraline (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (33 % propylene glycol) twice/day, from gestational day (GD) 1 to postpartum day 14. The WKY-Exercise group were provided access to a running wheel during pregnancy for 3 h/day from GD1–18. Dam and litter characteristics, as well as pup ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), were measured. Dams underwent behavioural testing at 5-weeks postpartum to assess depressive-, anxiety- and cognitive-like behaviours. Gene expression of DNA methylation markers (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a) and glutamate receptors (Grin1, Grin2a, Grin2b) were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), using RT-qPCR.
Result
The WKY-Sertraline group gained 39 % less weight in their first pregnancy week compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) and produced smaller litters compared to WIS controls (−43 %; p = 0.003) and WKY-Exercise (−38 %; p = 0.012); WKY-Sertraline pups had slightly smaller brain weights compared to WKY-Vehicle (p = 0.031). WKY-Vehicle pups showed reduced number of USV calls, call amplitude and call duration compared to WIS control (p < 0.001). The WKY-Exercise pups produced increased number of USVs, with increased call amplitude of USVs, at postnatal day (PN)7 compared to WKY-Vehicle (p < 0.01). Maternal sertraline treatment did not significantly affect dam postpartum behavioural measures, or maternal cortical gene expression. The WKY-Exercise group however showed reduced anxiety-like behaviours, spending more time in the open arms (620 %; p = 0.027) and less time in the closed arms (−22 %; p = 0.047) of the elevated plus maze (EPM) compared to WKY-Vehicle, and more time in the centre of the open field test (OFT) compared to WKY-Vehicle (132 %; p = 0.057). Furthermore, WKY-Exercise dams showed a 64 % increase in Dnmt3a mRNA levels in the PFC compared to WKY-Vehicle (p = 0.019), effectively reversing the 44 % reduction observed in WKY-Veh relative to WIS controls (p = 0.009).
Conclusion
Voluntary exercise during pregnancy in the WKY rat model, reduced postpartum anxiety-like behaviour. This was accompanied by elevated DNMT3a gene expression in the PFC, suggesting this region may be sensitive to DNA methylation changes following maternal exercise. In contrast, maternal sertraline did not impact these behaviours or genes. Maintaining sertraline treatment beyond postpartum day 14, or trialling different doses, may have resulted in broader effects on postpartum behaviour, which should be explored further. Maternal sertraline did appear to have some adverse effects on the in-utero environment, evidenced by smaller litters, with slightly smaller pup brain weights, which should be investigated further. Our findings suggest a long-term beneficial effect of exercise during pregnancy and support future studies examining the effects of exercise in antenatal depression in the human population.}

The findings reveal that the evaluation ability of information-based teaching has a positive impact on the design ability of information-based teaching objectives, the provision ability of information-based teaching resources, the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the guidance ability of information-based teaching, and the path coefficients are 0.86, 0.60, 0.36, and 0.45, respectively. Teachers’ platform resource integration ability has a positive impact on information-based teaching evaluation ability, information-based teaching tool application ability, and information-based teaching activity organization ability, and the path coefficients are 0.45, 0.71, and 0.39, respectively; Teachers’ organization ability of information-based teaching activities has a positive impact on information-based teaching guidance ability, and the path coefficient is 0.39. The ability of teachers to use information-based teaching tools has a positive impact on the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the path coefficient is 0.25. The ability to provide information teaching resources and the ability to apply information teaching tools have a positive impact on each other, and the path coefficients are 0.43 and 0.49, respectively. These seven dimensions have constructed the model of teachers' online teaching ability, and proposed the ways to improve teachers' online teaching ability based on the current situation of teachers' online teaching ability.}

This study evaluates the added value of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) for enhancing separation, mass spectral quality, chromatographic structure and from access to collisional cross section (CCS) values in NTS workflows. Four LCHRMS configurations were compared: RPLCHRMS, HILICHRMS, RPLC × HILICHRMS, and HILIC × RPLCHRMS, each with and without travelling wave (TW)IMS. Data were acquired in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. Phenolic compounds in wheat flag leaf extracts were analyzed as a representative case. The results show that mass spectral purity improved up to 74 times when hyphenating RPLC with IMS for peaks with intensities <1.5 × 104. The compound groups: flavones, flavan-3-ols, benzoic acid derivatives and phenolic acids were separated into distinct retention time regions in RPLC × HILIC, while co-eluting in RPLC and HILIC. Only two of ten isomeric pairs were partially resolved by IMS, with resolutions of 0.50 and 0.63, whereas RPLC achieved resolution values of 29 and 13 for the same pairs. Notably, the only isomers with IMS resolution ≥ 0.5 had m/z > 447. We showed that large TWCCSN2deviations (-9.47 %) were observed when several deprotomers of a molecule were created and separated in IMS. Deprotomers are not accommodated for in the machine learning prediction models, which limits their use for such molecules. The complementary strengths of IMS and LC × LC should be exploited strategically to address specific analytical goals in plant metabolite screening.}

abstract = {Digestive diseases are common in poultry and significantly affect their health and productivity. Image processing techniques have gained attention for detecting early signs of disease by analyzing abnormal poultry manure. However, building a reliable system for identifying and locating abnormal manure in real-world conditions remains challenging and requires large amounts of labeled data for supervised learning. Among deep learning models, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) detector is widely used in precision agriculture due to its speed and accuracy. Herein, a new dataset was created for abnormal poultry manure identification based on updated classification criteria, which included 5688 bounding box annotations across five categories collected from commercial chicken farms. In total, 21 state-of-the-art YOLO models from 8 YOLO versions (YOLOv3–YOLOv9) were fine-tuned and validated to establish comprehensive benchmarks. Detection accuracy in terms of mAP@0.5 ranged from 95.6 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 99.4 % by YOLOv8m, while accuracy in terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95] ranged from 72.9 % by YOLOv4-tiny to 82.2 % by YOLOv9s, with 10 models achieving scores above 80.0 % in mAP@0.5:0.95. High accuracy and efficiency were demonstrated by YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s with inference times under 3 ms. However, traditional data augmentation methods were not fully effective in expanding abnormal manure samples. To address this issue, generative models were explored for data augmentation, where denoising diffusion probabilistic models generated realistic images, showing promising potential. This research provides benchmark data for the classification of abnormal poultry manure, which will become an important resource for promoting future research on poultry disease detection and control based on big data and artificial intelligence, making a fundamental contribution to the field of poultry health monitoring.}

To this end, motivational writing instructional strategies were integrated into the process-genre argumentative writing instructional approach and the impacts on students' writing engagement and achievements were assessed at a university in China. Quantitative data were gathered from 142 undergraduate students employing a pretest-posttest control group design. Additionally, self-report data regarding students' writing engagement and perceptions were collected from experimental groups to examine the contribution of students' perceptions of the motivational process-genre writing instructional approach to their engagement. Moreover, focus-group data were gathered from four highly-engaged and high-achieving students to identify the factors facilitating their engagement. The results showed that the experimental groups wrote significantly better argumentative essays than did the control group, and regression analyses indicated that motivational instructional strategies contributed to students' engagement significantly. Further, the thematic analysis of focus group data suggested that the three major facilitators of students’ engagement were collaborative motivational writing learning strategies, competence-boosting experiences, and active participation in creating learning opportunities. These findings show the paramount significance of incorporating the motivational strategies into the process-genre writing instructional approach. Other pedagogical implications and recommendations for further research are also discussed.}

Specifically, we first applied the Multi-LLMs Validation method, significantly reducing the manual proofreading workload involved in structured data extraction. Furthermore, based on this approach, we successfully established the largest CPM dataset (https://gitee.com/tcmdoc/cpm) with continuous on-line updates. Afterwards, we combined the CPM dataset and the RAG architecture, along with effective integration of generative capacity from LLMs and external data retrieval; all of which contributed to the RAG-CPMF.

The ability to detect fake videos among Hungarian secondary school students (N = 507) was assessed using a 16-item video test. The results of the online survey are partly consistent and partly contradictory to the literature. There is no gender difference in the ability to detect fake videos in the age group studied, and media literacy and media use do not influence the ability to detect fake videos. However, a more conservative worldview and higher parental education are associated with better detection of fake videos. The paper concludes with recommendations.}

To address this issue, we propose a novel method for microbe-drug association prediction based on Graph Attention Networks and Inductive Matrix Completion, named SRGMCMDA. First, we integrate multiple similarities of microbes and drugs using a Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) approach. Next, we employ Random Walk with Restart (RWR) to capture latent and higher-order association information. Subsequently, a Talking-Head Attention Network efficiently focuses on the most critical features in the input data, while a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is introduced to further optimize the extraction of high-order feature information. Finally, we concatenate low-dimensional features with association features and employ a Convolutional Neural Network-enhanced Inductive Matrix Completion (CNNIMC) to process the concatenated features, combining nonlinear and linear characteristics to generate the final microbe-drug score prediction matrix. Performance evaluation demonstrates that SRGMCMDA achieves an AUC of 0.9713 and an AUPR of 0.9618, outperforming classical machine learning methods and several common deep learning approaches. Case studies show that SRGMCMDA can accurately predict candidate drugs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and Escherichia coli, as well as candidate microbes linked to Epigallocatechin Gallate.}

Taking a social perspective, this article examines how the design of mixed-reward LPs helps to reinforce Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) image. Results from two experiments show that mixed-reward LPs can improve a firm's CSR image as well as customer loyalty, and the importance of giving customers options. Specifically, compared to a self-benefiting reward LP, a mixed-reward LP improves CSR image, but only when customers can choose the recipient charity. Allowing customers to split their donation between multiple charities further improves CSR image through the mediating effects of LP usage (i.e., prosocial redemption) and a social benefit for the customer (i.e., warm glow). These findings suggest that LPs can be relevant drivers for doing good and offer an additional, socially-based logic to rethink their role and design.}

Caregivers of children with mental health challenges are at heightened risk for burnout and absenteeism. This strain affects both their well-being and work performance, contributing to widespread workplace issues. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly used to support pediatric mental health, but their impact on caregiver outcomes remains underexplored.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the associations between caregiver burnout, absenteeism (ie, missing work), comorbid symptoms, and child mental health problems, and to assess whether caregiver burnout and absenteeism improved as their child participated in a pediatric DMHI.
Methods
This retrospective study included 6506 caregivers whose children (aged 1‐17 years) received care from Bend Health, Inc, a pediatric DMHI providing digital-based therapy and coaching, digital content, and caregiver support. Caregiver burnout, absenteeism, comorbid symptoms, and child mental health symptoms were measured by monthly assessments. Cumulative link models were used to assess the associations of between child symptoms and caregiver outcomes and to assess changes in caregiver outcomes over the course of the DMHI. Analyses of baseline associations included the full sample (n=6506), while analyses of pre-post changes in caregiver outcomes were conducted in caregivers with elevated burnout (n=2121) and absenteeism (n=1327) who had an assessment after starting care.
Results
At baseline, 45.96% (2990/6506) of caregivers reported elevated burnout and 28.96% (1884/6506) reported elevated absenteeism. More severe burnout was associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of any type (all P<.01). More severe absenteeism was significantly associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of depression (z=3.33; P<.001), anxiety (z=3.96; P<.001), inattention (z=2.48; P=.013), and hyperactivity (z=2.12; P=.03). Burnout decreased for 68.64% (1456/2121) and absenteeism decreased for 87.26% (1158/ 1327). Greater months in care was associated with less severe caregiver burnout (z=−5.48; P<.001) and absenteeism (z=−6.74; P<.001).
Conclusions
DMHIs for children may reduce caregiver burnout and absenteeism. These findings emphasize the value of employers offering pediatric DMHIs as part of employee benefits, potentially enhancing workplace outcomes.}

IED is associated with a host of cognitive and affective symptoms not included in the diagnostic criteria which may be a valuable indicator of heterogeneity in IED—such information can be useful to enhance understanding and treatment of this disorder in mental health settings. A preliminary investigation conducted on cognitive-affective symptom heterogeneity in individuals with a history of IED demonstrated that level of emotional dysregulation primarily differentiated IED subgroups, however the sample size was limited, and almost half of the individuals did not have current IED (only lifetime IED). The present study addressed these limitations by conducting a latent class analysis of cognitive-affective symptoms among a large (n = 504) sample of individuals diagnosed with current IED. The latent IED classes were then externally validated on several adverse outcomes, historical precursors, and demographic variables. Statistical and clinical indicators supported a four-class model, with classes primarily distinguished by patients' severity of emotion dysregulation. The two moderate emotion-dysregulated classes both endorsed callous-unemotional traits and low empathy relative to other classes, a finding which differs from the initial investigation. An external validation of the four classes revealed that they significantly differed on severity outcomes (e.g., aggression, suicide attempts, antisocial behavior, global functioning, comorbidities) and historical precursors (e.g., aversive parental care, childhood maltreatment). These findings provide further insight into the heterogeneity within IED and the associations of such variability with important precursors and clinical outcomes.}

Unknown cause–effect relationships lead to production deviations and costly scrap. Therefore, data-driven approaches are increasingly being used to uncover these complex interactions. Creating comprehensive, transparent data sets based on production data, enables the identification of correlations and relevant parameters, thus facilitating efficiency improvements and the optimization of the lithium-ion production. Currently, tracking and tracing of production data to individual electrode sections is performed with physical markers on uncoated electrode parts or coils. Interactions within the processing of the battery electrodes and mechanical deformation of the current collector foil can lead to illegibility of the physical markings and thus make tracking and tracing impossible. Furthermore, the resolution of the data recording is currently tied to the discrete markings. However, advances in computer vision and computing power offer a non-invasive, marker-free solution using camera images. This paper presents an approach of unique identification of electrode sections using image-matching for marker-free tracking and tracing applications. High-resolution electrode images were acquired in-line, allowing the evaluation of artificial intelligence to demonstrate the applicability of different classical and learning-based image-matching approaches for the identification of electrode sections. The results provided a clear recommendation for image-based tracking and tracing using neuronal networks. Marker-free tracking using electrode images allowed for immediate identification of electrode sections, storage of production data in a virtual electrode model, and inclusion of additional quality information derived from the images.}

This review aims to explore the different types of skin cancer, their clinical features, and their worldwide prevalence based on the literature. Literature from different electronic databases, including Google Scholar, ResearchGate, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Elsevier, and Springer, were collected through a literature search using specific keywords such as “skin cancer”, “skin cancer types”, “melanoma”, “non-melanoma”, “skin cancer continental prevalence” or similar keywords. The search included English publications from 2000 to 2024. Melanoma skin cancer (MSC) ranks 17th in global prevalence, with the highest incidence and deaths occurring in Europe, However, Australia and New Zealand record the highest incidence and mortality rates. Asia has a lower incidence rate of melanoma, but a higher mortality rate. Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) is the most common type of MSC. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have the highest incidence in North America, with the highest number of deaths occurring in Asia, Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidence rates for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most commonly diagnosed skin cancer worldwide and the most prevalent form of NMSCs; however, squamous cell carcinoma is the most aggressive form of NMSCs, causing more deaths. NMSCs are the most prevalent cancers worldwide, causing most skin cancer-related deaths.

The types and subtypes of skin cancer are becoming more common among clinically diagnosed cancers. This review comprehensively describes skin cancer types and their prevalence worldwide. However, the actual prevalence of skin cancer in these countries should be investigated.

abstract = {Background
Gas explosion injuries are a severe form of trauma with high incidence and mortality rates, both in daily life and industrial settings. Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most serious complications of gas explosion injuries and is a leading cause of mortality in such cases. However, the mechanisms underlying gas explosion-induced ALI have not been fully elucidated, and the treatment process consumes a significant amount of medical resources. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on the injury mechanisms of gas explosion injuries, especially the mechanisms of gas explosion-induced ALI, which can effectively improve the treatment rate of this condition. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between a novel form of cell death, ferroptosis, and gas explosion-induced ALI, and explored its specific mechanisms.
Methods
We established ALI rat model by Shock tube biological injury system, and detected lung injury-related indexes as well as ferroptosis related indexes, such as glutathione peroxidase 4（GPX4）, 4-hydroxynonenal（4HNE）, Malondialdehyde（MDA）, Fe2 + . We also investigated the therapeutic effects of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) in ALI induced by gas explosion, as well as its specific mechanisms of action.
Results
A rat ALI model by gas explosion was successfully established. After the gas explosion treatment, we observed that the systemic inflammatory reaction of rats was increased, and lung function, liver function, kidney function and cardiac function were damaged to different degrees. The inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissue was more severe, and the degree of lung injury and pulmonary edema increased. The ferroptosis markers GPX4 was decreased, while the levels of 4HNE, MDA and Fe2 + were increased. Treatment with Fer-1 significantly ameliorated gas explosion ALI damage and down-regulated the expression level of ferroptosis.
Conclusions
Gas explosion-induced ALI in rats is characterized by enhanced inflammatory responses and reduced antioxidant capacity in lung tissues. The specific mechanism of injury involves ferroptosis. Fer-1 has been shown to mitigate the severity of ALI caused by gas explosion by suppressing ferroptosis expression levels in lung tissues via the Nrf2/GPX4 axis.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep health is a multidimensional construct that includes objective and subjective parameters and is influenced by individual sleep-related behaviors and sleep disorders. Symptom network analysis allows modeling of the interactions between variables, enabling both the visualization of relationships between different factors and the identification of the strength of those relationships. Given the known influence of sex and age on sleep health, network analysis can help explore sets of mutually interacting symptoms relative to these demographic variables.
Objective
This study aimed to study the centrality of symptoms and compare age and sex differences regarding sleep health using a symptom network approach in a large French population that feels concerned about their sleep.
Methods
Data were extracted from a questionnaire provided by the Réseau Morphée health network. A network analysis was conducted on 39 clinical variables related to sleep disorders and sleep health. After network estimation, statistical analyses consisted of calculating inferences of centrality, robustness (ie, testifying to a sufficient effect size), predictability, and network comparison. Sleep clinical variable centralities within the networks were analyzed by both sex and age using 4 age groups (18-30, 31-45, 46-55, and >55 years), and local symptom-by-symptom correlations determined.
Results
Data of 35,808 participants were obtained. The mean age was 42.7 (SD 15.7) years, and 24,964 (69.7%) were women. Overall, there were no significant differences in the structure of the symptom networks between sexes or age groups. The most central symptoms across all groups were nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In the youngest group, additional central symptoms were chronic circadian misalignment and chronic sleep deprivation (related to sleep behaviors), particularly among women. In the oldest group, leg sensory discomfort and breath abnormality complaint were among the top 4 central symptoms. Symptoms of sleep disorders thus became more central with age than sleep behaviors. The high predictability of central nodes in one of the networks underlined its importance in influencing other nodes.
Conclusions
The absence of structural difference between networks is an important finding, given the known differences in sleep between sexes and across age groups. These similarities suggest comparable interactions between clinical sleep variables across sexes and age groups and highlight the implication of common sleep and wake neural circuits and circadian rhythms in understanding sleep health. More precisely, nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are central symptoms in all groups. The behavioral component is particularly central in young people and women. Sleep-related respiratory and motor symptoms are prominent in older people. These results underscore the importance of comprehensive sleep promotion and screening strategies tailored to sex and age to impact sleep health.}

The animal sector is one of the major contributors to the development and dissemination of AMR and accounts for more than 50 % of global antibiotics usage. The use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure for resistant bacteria in the exposed microbiome, but many questions about the epidemiology of AMR in farm environments remain unanswered. This is connected to several methodological challenges and limitations, such as inconsistent sampling methods, complexity of farm environment samples and the lack of standardized protocols for sample collection, processing and bioinformatical analysis. In this project, we combined metagenomics and bioinformatics to optimise the methodology for reproducible research on the resistome in complex samples from the indoor farm environment. The work included optimizing sample collection, transportation, and storage, as well as DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, such as metagenome assembly and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) detection. Our studies suggest that the current most optimal and cost-effective pipeline for ARG search should be based on Illumina sequencing of sock sample material at high depth (at least 25 M 250 bp PE for AMR gene families and 43 M for gene variants). We present a computational analysis utilizing MEGAHIT assembly to balance the identification of bacteria carrying ARGs with the potential loss of diversity and abundance of resistance genes. Our findings indicate that searching against multiple ARG databases is essential for detecting the highest diversity of ARGs.}

To address these challenges, we introduce PromptLanguage (Plang), a string-first programming language designed specifically for LLM prompt engineering. Our key innovation lies in utilizing font styles as syntax keywords to seamlessly integrate natural language prompt text with control flow code, enabling precise intervention in the generation process while maintaining the natural language affinity of prompt programs. Notably, Plang pioneers the concept of meta-prompt programming. Extensive experimental results across prompt engineering cases and quantitative analyses demonstrate that Plang-written prompt programs offer superior read/writability, intervention precision and up to 89.55% efficiency improvements.

abstract = {Background
Stress is a significant issue amongst university students, yet limited psychological services are available. Mindfulness is effective for stress reduction and can be delivered digitally to expand access to student populations. However, digital interventions often suffer from low engagement and poor adherence. A virtual human may improve engagement and adherence through its humanlike appearance and behaviours.
Objective
To examine whether a virtual human could reduce stress in university students at least as much as a teletherapist, and more than a chatbot, using a mindfulness intervention.
Methods
Stressed university students (N = 158) were randomly allocated to the virtual human (N = 54), chatbot (N = 54), or teletherapist (N = 50). 36 participants received each condition. Participants completed one lab session and were asked to do online homework sessions at least twice weekly for four weeks. Changes in self-reported stress and mindfulness, physiological stress indices, homework completion, and perceptions of the agent were compared between groups. Thematic analysis was conducted on participants’ responses to open-ended questions about the interventions.
Results
There were significant reductions in stress and increases in mindfulness across all groups. All groups had higher peripheral skin temperature post-intervention, and only the teletherapy group had higher electrodermal activity (reflecting elevated stress) post-intervention compared to baseline. There were no significant changes in heart rate. Homework adherence was significantly higher in the virtual human group, whereas homework satisfaction and engagement were lowest in the chatbot group. Thematic analysis found that people thought the robotic voice of the virtual human could be improved, the chatbot could be improved by adding audio, and that participants experienced feelings of judgement from the teletherapist.
Discussion
Overall, results support use of virtual humans for delivering mindfulness interventions in stressed students. Virtual humans may have the advantage over teletherapy and chatbots of increasing adherence in student populations, but more work is needed to increase perceived empathy and replicate results in other populations.}

Although ∼40 % of precipitation in certain regions is recycled moisture from Africa's tropical rainforest, there needs to be more knowledge about how this moisture supports the continent's agriculture. In this study, we quantify all moisture sources for agrarian precipitation (African agricultural precipitationshed), the estimates of African rainforest's moisture contribution to agricultural precipitation, and the evaporation from agricultural land across the continent. Applying a moisture tracking model (UTRACK) and a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL), we find that the Congo rainforest (>60 % tree cover) is a crucial moisture source for many agricultural regions. Although most of the rainforest acreage is in the DRC, many neighboring nations rely significantly on rainforest moisture for their rainfed agriculture, and even in remote places, rainforest moisture accounts for ∼10–20 % of agricultural water use. Given continuous deforestation and climate change, which impact rainforest areas and resilience, more robust governance for conserving the Congo rainforest is necessary to ensure future food production across multiple Sub-Saharan African countries.}

abstract = {Vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs). Deep learning-based approaches, especially those using transformer-based and generative models, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions. However, they often overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. Moreover, existing generative approaches in trajectory prediction are inefficient at conditioning predictions on relevant constraints. To address these issues, this study proposes FollowGen, a novel scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction. FollowGen incorporates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics within a generative framework, enhancing both the accuracy and realism of the predicted trajectories. The model uses a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle behaviors. It leverages a noise scaling conditioning strategy to scale the noise with encoded historical features within the forward diffusion process to ensure history-constrained noise transformation. A cross-attention-based transformer architecture is employed in the reverse process to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results in various real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.}

To date, such analyses have largely failed to engage with or incorporate insights from decolonial work, particularly concerning the legacies of coloniality persistent through planning institutions, knowledges, and practices. The research question that guides this paper is: What does it mean to decolonise the planning of NBS? In this literature review, we analyse how the topic of decoloniality is treated with regard to the planning of nature, ecosystems, and biodiversity, and we bring these insights into NBS practice. We synthesise the literature around questions regarding narratives of nature, the treatment of situatedness, and imagining ways out of coloniality in the planning of NBS. Our review argues that a decolonial approach to the planning of NBS is needed to address the root causes of climate change and shift our ways of relating to human and non-human others to enable a transformative approach to the planning, design, and implementation of NBS.}

My critical self-reflection paper seeks to understand the community's concerns and, thereby, to discern theoretical insights that conceptually contribute towards a theory of AC. Drawing on autoethnography, I identified three distinct perceived matters of concern represented by anthropomorphic personalities or faces of AC: Trickster, Surveyor, and Harbinger. The findings reveal that the Trickster is the most monstrous and disconcerting face of AC. It may be prankish or deceptive, but can also be beneficent and supportive. While the Surveyor provides surveillance, measurement, and calculation, the Harbinger announces competing future visions, one of utopian hope and the other of dystopian despair. I conclude by discussing the implications of three underlying theoretical variables: trust, creative value, and creative personal identity.}

abstract = {Background
There has been controversy over the extent to which technology use in general—and social media exposure specifically—may be associated with adverse youth mental health outcomes. To date, studies have generally been small and exploratory, relying on youth self-reports to characterize technology and social media use patterns. The goal of this study is to explore the associations between objectively collected data, gathered through a commercially available app, and youth mental health outcomes.
Objective
The broad goal of this study is to characterize the association between objectively measured technology/social media use and a range of mental health–related outcomes. Three specific aims will be initially addressed. First, we aim to quantify the association between objectively measured smartphone use and measures of well-being. Second, we aim to differentiate types of engagement—specifically, the types of content consumed versus the overall time spent on the device—and examine their association with outcomes. Third, we aim to identify moderating factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, that might influence these relationships. A secondary broad objective of this research is to establish a freely available data resource that can be accessed by qualified investigators to address a much wider range of questions in the future.
Methods
Up to 1000 male, female, and nonbinary youth aged 8-17 years (inclusive), along with their primary caregivers, will be enrolled in the study. Youth participants must have their own dedicated iOS- or Android-based smartphone or tablet, and both they and their parents must be willing and able to download and install the data collection app on their devices. The study is open to all US-based participants who meet these 2 criteria. Following electronic consent (eConsent), participants and their caregivers will complete a range of baseline measures electronically, including assessments of psychiatric and social functioning, as well as measures of loneliness, digital stress, and disordered eating. Caregivers will be asked to provide information on the participant’s health and mental health history. Youth and caregivers will then complete a similar battery of assessments 1, 2, and 3 months after baseline. Youth participants will also respond to daily questions about their mood, stress, physical activity, and sleep. Both youth and their caregivers will be compensated for completing measures at each time point. The data collection app gathers a wide range of daily data from the participant’s device, including temporal patterns of use, the number and frequency of various app usage, social interactions within apps, and keystroke data. A variety of analytic methods will be used to address key questions related to how technology and social media use are associated with mental health and wellness outcomes.
Results
Enrollment for this study began on November 13, 2024. As of May 20, 2025, a total of 106 participants and their caregivers had consented to participate and provided baseline data. An additional 203 children and parents have consented and are currently undergoing eligibility verification and enrollment. Initial data analysis is anticipated to begin in late autumn 2025 or winter 2026, with the expected publication of initial findings in spring 2026.
Conclusions
This study will be among the largest to date to collect both objective device usage data and validated, clinically relevant outcome measures. In accordance with our data-sharing policies, any qualified investigator will be able to access the study data, provided appropriate steps are followed.

Additionally, open-ended responses from all 258 participants provided insights into students’ perspectives on factors affecting their reading compliance. Results indicate that academic listening ability had a large effect on lecture comprehension whereas the effect for reading compliance was small. Moreover, academic reading expectancy and value were identified as having only a small effect on pre-lecture reading compliance.

abstract = {When not effectively addressed, ambivalence in customers can lead to various negative outcomes, such as decreased loyalty or purchase intent. Despite this, current research has yet to account for approaches that govern ambivalent customer behavior. To close this gap, we introduce a novel research conceptualization that considers a customer’s engagement with technology as an interaction with instrumental, symbolic, identity, and aesthetic cues. Building on the results of a hermeneutic literature review and construction of a pathway model, we demonstrate the potential of a cue-based design approach for Customer Facing Technologys (CFTs). The cue-based design emphasizes the reinforcing or oppositional interactions of signals surrounding the engagement with technology, making it possible to address ambivalence. Ultimately, we propose reconsidering the way CFTs are currently investigated in research to help explain deviations in customer behavior.}

In light of the ever-increasing opportunities associated with new digital technologies, an emerging body of knowledge examines how and under what circumstances organizations leveraging business process management (BPM) can be receptive to and supportive of digital innovation-related opportunities. In this study, we ask: How can BPM be set up to enable digital innovation on a continuous basis?
Design/methodology/approach
We conduct an inductive study with top executives in Central Europe. Our multi-method research consists of a Delphi study and two rounds of follow-up interviews.
Findings
We theorize that BPM can enable digital innovation along four dimensions: organizational IT application portfolio, organizational structure, organizational culture and organizational capabilities. Based on this, we provide four conjectures on how BPM can enable digital innovation.
Originality/value
Our study adds to the emerging debate around the connection between BPM and digital innovation by specifying how organizations can implement digital innovation initiatives while maintaining efficient and effective workflows.}

Drawing on recent conceptual insights into dialogic and hybrid intelligent feedback, the proposed model integrated GenAI into PF processes to assist students in generating, discussing, and re-formulating feedback comments. A total of 74 Chinese EFL undergraduates participated in this mixed-methods experimental study, which was embedded within a 17-week writing course. Thirty-six students from a class were assigned to the experimental group (using the GenAI-supported dialogic model), while thirty-eight from another class were assigned to the control group (engaging only in dyadic dialogic PF). The study adopted a three-pronged data collection technique: (1) feedback-informed performance improvements were measured based on draft and revised versions of writing products across three writing tasks; (2) pre- and post-questionnaires were administered to assess changes in PF and writing self-efficacy beliefs; and (3) semi-structured interviews were conducted after the intervention to gather students' reflections on how the new PF model influenced their SRL. Findings revealed that the intervention promoted performance improvements, enhanced PF self-efficacy, and activated SRL at various stages of dialogic PF. However, no significant effects were observed on writing self-efficacy. The evaluation of the model's impact across three key functional areas of feedback highlights the potential of GenAI to systematically enhance PF in an EFL writing context. This study contributes meaningful implications for educators and researchers aiming to incorporate advanced technologies in formative PF.}

With more than 20 nucleic acid-based therapies that gained regulatory approval, advances in chemical modifications, sequence optimization, and novel delivery systems have propelled ONTs from research tools to clinical realities. ONTs, including siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, saRNA, miRNA, aptamers, and decoys, offer promising solutions for targeting previously “undruggable” molecules, such as transcription factors, and enhancing cancer immunotherapy by overcoming tumor immune evasion. The promise of ONT application in cancer treatment is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of the first oligonucleotide-based treatment to myeloproliferative disease. At the same time, there are challenges in delivering ONTs to specific tissues, mitigating off-target effects, and improving cellular uptake and endosomal release. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ONTs in clinical trials, emerging delivery strategies, and innovative therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the role of ONTs in immunotherapy and addressing hurdles that hinder their clinical translation. By examining advances and remaining challenges, we highlight opportunities for ONTs to revolutionize oncology and enhance patient outcomes.}

This study presents a framework for complementing these assessments with kinematic measurements using 3D pose estimation. A total 809 rising and 791 lying down posture transitions were recorded over 12 cubicles by 7 synchronized cameras and processed with 3D pose estimation locating the position of the poll, withers, T13 and sacrum. First, the displacement of the keypoints was used to detect phases of the posture transitions. This detection was compared with visual observations of 200 recordings. The average mean absolute difference in detected timestamps between human and machine across all phases was 0.5 s (average σ = 0.7) and was under 0.9 s for all phases. Second, indicators were scored based on spatial use and duration, and their distribution compared to existing thresholds. We observed that 59.9 % of rising bouts and 29.1 % of lying down bouts exceeded at least one threshold. Rising delay occurred in 2.8 % of rising bouts and backwards crawling in 59.2 %. Lying down duration exceeded the threshold in 28.9 % of bouts, and rear limbs shifting duration in 8.3 %. Side lunge had a binary threshold which was not adapted to continuous sensor data. Finally, we investigated the association between indicators and found distinct dimensions for head lunge and crawling. We conclude that 3D pose is useful to score posture transition indicators, and that several indicators should be used together to capture distinct dimensions.}

abstract = {In this study, a bio-derived photocatalyst—lignin‑carbon supported CuMnO2 (LC/CuMnO2)—is reported that degrades perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) by integrating adsorption on polar, micro/mesoporous carbon with redox-active CuMn sites. Material characterization (XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM/TEM, BET) revealed well-dispersed CuMnO2 nanodomains and abundant surface oxygen species on LC, while EPR and scavenger quenching identify •OH and O₂•− (with minor contributions from h+ and 1O₂) as the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under optimized conditions (pH 5, C₀ = 10 mg L−1, 0.5 g L−1 catalyst, 25 °C), LC/CuMnO2 (10 wt% oxide) achieves rapid PFAS destruction, reaching ~86 % and ~ 82 % removal within 120 min, respectively, while total organic carbon decreases to ~40–45 % of the initial value, evidencing substantial defluorination with partial mineralization. HPLC-MS unambiguously tracks stepwise chain-shortening: PFOA → PFHpA → PFHxA → PFPeA → PFBA → PFPrA → TFA → CO₂/H₂O/F−; PFOS follows dual routes of (i) progressive desulfonation to TFSA with SO₄2− release and (ii) desulfonation to PFOA before the carboxylate pathway. DFT Gibbs free-energy profiles rationalize the different initiation pathways: PFOS exhibits a lower barrier via CS bond cleavage (desulfonation), while PFOA requires higher-energy CF activation/carboxylate decarboxylation; both then converge to stepwise defluorination. The catalyst is robust over five cycles, retaining >75 % activity with Cu/Mn leaching <15/10 μg L−1 and only subtle XPS shifts, and it tolerates common background ions (1–10 mM). This lignin-enabled, earth-abundant platform provides a mechanistically grounded and scalable route for PFAS degradation in water.}

This study presents a comprehensive assessment of MP contamination in Saint (St.) Martin's Island, Bangladesh's largest coral island, revealing its occurrence, characteristics, and associated ecological and human health risks. MPs were quantified and characterized in surface water, sediment, and marine biota (fish, crustaceans, and seaweeds) using stereomicroscopy and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). MP characteristics were fibrous shape, size > 0.1 mm (except for seaweeds), and diverse coloration. Our results revealed significant MP contamination in all matrices: surface water (141.25 ± 35.26 MPs/L), sediment (580.83 ± 131.78 MPs/kg dry weight), and biota (28.03 ± 4.86 MPs/individual fish, 20.88 ± 5.44 MPs/individual crustacean, and 8.21 ± 2.53 MPs/individual seaweed). Risk evaluation through contamination factor (CF), Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and pollution load index (PLI) revealed pollution levels from low to very high, with polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) being predominant. Among the biota, Glossogobius giuris (fish), Panulirus polyphagus (crustacean), and Caulerpa taxifolia (seaweed) exhibited the highest MP contamination within their respective groups. Estimated daily intake (EDI) calculations indicated that children are potentially exposed to approximately three times more MPs than adults through consumption of contaminated seafood (children: 18.11 ± 3.19, 13.65 ± 3.17, and 2.84 ± 0.87 MPs/day for fish, crustaceans, and seaweeds, respectively; adults: 4.49 ± 0.87, 3.72 ± 0.86, and 0.78 ± 0.23 MPs/day, respectively). These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted mitigation strategies, offering a scalable framework for addressing MP contamination in coastal ecosystems globally.}

Addressing this gap, the study examines how IGS can act as pivotal sites for reshaping urban planning paradigms, promoting spatial justice, and facilitating bottom-up governance. Using a case study of Jiulongyuan Community, located on the urban fringe of Hefei City, the research employs in-depth interviews and non-participatory observation to trace the emergence and evolution of guerrilla gardens through four distinct stages. Findings reveal that community residents use guerrilla gardening as a from of everyday resistance, challenging traditional top-down planning structures and generating new forms of spatial and political agency. This study contributes contemporary urban planning theory by emphasizing the role of value co-creation, grassroots spatial interventions, and the aesthetic order embedded in informal green practices.}

This study addresses this gap by examining how generative art affects consumers' approach intentions in metaverse-based virtual stores. Grounded in art infusion theory, two experiments using a 2 × 2 between-subjects design were conducted to test the effects of generative art in virtual fashion retail settings. The results of Study 1 (N = 120) reveal that the presence of generative art enhanced store visit intentions by increasing perceived exclusivity and aesthetic pleasure, with this effect moderated by brand type (mass vs. luxury). The results of Study 2 (N = 90) revealed that the dynamism of generative art positively influenced word-of-mouth intentions through two mediators, with the effect moderated by consumers’ artistic openness (low vs. high). This study contributes to the retail literature by identifying generative art as a novel environmental cue that enhances consumer experience, with its effectiveness shaped by both contextual and individual factors. Moreover, the findings provide practical insights for retailers and service providers seeking to leverage generative art as an affordable and sustainable tool to foster positive consumer responses.}

This approach compensates for the lack of information in the small target dataset by pre-training the model on a large source dataset. However, when the target dataset is further reduced to a small-sample size, existing methods struggle to maintain the performance of the transfer model, leading to rapid performance deterioration. To address this drawback, we propose PMSS, a Projection Module based on the Shape Space theory, to enhance the transfer model’s capability in small-sample scenarios. We first pre-train the model on the source dataset and save it, then use the pre-trained model to extract features from the target dataset. These extracted features, originally in the Euclidean space, are projected into the pre-shape space through PMSS for subsequent training. Furthermore, a class-aware attention mechanism is introduced during the learning process, enhancing the feature representation to improve the model’s ability to handle small-sample tasks. Extensive experiments on 10 backbone networks and 5 datasets demonstrate PMSS’s effectiveness. Specifically, PMSS achieved accuracy improvements of 6 %, 8 %, and 13 % on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and their small-sample subsets respectively. PMSS’s plug-and-play design requires no architectural changes, making it directly applicable to real-world systems with limited data. When compared with the latest manifold learning methods and robust transfer learning methods, PMSS achieves the state-of-the-art performance.}

abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the reproducibility of primary data and, the reproducibility and correctness of pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates reported in a sample of diagnostic meta-analyses.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted an exemplary systematic review of diagnostic meta-analyses comparing coronary computed tomography angiography to invasive coronary angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The objectives were to assess 1) the reproducibility of contingency tables, 2) the reproducibility of pooled sensitivity and specificity, and 3) differences to reported results when applying a recommended bivariate binomial model for pooling sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, we reproduced the contingency tables and recalculated sensitivity and specificity by utilizing both the pooling method of each meta-analysis and a bivariate binomial model. We used linear trends to assess the improvement of these objectives over time.
Results
We identified 38 diagnostic meta-analyses, each including on average 19 primary studies (range: 3 to 89 studies; total: 715—including duplicates) with an average of approximately 1800 patients per meta-analysis (range: 118 to 7516 patients). For 31 meta-analyses (82%, 95% CI: 65%, 91%), the contingency tables were reproducible; however, only 15 published them. Using the pooling method of each meta-analysis, we obtained comparable recalculated sensitivities/specificities for 28 meta-analyses (74% [57%, 86%]). Only 11 meta-analyses pooled sensitivity/specificity using a bivariate binomial model (29% [16%, 46%]). When all meta-analyses were pooled with this model, published sensitivities/specificities were confirmed for 19 of 38 meta-analyses (50% [34%, 66%]). There was only marginal improvement in data availability and application of recommended pooling methods over time.
Conclusion
Data sharing should become standard practice along with the use of appropriate pooling methods. Journal publication requirements may play a key role in enhancing the quality of scientific reporting and methodological standards which may lead to more reliable and consistent outcomes. The ability to reproduce sensitivity and specificity estimates in diagnostic imaging meta-analyses is dependent on the availability of contingency tables and the explicit reporting of pooling methods and software used.}

Integral to the macrophage stress response is the recognition of hypoxia and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are often coupled. The age-specific, cell-intrinsic nature of this stress response remains vague. To uncover age-defined divergences in macrophage crosstalk potential after exposure to hypoxia and PAMPs, we interrogated the secreted proteomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages via non-biased mass spectrometry. Through this approach, we newly identified age-specific signatures in the secretomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages in response to hypoxia and the prototypical PAMP, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neonatal macrophages secreted proteins most consistent with an anti-inflammatory, regenerative phenotype protective against apoptosis and oxidative stress, dependent on hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α). In contrast, adult macrophages secreted proteins consistent with a pro-inflammatory, glycolytic phenotypic signature consistent with pathogen killing. Taken together, these data uncover fundamental age and HIF-1α dependent macrophage responses that may be targeted to calibrate the innate immune response during stress and inflammation.}

To do so, we conducted a scoping review of scholarly and grey literature due to the emerging nature of this topic and the evidence on it, in order to summarise existing knowledge and understand the gaps in theory and policymaking; as well as qualitative online interviews with professionals with expertise in technology, child protection, social work, law and policymaking that were informed by our scoping review and aimed to further explore the gaps and themes that arose through our examination of emerging literature. Evidently, the risks arising from Extended Reality may impact all layers of a child's ecology and may therefore have long-term repercussions for children, negatively affecting their growth and welfare, as well as their immediate and wider environments. Given the multidimensionality of these harms, preventative and responsive efforts need to follow an equally multidimensional approach to safeguard children in these new, immersive online worlds.}

The HBsAg is generally present in the bloodstream of individuals with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It is classically known as the HBV infection marker, and is therefore the first marker to be investigated in the laboratory in the clinical hypothesis of infection by this agent. One of the factors that compromises the HBsAg detection in the bloodstream by the assays adopted in serological screening in both clinical contexts is the loss of S protein antigenicity. This can occur due to mutations that emerge in the HBV genome regions that encode the S protein, especially for its immunodominant region – the ‘a’ determinant. These mutations can induce exchanges of amino acid residues in the S protein's primary structure, altering its tertiary structure and the antigenic conformation, which may not be recognized by anti-HBs antibodies, compromising the infection diagnosis. In addition, these exchanges can render ineffective the anti-HBs antibodies action acquired by vaccination, compromise the effectiveness of the chronically HBV infected patient's treatment, and also the HBsAg immunogenicity, by promoting its retention within the cell. In this review, the residues exchange that alter the S protein's structure is revisited, as well as the mechanisms that lead to the HBsAg antigenicity loss, and the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological consequences of this phenomenon.}

This ecological engineering technology appears particularly ideal for low-income regions. In this study, three widely used CW types (horizontal flow, vertical flow, and hybrid CW) were constructed and evaluated for their effectiveness in removing various pollution parameters (BOD5, COD, TSS, NH4-N, NO3-N, and TP) from an industrial effluent. Different configurations were tested such as CW type, hydraulic residence time, plants presence, and artificial aeration. Results showed that the hybrid CW configuration (i.e., vertical flow CW followed by horizontal subsurface flow CW) achieved the highest removal rates of all pollutants, i.e., more than 90% of BOD5, COD, TSS, and NH4-N. The single horizontal flow and vertical flow CW designs showed variations in the removal of NO3-N and TP (less than 30%), which were significantly improved (50% and 70%, respectively) by using the hybrid CW system. Artificial aeration significantly improves the performance of the CW system, especially for ammonia nitrogen and organic matter removal, while plants presence is also beneficial in the treatment performance. An 8-days HRT seems to be adequate for high removal rates in passive CW designs, though in aerated wetlands a lower HRT of 4 days seems sufficient. These findings suggest that the hybrid CW system could be a promising option for efficient wastewater treatment in developing regions.}

This transition is supported by advancements in automation and more recently, Generative AI. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for intuitive human–robot interaction through natural language. However, the use of natural language as a means remains very limited due to the ambiguous natural language, environmental noise, pronunciation variability, and multiple phrasing styles. Furthermore, cloud-based deployment of LLMs raises concerns about ergonomics and data privacy, especially for industries and countries governed by strict regulatory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a fully offline, closed-loop robotic assistant for visual inspection tasks in HRC settings. The system supports speech-based interaction, where user instructions are transcribed via a Speech-to-Text (STT) model and processed by a locally deployed, code-generating LLM. Guided by a structured prompt, the LLM produces custom responses for robot perception and manipulation. Inspection paths are generated relative to spatial axes or in specific directions and executed with real-time feedback through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) interface, allowing for a much closer interaction with the robot assistant. The system applies a hybrid control method, where the higher-level instructions are generated by LLM along with a perception pipeline, and the lower-level robot control is managed by ROS for safety and reliability. The system is evaluated across a range of experiments, including local LLM comparisons, prompt engineering effectiveness, and inspection performance in both simulated and real-world industrial use cases. Results demonstrate the system’s capability to handle complex inspection tasks on objects with varied sizes and geometries, confirming its practicality and robustness in realistic deployment settings.

Variability in sleep patterns between weekdays and weekends, along with day-to-day fluctuations, is prevalent among children and adolescents. These inconsistencies have been hypothesized to contribute to obesity within this demographic. However, a comprehensive synthesis of evidence remains lacking.
Data synthesis
This systematic review and meta-analysis focused on observational studies investigating the associations between weekday-to-weekend and day-to-day sleep differences and adiposity-related measures. Five major databases were searched from their inception to April 2024. The effect sizes and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were pooled using the profile likelihood model and the quality effect model. Thirty-seven studies, comprising 197873 participants, met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The profile likelihood model indicated that, compared to the lowest group, individuals in the highest group of social jetlag, defined as the difference in sleep-wake timing between weekdays and weekends, showed increased BMI (body mass index)-z score (β: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.07), percentage fat mass (β: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.39), and odds of overweight/obesity (odds ratio: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.53). However, after adjusting for study quality, these associations became non-significant. Additionally, weekday-to-weekend bedtime difference was significantly and positively associated with BMI-z (β: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.10). Elevated intradaily variability was linked to the prevalence of overweight/obesity, whereas bedtime standard deviation was related to higher BMI-z, waist circumference and percentage fat mass, with limited data available.
Conclusion
Social jetlag and weekday-to-weekend bedtime differences may play a role in the development of obesity in children and adolescents. However, further studies with higher quality are needed to clarify these relationships.}

Hazard assessment is important for a wide range of scientific and industrial processes, particularly in oil and gas simulation and production. In this study, we report the geometric characteristics of faults in a shale gas region and perform plane and surface fitting using singular value decomposition and Gaussian process regression, respectively. The critical pore pressure and equivalent density of the critical pore pressure for fault slip were calculated using Coulomb's law, and the influence of parameter uncertainty was evaluated. Based on the relationship between the seismic event and fault, a list of the top 10 faults with seismicity was presented. Finally, geometric data, equivalent density, seismic events, and fault relationships were integrated. Comprehensive fault hazards were evaluated using the principal component analysis method. The results revealed that the fault area in the southeast was large and the depth reached the basement. Most faults tended NE, which was in the direction of easy failure and fault slip. The F92 fault has several seismic events and releases the most energy, ranking first in the top 10 hazardous fault list. These results potentially contribute to determining shale gas well location and trajectory design and reducing seismic hazards. This study enhances our understanding of fault hazard assessments.}

Drug repurposing, leveraging pre-approved antibiotics for novel applications, is a promising strategy to address this challenge. Antibiotics designed to combat bacterial infections can inhibit microbial activity and target cellular mechanisms associated with oncogenesis. Chronic bacterial infections, such as those caused by Salmonella typhi, Helicobacter pylori, and Escherichia coli, contribute significantly to gallbladder, gastric, kidney, and bladder cancers. These infections induce inflammation, DNA damage, and the disruption of cellular pathways, promoting the development of cancer. Antibiotics such as doxycycline, rifampicin, and azithromycin demonstrate anticancer properties by inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and regulating key pathways including the interleukin (IL)-6 signaling pathway and autophagy-related pathways. This dual action enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy and addresses bacteria-induced oncogenesis, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional drug discovery. Herein, we review the intricate mechanisms by which bacteria-induced cancer arises and explore the groundbreaking potential of repurposing antibiotics as dual-action therapies in oncology. By elucidating the pivotal role of biofilms in persistent infections and highlighting untapped therapeutic opportunities in antibiotic repurposing, this review underscores a transformative approach to cancer treatment.

Continuous air quality monitoring confirmed that average IAQ index values ranged from 34 to 50, CO₂ levels averaged 454–557 ppm, and PM₂.₅ concentrations rarely exceeded 15 μg/m³ . Nevertheless, behavioral and perceptual data from surveys, interviews, and QR-based tracking revealed limited terrace use and a persistent desire for “fresh air,” environmental variability, and sensory richness. When terraces were used, they functioned primarily as recreational or social spaces rather than work environments, constrained by glare, noise, poor ergonomics, and a lack of supportive infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that technical benchmarks, while necessary, are insufficient to ensure well-being. Instead, more effective workplace strategies must therefore move beyond narrowly defined performance metrics to embrace environmental diversity, occupant perception, and cultivate more porous boundaries between the indoors and nature.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aims to establish the correlation between shifts in serum trace element (TE) levels and the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), while also exploring the underlying causal relationship between these variables.
Methods
An investigation was conducted, which included a systematic review, a meta-analysis of observational studies, and a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study.
Results
This meta-analysis revealed significant differences in serum levels of copper, manganese, cadmium, and selenium between OA patients and healthy controls, after adjusting for heterogeneity. Specifically, significant disparities were observed for copper (SMD 0.118 [95 % CI: 0.061 ∼ 0.175], P < 0.001), manganese (SMD −0.180 [95 % CI: −0.326 ∼ −0.034], P = 0.016), cadmium (SMD 0.227 [95 % CI: 0.131 ∼ 0.322], P < 0.001), and selenium (SMD −0.138 [95 % CI: −0.209 ∼ −0.068], P < 0.001), while zinc levels did not show a significant difference (SMD −0.02 [95 % CI: −0.077 ∼ 0.038], P = 0.503). Further, MR analysis suggested a causal link between genetically predicted serum copper level changes and OA development, but not for other TEs.
Conclusion
The study suggests that there is an association between the occurrence of OA and variations in serum levels of copper, manganese, cadmium, and selenium. Elevated serum copper may play a pivotal role. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of TE level modulation in OA management.}

abstract = {Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is typically resistant to nearly all current therapies. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and dataset analyses identified Centrosomal Protein 55 (CEP55) as a critical factor in the transformation from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to CRPC and, ultimately, NEPC. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses and validation with clinical samples demonstrated that CEP55 is significantly upregulated in NEPC tissues compared to HSPC and CRPC. Furthermore, while CEP55 does not appear to be associated with the immune microenvironment or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), our findings indicate that it directly mediates the plasticity of prostate cancer cells, thereby promoting NEPC progression. Specifically, in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that CEP55 enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and the expression of NEPC biomarkers in prostate cancer. Importantly, although cisplatin is the primary treatment for NEPC clinically, CEP55 has been shown to regulate cisplatin resistance through the phosphorylation of CDK1 at the tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) site. In summary, our study identifies a key gene that influences the neuroendocrine differentiation process in prostate cancer, suggesting its potential as an important therapeutic target.}

abstract = {Drilling fluids are complex suspensions of particles with a wide diameter range. While extensive research has explored the rheological behavior of drilling fluids, several limitations still exist. High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions encountered in drilling fluids have introduced unique challenges, and only a few studies have attempted to develop a comprehensive equation that addresses both aspects concurrently. This study aims to perform a rheological characterization of a water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) containing xanthan gum under HPHT conditions and propose a constitutive equation to fit rheological data in such conditions. The experiments were conducted using an Anton Paar MCR 702TD rotational rheometer, coupled with a pressure cell. Steady-state flow curves were obtained at three different temperatures (25, 55, and 100 °C) and pressures ranging from 100 to 800 bar. The experimental data were fitted to the power-law model, and the rheological parameters of the model were fitted with variations in temperature and pressure. The fluid exhibited shear-thinning behavior, with the influence of temperature being more predominant than the effect of pressure, however, both variables have a strong relationship. Furthermore, we proposed a methodology to establish an equation capable of predicting the shear stress of the drilling fluid under HPHT conditions. The equation was also compared with different drilling fluids tested on different rheometers. This equation demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy within the fitted range. The insights provided in this study hold substantial implications for the oil and gas industry, as predicting the rheological behavior of drilling fluids under varying temperatures and pressures within the annular region of the well is essential for efficient drilling planning, particularly in offshore fields.}

In Experiment 1, using seven pigeons, the effect of stimulus continuity, the presentation of the same stimulus (background color of the computer screen) during the post-reinforcer delay period as in the pre-reinforcer delay period, was examined. In Experiment 2, the effect of stimulus continuity was examined under the conditions where a response was required (FR 1) to initiate the post-reinforcer delay using eight pigeons. The experimental results indicated that when the same stimulus as in the pre-reinforcer delay was presented continuously during the post-reinforcer delay and a response was required to start the post-reinforcer delay, the subjects showed relatively high sensitivity to differences between post-reinforcer delays. The implications of the results are discussed from a new perspective for the analysis of self-control choices.}

This research aims to contribute to this knowledge by assessing the effect of temperature and water availability along the growing cycle on grape quality and in particular on the phenolic compounds and their extractability. The research was carried out in a commercial vineyard in La Mancha Designation of Origen (Spain) planted with Merlot. Edaphoclimatic characteristics and the grape composition at maturity were evaluated for several years in the period 2007–2017. An increase in temperature decreased the content of phenolic compounds, while higher water availability contributed to increase their levels in the grapes. Total anthocyanin content was mainly affected by minimum temperature before veraison while extractable anthocyanin, flavonols and total polyphenols were affected by both maximum and minimum temperature during ripening. Higher water availability decreased the concentration of anthocyanins but favoured their extractability, while flavonols were not significantly affected by water availability. Thus, phenolic ripening can be affected by changes in temperature and water distribution throughout the growing cycle, but due to the opposite sign of their effect they may be partially balanced. The projected warmer conditions can affect phenolic composition of Merlot and therefore quality of the wines made with such variety. In order to maintain grape quality, strategies to reduce heat stress should be adopted, and irrigation doses and timing should be adapted not only in the ripening period but also in the period prior to veraison.}

Practical industrial process data are mostly nonlinear, dynamical, and manifested as temporal correlation, which makes it challenging for traditional monitoring methods to accurately capture the changes in internal state variables. To this end, a multi-block whitening slow feature analysis (MBW-SFA) approach is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the cross maximum information coefficient (CMIC) for nonlinear correlation analysis, blocking, as well as selective whitening transformation (SWT) for the nonlinear and strongly coupled process variables, so as to avoid the information loss caused by global whitening. The proposed MBW-SFA approach performs manifold mapping on the data with strong correlations, preserving key information while reducing dimensionality, and the selective whitening transformation is applied to prevent information loss across different variables. In addition, for scenarios involving partially known fault data, this study proposes a control limit optimization (CLO) function that balances fault identification and false alarms to calculate control limit thresholds based on slow feature monitoring statistics, achieving objective monitoring of industrial processes. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on Tennessee Eastman process, where the correlation between process variables is investigated, and the results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in process monitoring.}

abstract = {Background
Cataract surgeries are among the most performed surgeries worldwide. A thorough patient education is essential to inform patients about the perioperative process and postoperative target results concerning the intraocular lens and objectives for visual outcomes. However, addressing all relevant aspects and questions is time-consuming. Mobile apps can facilitate this process for both patients and physicians and thus be beneficial. However, the success of such an app depends on its user friendliness and acceptance by patients.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the user friendliness and acceptance of a cataract surgery education app on mobile devices among patients undergoing cataract surgery, the characteristics of patients who benefit the most from app use, and the influence of the app on patient satisfaction with treatment.
Methods
All patients who underwent cataract surgery at an ophthalmological practice from August 2020 to July 2021 were invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Out of 493 invited patients, 297 (60.2%) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized into 3 different groups. Half of the patients were offered to participate in Group 1 with use of the “Patient Journey” app. However, if they decided not to use the app, they were included in Group 2 (app denial). The other half of the patients were included in Group 3 (control) with no use of the app and with information provided conventionally. The app provided general information on the ophthalmological center, surgeons, cataract, and treatment options. Different questionnaires were used in all 3 groups to evaluate satisfaction with the perioperative process. Group 1 evaluated the app. Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and educational degree, were assessed.
Results
Group 1 included 77 patients (median age 69 years). Group 2 included 61 patients, and their median age was higher (median age 79 years). Group 3 included 159 patients (median age 74 years). There was no difference in satisfaction with the perioperative process and clinic between the 3 groups. Almost all app users appreciated the digital details provided for the organization and the information on the surgery. Age did not play a major role in appreciation of the app. Female patients tended to appreciate the information provided more than male patients. Patients who did not have a higher university degree experienced more benefits from the informational content of the app and were the most satisfied with the information. However, male patients and academics were in general more aware of technology and handled the app more easily.
Conclusions
The app showed high user friendliness and acceptance, and could particularly benefit specific patient groups. App users demonstrated a noninferior high satisfaction with the treatment in the ophthalmological center in comparison with patients who were informed about the surgery only conventionally.}

abstract = {The dynamic modulus is a fundamental property in pavement engineering, quantifying the viscoelastic stiffness of asphalt mixtures under cyclic loading and critical in mechanistic-empirical design frameworks for modeling pavement responses to traffic loads and temperature variations. However, its in-situ measurement remains costly, time-consuming, and technically demanding, creating a pressing need for accurate and efficient predictive models. Traditional machine learning approaches have been explored to estimate the dynamic modulus, but their predictive capabilities are often constrained by scarce, heterogeneous datasets, limiting generalization. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid learning framework that integrates Attention Based Tabular Network (TabNet)-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) with Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) for synthetic data augmentation. The framework leverages TabNet’s attention-based deep feature representation and XGB’s boosting capabilities to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness under data-scarce conditions. A comprehensive evaluation using different statistical metrics demonstrated that the proposed model trained on CTGAN-synthesized data consistently outperformed models trained solely on real data and those using alternative augmentation methods, achieving a superior coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.98. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis further identified Marshall Stability (28.7 %), Flow (18.8 %), and asphalt content (13.4 %) as the most influential features in dynamic modulus prediction. The CTGAN-augmented proposed hybrid model reduced Mean Absolute Erro by 67.30 %, improved R² by 13.27 %, and decreased Standard Error Ratio by 59.38 %, reflecting significant improvements across all evaluation metrics. These findings highlight the transformative potential of GAN-based data augmentation to advance predictive modeling and promote more efficient data-driven practices in pavement engineering.}

Analyzing data from 28 studies (N = 52,116), the study reveals that both organizational factors (technology, support, environment) and individual factors (cognition, emotion, adaptability, social skills) significantly influence employees' intentions to work alongside robots. Additionally, gender, educational attainment, and the timing of the pandemic exerted significant moderating effects. Female employees and those with higher education levels were more susceptible to workplace dynamics, while skill-related factors exerted a stronger influence prior to the pandemic. The findings extend UTAUT by highlighting the importance of contextual variables and individual differences in shaping employees' acceptance of service robots. Practically, it is recommended that hotels develop differentiated human-machine collaboration strategies based on employee characteristics and organizational conditions to better respond to automation trends.}

As artificial intelligence technologies evolve, data-driven methods have become mainstream for estimating SOC. However, the technique can significantly deteriorate model performance when encountering poor or insufficient data quality. In this paper, we apply median filtering to eliminate extreme noise and utilize continuous wavelet transform to extract time-frequency features from voltage signals. Additionally, we generate novel features via feature crossing. We then apply dimensionality reduction via the random forest method to decrease computational expense. Finally, we select a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base model to learn optimized features for more precise SOC estimation. To confirm the efficacy of our proposed method, this study compares it with CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BILSTM), and a CNN-BILSTM model combined with an attention mechanism. These comparisons are conducted under different temperatures and operating conditions. The results indicate that this method achieves a mean absolute error and a root mean square error of less than 2.89 % and 3.71 %, respectively, in SOC estimation, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to other models. This study underscores the significance of feature engineering techniques in SOC estimation.}
