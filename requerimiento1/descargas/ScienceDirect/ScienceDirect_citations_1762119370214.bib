Many studies have been done to shed insight into the existing state of mobile learning (M-learning) studies. However, further research is needed into this topic at a specific time, i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to retrieve, review, investigate, and critically assess the existing literature on M-learning that was conducted during the COVID-19 concerning our research theme. This study considered publications from four databases, narrowed our initial search results of 4056 articles down to 83 that are relevant to our research questions, and did an in-depth analysis based on the systematic review protocol. The findings explored the major focusing areas of M-learning applications, the regional sentiment of M-learning users, the determinants and perceptions of M-learning, as well as the benefits, challenges, and opportunities associated with M-learning. This systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to apportion a contribution toward an improved understanding of the basic principles that underpin the rethinking of M-learning applications for policymakers, online course designers, and blended learning facilitators.}

abstract = {The damage to asphalt mixture caused by freeze-thaw cycles significantly affects its mechanical performance. This has been verified by the experiment. However, the damage evolution mechanism of asphalt mixture under the influence of repeated freeze-thaw cycles is still unclear. In light of this, this paper employs micro-scale numerical simulation and experimental methods to study the freeze-thaw damage mechanism of asphalt mixture. A beam specimen was utilized to measure the frost heave strain. The volume change of air voids caused by repeated freezing and thawing was described through the equivalent expansion coefficient, which was derived based on the content of air voids. A FE meso model of asphalt mixture was reconstructed using CT scanning technology and image processing technique. The internal damage evolution laws and mechanical properties of asphalt mixture were analyzed through FE simulation. Results indicate that with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles, the moisture absorption of asphalt mixture continuously increases, gradually stabilizing after 7 cycles. The frost heave strain increases rapidly in the early stage of freeze-thaw cycling, and gradually slows down in the later stage. The proposed equivalent expansive coefficient effectively characterizes the internal damage of asphalt mixture under repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Under the action of freeze-thaw cycles, the mortar around the void cracks first. As the cycles increase, adjacent voids gradually connect, and the damaged area of the mixture further expands. Both numerical results and the measured results indicate that the strength of asphalt mixture is more susceptible to freeze-thaw cycles than the modulus. The freeze-thaw cycles lead to a reduction in the fracture threshold of asphalt mixture. The proposed method based on equivalent expansive coefficient is reasonable and feasible, with certain applicability and universality to other porous materials.}

First, we study the strength of collective dynamics during different market crises, and compare suitable portfolio diversification strategies with respect to the unique number of sectors and stocks for optimal systematic risk reduction. Next, we introduce a new linear operator method to quantify distributional distance between equity returns during various crises. Our method allows us to fairly compare underlying stock and sector performance during different time periods, normalising for those collective dynamics driven by the overall market. Finally, we introduce a new combinatorial portfolio optimisation framework driven by random sampling to investigate whether particular equities and equity sectors are more effective in maximising investor risk-adjusted returns during market crises.}

abstract = {Since its first demonstration more than a half century ago, magnetic levitation (MagLev) has gained eminent scientific attention from both the fundamental and applied points of view. In essence, MagLev shows highly nonlinear dynamics, described with nonlinear differential equations. Thus, in order to exploit the MagLev phenomenon, both mathematical models and control algorithms must be constructed. Frequently authors use simplifications of the model, and in doing so, limit the application of the MagLev model around a nominal operating point. In these simplified cases, the MagLev models may contain parameters that are not represented by proper physical quantities. Thus, in this work, we revised the issue of MagLev modelling from the first-principle approach. More specifically, we theoretically derived expressions for the interaction between the magnetic fields of the solenoid and a small magnetic object. The behaviour of the inductance on a distance from the solenoid was then described. The suggested MagLev modelling concept was verified experimentally, confirming the validity and correctness of the proposed MagLev mathematical model. The results presented here could thus be regarded as highly beneficial for formulating more complex MagLev designs exploitable in the field of model predictive control of the position of a levitating object.}

We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.}

This case study examines an experiential exercise involving 118 postgraduate management students at a UK business school, where students were asked to write a 500-word reflection on their use of AI for a 2500-word essay-style assessment. Using sensemaking as a theoretical lens, we compare students' claims with assessors' evaluations of students' AI usage. Our findings indicate that students predominantly use generative AI for writing, paraphrasing, and rephrasing, rather than for fostering critical thinking or engaging in the more advanced stages of sensemaking, a level achieved by only one-tenth of the cohort. The consistency between this study's findings and pre-generative AI research suggests that higher education has yet to adapt adequately in ways to integrate AI to mitigate, rather than exacerbate, current sector deficiencies. We call on university leaders to develop institutional strategies that allow for effective and responsible integration of generative AI, and on educators to develop students' critical evaluation and academic writing skills that build on generative AI's affordances, with several specific recommendations made in this article.}

Using the stimulus–organism–response model and flow theory, this study presents an analysis of the overall process of creative teaching's impact on student classroom engagement, proceeding from two types of flow experiences: immediate and continuous experiences. This empirical study was conducted in the institutions piloting creative teaching in China. The results affirm the following: first, the balance of challenges and skills, goal clarity and feedback in creative teaching all affect students’ immediate and continuous experiences significantly and positively. Second, immediate experiences have significantly positive effects on both behavioural and social engagement. Third, for science and engineering students, continuous experiences have significant effects on behavioural engagement and social engagement; however, these effects do not obtain for humanities and social science students. Fourth, there is no significant difference in the effects of creative teaching on engagement between male and female students. The potential contribution of this study is that we create a theoretical model of how creative teaching affects student engagement. Based on this model, educational administrators and teachers can understand the whole process of the impact of creative teaching on students’ behaviour.}

Aged type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are linked with lower serum levels of total antioxidant activity, magnesium and zinc, particularly under uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled oxidative stress is an established contributor to diabetic complications. Magnesium is a cofactor for ∼600 enzymes, while zinc is a part of ∼3000 human proteins, essential for intermediary metabolism. A multi-targeted approach combining β-carotene, Magnesium and Zinc (BMZ) with metformin or vitamin E, Magnesium and Zinc (EMZ) with metformin for daily use in aged rats with T2DM identified astonishing findings compared to metformin monotherapy. Over three months, compared to metformin monotherapy, BMZ with metformin provided excellent glycemic control, outstanding protection against potential neuropathy and sensorimotor coordination, maintained robust retinal integrity and provided significant control for diabetic nephropathy. Mechanistically, the significant improvement in BMZ with metformin in controlling retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are directly linked to (1) Increased glycemic control (antihyperglycemic effect), (2) increased insulin sensitivity as evidenced by reduced HOMA-IR levels, (3) reduced oxidative stress (4) increased antioxidant activity through increased glutathione levels and increased GSH/GSSG ratio, and (5) improved regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as evidenced by metabolomic data. This study provides robust and direct evidence to support the use of affordable, proven antioxidant and mineral combinations with metformin to reduce diabetes-related complications in aging.}

Since fibrous micro-plastics are reported to be detected in the lower respiratory tract and other body parts, the relationship of fibrous MP and asthma, as well as the potential mechanism is not well investigated. In this study, we produced fibrous MPs, whose lengths and widths were in accordance with the natural environment, and further, investigated the potential adverse effect of which on the asthma in a OVA (ovalbumin)-induced mice model, aiming at exploring the true life hazard of MP to the respiratory system. Following nasal exposure to fibrous MPs, the airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and fibrosis were aggravated in asthmatic mice. Fibrous MPs exposure also significantly increased the levels of total IgE, and, cardinal Th2 and Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines participated in the etiopathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. In addition, MP fibers exposure induced lung epithelial cells apoptosis, disruption of epithelial barrier integrity and activation of NLRP3 related signaling pathways. Moreover, fibrous MPs significantly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. Compared to the control group, the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Uncultured were decreased to 4.47% and 0.15% in OVA group, while Blautia and Prevotella were elevated to 4.96% and 2.94%. For the OVA + MPs group, the relative abundance of Blautia and Uncultured were decreased to 2.27% and 0.006%, while Prevotella was increased to 3.05%. Our study highlights the detrimental effect of fibrous MPs on asthmatic population and facilitates an indication of the latent mechanisms of fibrous MPs induced airway pathology.}

To ameliorate this situation, several computational methods were used to predict the structures of antibody:antigen complexes (Ab:Ag) and identify potential binders, in-silico. However, there is still a general lack of rapid virtual screening methods capable of screening large antibody libraries against a given antigen or group of antigens. In this work, we explore the application of a successful small-molecule drug discovery strategy and adapt pharmacophore-based virtual screening to the world of antibody discovery. Using a nonredundant data set of 874 Ab:Ag complexes, we have developed an automated method to create pharmacophores from the antibody complementarity determining regions. Our method is 98.6% (862 out of 874) successful at reproducing the ground truth, i.e., it can recapitulate the parental antibody:antigen complexes. In a benchmarking comparison with cognate docking, using 33 Ab:Ag complexes of therapeutic interest, the pharmacophore method was not only much faster than cognate docking but also recovered all the native interfacial contacts. In addition, it can also find additional putative antibody binders to a given antigen within clusters of Ab:Ag complexes with similar interfacial structures. Our method has significant implications toward accelerating biotherapeutic drug discovery as well as drug repurposing research. This method was implemented in MOE 2024 and is available to the scientific community.

This review article explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (ie, classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based nongenerative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed for their roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for analyzing whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, explainability, and reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.}

Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) are a treatment option for patients with advanced high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma (OC). Recent guidelines have clarified how homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may influence treatment decision-making in this setting. As a result, numerous companion diagnostic assays (CDx) have been developed to identify HRD. However, the optimal HRD testing strategy is an area of debate. Moreover, recently published clinical and translational data may impact how HRD status may be used to identify patients likely to benefit from PARPi use. We aimed to extensively compare available HRD CDx and establish a worldwide expert consensus on HRD testing in primary and recurrent OC.
Methods
A group of 99 global experts from 31 different countries was formed. Using a modified Delphi process, the experts aimed to establish consensus statements based on a systematic literature search and CDx information sought from investigators, companies and/or publications.
Results
Technical information, including analytical and clinical validation, were obtained from 14 of 15 available HRD CDx (7 academic; 7 commercial). Consensus was reached on 36 statements encompassing the following topics: 1) the predictive impact of HRD status on PARPi use in primary and recurrent OC; 2) analytical and clinical validation requirements of HRD CDx; 3) resource-stratified HRD testing; and 4) how future CDx may include additional approaches to help address unmet testing needs.
Conclusion
This manuscript provides detailed information on currently available HRD CDx and up-to-date guidance from global experts on HRD testing in patients with primary and recurrent OC.}

abstract = {After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), inflammation and other reactive processes exacerbate tissue damage and impair long-term motor recovery. Extracellular traps (ETs) are an immune cell effector function first described in neutrophils wherein chromatin is decondensed, decorated with cytotoxic granule enzymes, and expelled from the cell body. Recently, ETs have been linked to poor functional outcomes in SCI; however, translatable agents to prevent ET-mediated damage after SCI have yet to be explored. We assessed recombinant human (rh) DNase (trade name Pulmozyme) as a potential therapeutic that could be repurposed to break down ETs after SCI. To determine the timing of treatment, we characterized the timeline of ET formation in a thoracic contusion model of SCI in mice. We found that ETs levels increased in the injured spinal cord by 4 h post injury (hpi), peaking within 24 hpi. When rhDNase was administered at 1 hpi, DNase activity in the serum remained elevated for 24 hpi with a corresponding increase in circulating ET fragments. At 6 hpi, blood-spinal cord barrier permeability was attenuated in rhDNase-treated animals. Long-term functional hind limb recovery, as assessed by the ladder rung walking test, was improved at 35 dpi in rhDNase-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. RhDNase-treated animals also exhibited shorter SCI lesion lengths at 35 dpi. Altogether, our data demonstrate the potential of rhDNase as an anti-ET therapeutic to improve long-term SCI outcomes.}

During tissue repair or regeneration, several bioactive molecules are released and interact with each other and act as complex additives or inhibitors for tissue reconstruction. In this study, the bone-healing effects of the combination treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibition, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) release by gene silencing, and gene transfection with calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP) in the rat femoral head was histologically, morphologically, and biochemically evaluated.
Methods
A triple-functionalized paste of CaP carrying plasmid DNA encoding for BMP-7 and for VEGF), and siRNA against TNF-α was developed and denoted as CaP3mix. To compare the effects of 3mixCaP, CaP with plasmid DNA encoding BMP-7, VEGF, or siRNA encoding TNF-α was prepared and denoted as CaP/PEI/pBMP-7/SiO2, CaP/PEI/pVEGF/SiO2, or CaP/PEI/siRNA-TNF-α/SiO2, respectively. The bone healing in bone defects in the rat femoral head was investigated after 10 and 21 days of implantation.
Results
The levels of bone formation-related markers OCN, Runx2, and SP7 increased at the protein and gene levels in 3mixCaP after 10 days, and 3mixCaP significantly accelerated bone healing compared with the other treatments after 21 days of implantation.
Conclusion
The triple-functionalized CaP paste loading plasmid DNA encoding BMP-7 and VEGF and siRNA encoding TNF-α is a promising bioactive material for bone tissue repair.}

Considering the detrimental effects that cardiovascular disease has on the survival rate of cancer survivors, formal education and training in cardio-oncology are imperative to furnish healthcare practitioners with the knowledge and skills required to optimize cardiovascular outcomes. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of cardiac oncology, which combines elements of oncology and cardiology, trainees are required to possess in-depth comprehension of oncology/hematology principles and practice in addition to cardiovascular disease. Well-rounded cardio-oncologists (either oncologists or cardiologists) must understand cancer treatments' cardiovascular toxicities, cardiovascular risk assessment before, during, and after treatment, and cancer patients' unique cardiovascular disease management strategies. Advanced technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning health tools have the potential to integrate patients' clinical data, including diagnoses, to create educational materials and tools to improve their understanding of their medical needs. Interactive educational platforms that are powered by technology, such as mobile applications, online forums and portals, virtual reality, and social media, can furnish patients with conveniently accessed videos, virtual simulations, and educational content pertaining to cardiovascular health and cancer. This would greatly aid in raising awareness and improving their comprehension of the cardiovascular implications of cancer and its treatment.}

keywords = {emerging adulthood, design thinking, mental health promotion, mental ill-health, needs assessment, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
Young adults experience stressors in their transition to adulthood and are at increased risk of mental ill-health. This risk is compounded by young adults’ low levels of mental health literacy and limited competencies in implementing strategies promoting mental health and well-being in their daily lives. Previous research suggests that digital mental health apps may be particularly effective in increasing the mental health literacy of young adults. In Sweden, there is a lack of research on young adults’ unique perspectives on what constitutes mental health, well-being, and ill-health—perspectives that could inform the coproduction of evidence-based interventions targeting these issues.
Objective
The overarching aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment as part of coproducing a digital mental health app for Swedish young adults. More specifically, the study addressed two research questions: (1) What do Swedish young adults perceive as contributing to the mental health, well-being, and ill-health of themselves and their peers? (2) What are Swedish young adults’ preferences and ideas on how a digital mental health app can support their mental health during young adulthood, including their perspectives on the app’s usability?
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 young adults and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Of the 16 study participants, 9 (56%) identified as women and 7 (44%) as men. Their mean age was 23.6 (SD 4.22; range 18-29) years. Furthermore, 56% (9/16) were pursuing or had obtained a higher education degree, while 44% (7/16) had completed or were in the process of completing a high school diploma. The interviews and subsequent analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “To feel that life is worth living”—pathways through pressures and pursuit of mental well-being during young adulthood, (2) “A personal space for working on one’s own mental well-being”—digital companionship with others, and (3) “Something that is designed for me”—customizing one’s digital mental health journey.
Conclusions
In line with the preferences of Swedish young adults, the promotion of mental health and well-being through digital technology and eHealth should focus on a customizable app that supports balance in daily life while strengthening mental health competencies. The content should center on fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships and activities, addressing challenges such as negative social media use and stress recovery, and enhancing mental health knowledge and peer support. Future efforts should focus on researching young adults’ experiences of the life phase of emerging adulthood and its implications for mental health. In addition, future technical development and research on digital mental health apps should include the perspectives of stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, and involve prototype testing with diverse groups to ensure the app’s relevance, user engagement, and effectiveness.}

Building on this premise, this paper presents a framework for identifying breakthrough technologies that starts with these signals of scientific innovation. The first step in the method is to construct a science-technology knowledge network based on papers and patents. Then a two-stage selection method funnels the scientific innovation signals, filtering out those with the potential to trigger technological breakthroughs. Next, a machine learning-based link prediction model, integrating three types of features, identifies new links between science-driven signals and existing technologies. A community detection algorithm then identifies sub-networks of technologies formed around these new links. Finally, a structural entropy index is used to evaluate these sub-networks to determine potential breakthrough technologies. By systematically characterizing the content and core features of scientific innovation signals, this study reveals the driving sources of technological breakthroughs and sheds light on the absorption and diffusion processes of scientific innovation. We validated the method through a use case in the field of artificial intelligence. Those who manage technological innovation should find the insights of this research particularly valuable.}

We used relative frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), a method to measure functional lateralization of affective processing, to investigate psychobiological correlates of SFDs. With alpha activity being inversely related to cortical network activity, relative FAA refers to alpha activity on the right frontal lobe minus alpha activity on the left frontal lobe. Less relative left frontal activity, reflected by negative FAA scores, is associated with lower positive and greater negative affectivity, such as observed in depression. Due to its negative affective component (illness anxiety), we expected to find less relative left frontal activity pattern in SFDs, and positive associations with self-reported chronic stress and depression symptoms. We recorded resting-state EEG activity with 64 electrodes, placed in a 10–10 system in 26 patients with a primary SFD, 23 patients with a major depressive disorder and 25 healthy control participants. The groups did not differ in FAA. Nevertheless, across all participants, less relative left frontal activity was associated with chronic stress and depression symptoms. We concluded that FAA may not serve as an indicator of SFDs. As the relationship of FAA and depressive symptoms was fully mediated by chronic stress, future studies have to clarify whether the association between FAA and chronic stress may represent a shared underlying factor for the manifestation of mental health complaints, such as depression.}

abstract = {Background
Online record access (ORA) is being increasingly implemented internationally. Despite reported benefits for patients, health care professionals (HCPs) have raised concerns about potential disadvantages. To date, no review has examined the empirical evidence on whether and how documentation changes following the introduction of patients’ ORA.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to examine potential subjective and objective changes in HCPs’ documentation after using patients’ ORA.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using a methodological framework for scoping reviews and data from 4 electronic databases. Studies examining objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation following the implementation of ORA, specifically those related to actual use experiences (rather than previous expectations), up to July 2023, were included. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the included studies. The narrative synthesis and reporting of findings were guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results
Of the 3143 papers screened, 42 (1.34%) were included in this review. The included studies mainly used qualitative methods and were predominantly published after 2016 in the United States. The included studies were conducted in different settings (inpatient and outpatient) and clinical areas (somatic, mental health, and other). In total, 8 studies analyzed clinical notes, while the remaining studies focused on the experiences of patients, HCPs, and other stakeholders with ORA. Objectively, a decrease in complexity, an increase in readability, and a change in the emotional tone of the clinical notes were observed. The length of the clinical notes was observed to change both objectively and subjectively, although the direction of this change was inconclusive. However, many HCPs also reported writing notes that were less open and more restrictive to protect sensitive or hypothetical information. While for some HCPs the implementation of ORA made the clinical notes a less efficient and valuable working tool, others perceived that ORA opened up new therapeutic opportunities through direct contact with patients.
Conclusions
The question of whether an inherently uniform clinical note can meet the diverse needs of different health care stakeholders remains unresolved, highlighting the challenges of standardizing practices in this complex sector. While ORA may encourage HCPs to make their clinical notes more patient friendly, it may also compromise the integrity of documentation by omitting sensitive findings and expert judgment, which can put patients at risk and lead to errors that increase the risk of malpractice. Given the limitations of digital documentation in fostering trust, it is imperative to prioritize meaningful patient-HCP interactions. The use of compensatory measures, such as parallel documentation and restricted access to clinical notes, indicates systemic problems and suggests that current practices are suboptimal.

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the current use cases of large language models (LLMs) in musculoskeletal medicine and to evaluate the methodologic conduct of these investigations in order to safeguard future implementation of LLMs in clinical research and identify key areas for methodological improvement.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases to identify eligible studies. Included studies evaluated the use of LLMs within any realm of orthopaedic surgery, regardless of its application in a clinical or educational setting. Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria was used to assess the quality of all included studies.
Results
In total, 114 studies published from 2022 to 2024 were identified. Extensive use case redundancy was observed, and 5 main categories of clinical applications of LLMs were identified: 48 studies (42.1%) that assessed the ability to answer patient questions, 24 studies (21.1%) that evaluated the ability to diagnose and manage medical conditions, 21 studies (18.4%) that evaluated the ability to take orthopaedic examinations, 11 studies (9.6%) that analyzed the ability to develop or evaluate patient educational materials, and 10 studies (8.8%) concerning other applications, such as generating images, generating discharge documents and clinical letters, writing scientific abstracts and manuscripts, and enhancing billing efficiency. General orthopaedics was the focus of most included studies (n = 39, 34.2%), followed by orthopaedic sports medicine (n = 18, 15.8%), and adult reconstructive surgery (n = 17, 14.9%). ChatGPT 3.5 was the most common LLM used or evaluated (n = 79, 69.2%), followed by ChatGPT 4.0 (n = 47, 41.2%). Methodological inconsistency was prevalent among studies, with 36 (31.6%) studies failing to disclose the exact prompts used, 64 (56.1%) failing to disclose the exact outputs generated by the LLM, and only 7 (6.1%) evaluating different prompting strategies to elicit desired outputs. No studies attempted to investigate how the influence of race or gender influenced model outputs.
Conclusions
Among studies evaluating LLM health care use cases, the scope of clinical investigations was limited, with most studies showing redundant use cases. Because of infrequently reported descriptions of prompting strategies, incomplete model specifications, failure to disclose exact model outputs, and limited attempts to address bias, methodological inconsistency was concerningly extensive.
Clinical Relevance
A comprehensive understanding of current LLM use cases is critical to familiarize providers with the possibilities through which this technology may be used in clinical practice. As LLM health care applications transition from research to clinical integration, model transparency and trustworthiness is critical.

The biosynthesis of flavonoids is regulated by various transcription factors (TFs), with MYB TFs playing a key role in controlling essential genes within this pathway. In this study, we identified candidate MYB TFs from our pulp transcriptome database of durian ‘Monthong’ cultivar. MYBs exhibiting upregulation during the ripe stage were considered transcriptional activators, due to their positive correlation with flavonoid gene expression and flavonoid accumulation in ripe durian pulps. One candidate MYB activator, DzMYB1, which was highly expressed at the ripe stage, was selected for functional characterization. Studies involving transient expression of DzMYB1 in Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom fruit demonstrated increased flavonoid content, as analyzed by LC–MS/MS, compared with the GFP control. Moreover, we showed that DzMYB1 controls flavonoid biosynthesis by interacting with the promoters of various flavonoid biosynthetic genes, including chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase, resulting in their transcriptional activation. Additionally, we found that DzMYB1 functions as a homodimer and binds to a homodimerized DzbHLH1 in the intricate regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the functional roles of MYB protein in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway within durian pulps.}

The prevalent use of biological processes raises concerns due to potential environmental impacts caused by N2O emissions. However, partial nitritation-anaerobic ammonium oxidation demonstrated economic benefits and the potential for positive environmental outcomes when properly operated and controlled. Furthermore, reject water, in many cases, provides sufficient nitrogen concentrations for nitrogen recovery processes, such as ammonia stripping, substituting production of industrial fertilizers and contributing to a circular economy. Nonetheless, their financial competitiveness is subject to various conditions, including the nitrogen concentration or reject water flow. As the environmental benefits of bioprocesses and economic benefits of nitrogen recovery processes may vary, it is crucial to further optimize both and investigate novel promising technologies such as electrochemical systems, denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation or direct ammonia oxidation.}

Preclinical studies indicate that CDK4/6i may collaborate by influencing DNA damage repair pathways during radiotherapy. Since PARP1 expression was also significantly upregulated in NSCLC, we analyzed the efficacy of combining PARP1 and CDK4/6 inhibition in NSCLC models. We found that CDK4/6is synergize with PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis) to inhibit the clonogenic growth of RB-proficient NSCLC models. This synergy correlates with increased accumulation of DNA damage, interrupted cell-cycle checkpoints, and enhanced apoptotic cell death. Mechanistically, we showed that CDK4/6is promote PARP1 protein degradation, which lead to decreased availability of DNA repair factors involved in homologous recombination and suppression of DNA repair competency. Furthermore, we showed that PARP trapping is engaged in this synergy. We then confirmed that combining PARPi and CDK4/6i blocked the growth of NSCLC xenografts in vivo and patient-derived explant models ex vivo. Our data reveal a previously uncharacterized impact of CDK4/6i on PARP1 levels in RB-proficient NSCLC models and the engagement of PARP trapping in the synergy between CDK4/6i and PARPi. Our findings suggest combining CDK4/6i with PARPi could be a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with RB-proficient NSCLC.}

The study investigated the effectiveness of machine learning methods in air quality prediction, using the datasets from Shillong City in India. Key variables used in this study were particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), and ozone (O3). The machine learning methods used in this study were AdaBoost, LightGBM and Support Vector Machine. Correlation analysis of variables with the Air Quality Index (AQI) revealed that O3 and NO had weak correlations with the AQI (r = 0.37 and 0.01, respectively), which justified their exclusion from model construction. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets. LightGBM outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 0.86, whilst the AdaBoost had the second-best results. The Support Vector Machine had an accuracy of 0.827. This illustrates the usefulness of the LightGBM method in predicting air quality, providing knowledge for efficient air quality management. PM2.5 and PM10 had the greatest impact on LightGBM model results, and this illustrates the usefulness of monitoring these two air pollutants in air quality management. The LightGBM model proved to be very efficacious in predicting air quality in the given environment, considering the complex nature of the data. The model results may inform interventions for air pollution management in similar areas. Policies and regulations should therefore pay greater attention to sources of particulate matter pollution in Shillong City and develop appropriate interventions.}

abstract = {The human oral cavity harbors a diverse and dynamic microbial ecosystem, including bacteriophages (phages), which play a critical role in shaping the microbial community structure. Bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target and infect bacteria, have been increasingly recognized for their potential to influence both microbial balance and disease progression within the oral environment. Recent studies suggest that bacteriophages not only modulate the composition of the oral microbiome but also play an essential role in the pathogenesis and treatment of oral cancer. This review aims to explore the complex crosstalk between bacteriophages and oral health related to oral carcinogenesis, with a particular focus on their emerging roles in oral carcinogenesis and therapeutic interventions. Oral cancer, a major global health concern, is often associated with microbial dysbiosis and chronic inflammation, both of which contribute to tumor progression. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a key bacterial species implicated in oral carcinogenesis, has been shown to promote tumor growth, enhance immune evasion, and exacerbate inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. Bacteriophages offer a promising strategy to selectively target and eliminate such pathogenic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, thereby restoring microbial balance and reducing the pro-tumorigenic effects of bacterial infections. Through the disruption of tumor-associated biofilms and modulation of cancer-promoting bacterial populations, phages may help mitigate the inflammatory responses that drive oral cancer progression. Additionally, phage therapy could complement existing treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Beyond their direct antibacterial effects, genetically engineered bacteriophages present novel opportunities for targeted cancer therapy. Advances in synthetic biology have enabled the development of phages capable of delivering therapeutic payloads, such as anti-cancer peptides, cytotoxic agents, and immune modulators. These engineered phages can be designed to selectively target bacterial species that influence tumor progression, offering a highly specific and precision-based approach to oncology. Moreover, phages can serve as vectors for cancer vaccines, facilitating antigen presentation and enhancing immune responses against tumor cells. In addition to therapeutic applications, bacteriophages hold promise in the field of cancer diagnostics. The ability of phages to selectively bind to specific bacterial biomarkers associated with oral cancer could be leveraged for early disease detection and non-invasive screening. Phage-based biosensors, for instance, have shown potential in identifying cancer-associated microbial signatures, paving the way for innovative diagnostic tools that could improve early intervention and patient outcomes. Despite their potential, several challenges must be addressed before phage-based strategies can be fully integrated into clinical practice. Phage resistance, immune system clearance, and regulatory barriers pose significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of phage therapy. Additionally, the complex interactions between bacteriophages, host immunity, and the tumor microenvironment require further investigation to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety. Advancing research on bacteriophages in the context of oral cancer could revolutionize current treatment paradigms, providing more targeted, efficient, and patient-friendly alternatives to conventional therapies. By harnessing the natural specificity and adaptability of bacteriophages, clinicians and researchers can develop innovative approaches to combat oral cancer, ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes.}

Here, in 34 young adults (18 female; age from 19 to 26 years) with no prior caregiving experience, we used an infant cry feedback paradigm to characterize individual differences in behavioral adjustment and their neural correlates. Participants judged the cause of infant cries while their reaction time changes (ΔRT) and EEG were recorded. Our results revealed context-specific adjustment biases unique to infant cries, distinct from responses to animal vocalizations. Within the infant crying context, a negative-feedback bias (slowing after negative feedback) correlated with higher self-reported caregiving sensitivity, whereas a positive-feedback bias (slowing after positive feedback) correlated with lower caregiving motivation. Inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) further revealed a key asymmetry in neural responses, showing that higher negative-feedback bias was associated with greater inter-subject neural similarity during negative feedback (480–1000 ms) and positive feedback (600–700 ms), whereas higher positive-feedback bias was associated with more idiosyncratic neural patterns. Furthermore, a mediation analysis showed that the influence of the Late Positive Potential (LPP) on caregiving sensitivity was fully mediated by these behavioral adjustments, where lower LPP amplitudes predicted greater slowing after negative feedback, which in turn predicted higher intended infant caregiving sensitivity. These findings link specific behavioral adjustments to an asymmetric neural similarity structure, offering potential markers for caregiving dispositions and highlighting the importance of feedback processing in caregiver-infant interactions.}

However, the inherent complexities of composite materials and the multitude of parameters involved, render traditional design and optimization methods inadequate for achieving effective inverse design of composites. In this paper, we present an AI-based inverse design framework that effectively and efficiently generates FRPCs with targeted nonlinear stress-strain responses. We introduce a physically constrained diffusion model (PC3D_Diffusion) capable of managing the complexities of composite materials and producing detailed, high-quality designs. We propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to generate physically feasible microstructure designs by explicitly enforcing physical constraints during the generation process. For training purposes, 1.35 million FRPC samples were created, and their corresponding stress-strain curves were computed using established physics-based computational models. The results show that PC3D_Diffusion consistently generates high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors, while guaranteeing compliance with the physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical properties.}

In this article, we concentrate on personality traits and their effects on vulnerability to phishing attacks. We implement a rigorous systematic review following the methodology proposed by vom Brocke et al. (2009) along with the PRISMA statement. We searched five major databases (i.e., Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed), with an all-years’ time span from 1900 to January 2025. From the 1919 articles yielded in the initial search, 26 satisfied all criteria. Results reveal that extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism generally show a positive association with phishing vulnerability, whereas conscientiousness emerges as a protective factor. The review also highlights significant gaps in the current methodologies used to measure phishing vulnerability, noting a lack of standardised measurement tools to perform phishing experiments. Finally, this study underscores the need to develop secondary prevention strategies targeting at-risk groups to combat the increasingly sophisticated phishing threats.

abstract = {Background
In guiding treatment decisions for pancreatic cancer, assessing vascular invasion is critical, particularly for determining resectability. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated potential for diagnosing vascular invasion through the analysis of pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images. However, challenges arise when dealing with multicenter data sources and imbalanced datasets, which may affect the performance of deep learning models.
Method
EUS images were collected from 170 patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed at three endoscopy centers using various ultrasound systems. To diagnose vascular invasion while mitigating data variations, feature and image translation models were utilized to effectively align the source and target domains. An image translation model was utilized in the proposed approach (multicenter transfer learning (MCTL)) by employing CycleGAN and customized weighted loss classification models. The performance was compared with those of a feature translation model (multicenter domain adaptation (MCDA)) and widely accepted baseline classification models.
Result
The translation models compensated for the distinctive data-specific features and improved the models for classifying vascular invasion. Although the feature translation model proved effective, its applicability was limited across different datasets. The proposed MCTL approach showed superior classification performance with accuracy improvements of 26.79%, 67.26%, and 50.91% over the baseline model and 17.86%, 48.81%, and 42.50% over the MCDA model for the three imbalanced datasets.
Significance
This study leveraged a deep learning approach for enhancing the diagnosis of vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer using EUS images from multiple centers and addressed the issue of data imbalance.}

Drawing on Bogost's (2007) conception of procedural rhetoric and Manovich's (2013) understanding of softwarization, this article seeks to address this gap by recontextualizing writing center session notes within the layered arguments constructed by TutorTrac, a scheduling platform used by many centers. I argue this software advances a rhetoric of recordkeeping that, left unrecognized, risks shifting center practices away from stated commitments and values. In demonstrating how writing center practitioners can employ an understanding of procedural rhetoric to interrogate such applications, this study suggests more attention be dedicated to critical readings of software in writing centers.}

Five different species of Lactobacillus were isolated from the feces of PG-treated mice and L. murinus was identified to have the best anti-colitis effect, suggesting a critical role for L. murinus in mediating the therapeutic effect of PG. Furthermore, PG was degraded potentially by the beta-glucuronidase from L. murinus and adding PG to the culture medium of L. murinus remarkably increased its production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, including itaconic acid, cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and 3-amino-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-propionic acid. Additionally, L. salivarius, a human intestine-derived PG-utilizing species that is closely related to L. murinus, was also demonstrated to have potent anti-colitis effects, suggesting that it is a candidate target of PG in the human gut. Altogether, our study illustrates an unprecedented application of PG in the treatment of UC and establishes the basis for understanding its therapeutic effect from the perspective of L. murinus and its metabolites.}

To investigate the roles of star genes in fish steriodogenesis, we generated two mutation lines of star1−/− and star1−/−/star2−/− in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Previous studies revealed that deficiency of star2 gene caused delayed spermatogenesis, sperm apoptosis and sterility in male tilapia. Our present data revealed that mutation of star genes impaired male fertility. Disordered seminiferous lobules and spermatic duct obstruction were found in the testis of both types of mutants. Moreover, significant decline in semen volume, sperm abnormality and impaired fertility were also detected in star1−/− and star1−/−/star2−/− males. In star1−/− male fish, lipid accumulation, up-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes, and significant decline of androgens were found. Additionally, hyperplasic interrenal cells, elevated steroidogenic gene expression level and decline of serum glucocorticoids were detected in star1 mutants. Intriguingly, either 11-KT or cortisol supplementation successfully rescued the impaired fertility of the star1−/− mutants. Taken together, these results further indicate that Star1 might play critical roles in the production of both 11-KT and glucocorticoids, which are indispensable for the maintenance of male fertility in fish.}

Nevertheless, using RGB images to represent structural design drawings may not accurately capture the correlations and distinctions between building components, leading to shear-wall structure design inaccuracies. To address these challenges, this study proposes an optimized data representation and understanding method for the intelligent design of shear wall structures. Specifically, a component-based feature space data representation method was introduced to achieve a more accurate description of drawing features. A feature mask was also employed to precisely locate the key target areas for generating shear walls, enhancing the model's understanding of the data features. Additionally, a GAN with global and local discriminators was established to enhance the neural network's ability to generate shear wall designs at both the global image and local component levels. Finally, a training method for a GAN with dual discriminators based on feature masks is proposed. Experimental analyses and case studies showed that, compared with existing widely used GAN-based designs, the structural designs generated by the GAN trained with the proposed data representation and understanding methods demonstrated superior consistency with engineer-designed structures and outperformed structural seismic resistance.}

abstract = {With the advent of next-generation information technologies and artificial intelligence, the paradigm of product design is shifting towards a more data-driven approach. To facilitate the reuse of historical product data, designers require systematic and structured methods for data analysis and processing to enhance design efficiency. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a sophisticated statistical model adept at analyzing and forecasting sequential data patterns, is a powerful tool enabling designers to process and utilize historical product data effectively. This paper proposes a generative adaptable design method based on HMM to assist designers in rapidly generating design solutions. The proposed method utilizes HMM to model the structural modules and their connections within historical products, enabling designers to efficiently reuse existing product modules to generate diverse design configurations optimized to user requirements. Concurrently, a three-dimensional sparse matrix is used to mathematically represent the connection relations among module interfaces, facilitating the transformation of HMM-derived into design solutions with rational connections. The entropy method of product adaptability is utilized to evaluate the design solutions and identify the optimal solution. A case study of the design process for the Hybrid Additive Manufacturing device is conducted to verify the effectiveness of this method. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively assists designers in generating multiple design solutions and determining the optimal design outcome through the adaptability evaluation, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the design process.}

A total of 519 university students participated in the online questionnaire survey. The findings identified six communities, including factors related to students' behavioral intentions (e.g., attitude), objection to use chatbots for learning (e.g., AI learning anxiety), actual use (e.g., social influence); several cognitive and affective factors (e.g., perceived trust); several individual characteristics (e.g., AI literacy); and big-five personality traits. Moreover, the results demonstrated that satisfaction and intrinsic learning motivation played central roles within the network model.

Educational relevance statement
Based on the data of 519 university students, this study used network analysis to comprehensively explore 25 variables (i.e., AI-related factors, cognitive and affective factors, individual characteristics) and to identify relatively central factors influencing students' acceptance and adoption (i.e., behavioral intention, objection to use, actual use) of chatbots-assisted learning in an integrated model. These results indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and AI self-efficacy had close connections with students' behavioral intentions; privacy concern and AI learning anxiety were strongly associated with students' objection to use chatbots-based learning; social influence and facilitating conditions were highly linked with students' actual use behavior in the network model. Additionally, we found that satisfaction and intrinsic learning motivation played central roles in students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots for educational purposes. These findings offer important guidance for educators and developers to promote students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots in the learning process, thereby accelerating the widespread application of this novel technology within the educational domain.}

This study aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the blockchain’s contribution to the brand management process, integrating all relevant subthemes that previous studies have examined separately.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper adopts a qualitative approach by using constructivist grounded theory that draws on the experience of managers who work in the agrifood industry and are involved in implementing blockchain projects for Italian quality foods.
Findings
Findings allow the construction of an interpretive framework called the Blockchain Branding Model, which comprehensively interprets the interplay between blockchain and brand management. The Blockchain Branding Model comprises three levels that synthetize how blockchain intervenes in: accelerating brand enabling by providing new resources and digital assets, strengthening brand building by enriching brand identity and reinforcing brand positioning, and nurturing the brand–consumer relationship by bringing the consumer closer and tightening the bond.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first field works to explore the relationship between blockchain and branding by building a holistic model related to integrating blockchain into brand management. Results provide useful managerial implications related to strategic, operational, organizational and relational levels.}

abstract = {Cedrela fissilis is a tree species widely distributed in the tropical biomes of South America. This species has visible annual growth rings and can live for several centuries. The present study aims to (i) develop a chronology of C. fissilis to the Southern Brazilian Plateau using traditional dendrochronological methods, (ii) validate the dendrochronological dating using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb pulse method, and (iii) determine the influence of temperature and precipitation variations and their teleconnections with the tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures on the annual radial growth of this species. The ring width chronology was developed using 24 C. fissilis trees. The Schulman years of 1957, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1969 and 1974 were independently dated using the 14C bomb pulse methodology by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Tree-ring indices were compared with temperature and precipitation records from stations around the study forest. The chronology covers the period 1907–2018 (111 years) and is well replicated (> 10 trees) from 1941 onwards. Statistics commonly used in dendrochronology indicate that the chronology is highly reliable and of good quality (mean series intercorrelation r = 0.49; Rbar = 0.30; EPS = 0.86; MSI = 0.40). The 14C bomb pulse of selected calendar years showed that the trees were accurately dated using the classical cross-dating approach. Precipitation from November to December (wet period) is positively correlated with tree growth (r = 0.36, n = 49; p<0.05). In addition, variations in temperature from May to July are positively correlated with ring width (r = 0.39, n = 49; p<0.05), suggesting that C. fissilis growth is favored by abundant rainfall during the growing season and above-average winter temperatures. Interannual variation in the chronology is partially modulated by El Niño 3.4 (East Central Tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature) during Oct-Dec (r = 0.27, n = 68, p<0.05). The growth of C. fissilis trees is directly dependent on climate variability, suggesting that more abundant precipitation and higher winter temperatures, as projected for the future climate of southern Brazil, will have a positive effect on tree growth. However, prolonged droughts and high temperatures during the growing season will have a negative impact on tree growth, even in humid forests with high soil moisture content.}

The release of ChatGPT marked the beginning of a new era of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted plagiarism that disrupted traditional assessment practices. In response to this existential threat, Turnitin added an AI content detector to its platform, which is the most used plagiarism detection software in most academic institutions. However, several early studies suggest that AI detectors have questionable accuracy rates, especially when dealing with English as a second language writings or modified AI texts. To explore this uncharted territory in second language writing research, the present study evaluated the performance of Turnitin AI Detector with different text types. Using a comparative descriptive research paradigm, the researchers measured and compared Turnitin’s detection accuracy in four conditions: a) English as a foreign language texts, (b) AI-generated texts, (c) paraphrased AI-generated texts, and (d) humanized AI-generated texts. The results demonstrated that Turnitin had an above-average accuracy in detecting AI texts, but its accuracy dropped slightly for paraphrased text and significantly for humanized texts.}

A pilot study identified concrete sensory and affective descriptors linked to sustainability (e.g., natural, responsible), which were then used to determine psychoacoustic properties (e.g., pitch, consonance) capable of communicating these descriptors. Based on these properties, ten instrumental musical soundtracks were selected and evaluated for their capacity to evoke sustainability associations. The soundtracks were adapted to reflect environmental (overlaying jungle, forest, or beach sounds; Study 1) and social (overlaying talking, laughing, or cheering sounds; Study 2) dimensions. Results (combined N = 517) indicated that soundtracks aligned with sustainability descriptors reliably elicited strong perceptions of sustainability. Additionally, overlaying nature sounds enhanced associations with environmental sustainability, while incorporating human group sounds increased social sustainability associations. These findings demonstrate the potential of music and soundscapes to communicate abstract concepts, highlighting the importance of integrating musical elements with explicit sounds to evoke targeted sustainability perceptions. Harnessing such soundscapes may offer new avenues for organizations to communicate sustainability, with potential applications in brand and product experiential design.}

To address this, our pioneering study investigates the impact of two major AI tools on EFL learners from China, one involving a chatbot and the other an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 82 first-year undergraduates participated in the study and were assigned to two groups: the AI chatbot group and the ITS group. Pre- and post-session WTC questionnaires, reflection journals and a teacher interview were conducted to collect data. Results revealed significant disparities in WTC changes among the groups. Specifically, the chatbot group displayed significant improvements, while the WTC of the ITS group surprisingly declined. The study delves into the reasons behind these contrasting performances. It concludes by proposing practical implications based on the findings.}

One hundred-ninety-nine healthy individuals provided self-reports on chronic stress and medically-unexplained symptoms, resting heart rate/variability (HR/HRV; e.g., root mean square of successive differences/RMSSD, low frequency/LF power), cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal cortisol. Significant positive contributors to medically-unexplained symptoms were the chronic stress scales ‘lack of social appreciation’ and ‘chronic worries’, as well as CAR and LF HRV; diurnal cortisol was a negative contributor. Mediation analyses showed that the impact of neural indicators associated with physiological stress axis activity (HR/HRV) related to medically-unexplained symptoms, which was mediated by chronic stress, whereas the mediation effect as suggested by the positive feedback model was not significant. These cross-sectional findings do not support the positive feedback model. Longitudinal studies are required to conclude about potential mechanistic and causal relationships in the model. Nevertheless, our mediation analyses give first indication that the constitution of physiological stress axes may play a major role in how stressors are perceived and which kind of health-consequences (e.g., medically-unexplained symptoms) this may have.}

Forty-eight hams were divided into three groups: traditionally cured, overripened with 42 % weight loss at 30 °C, and overripened with 42 % weight loss at 36°. Comparing them, our results reveal significant advances in proteolysis, generating peptides with potent antioxidant and angiotensin converting enzyme-I (ACE-I) inhibitory activities. In particular, hams cured at 30 °C showed superior bioactive profiles, reaching the lowest IC50 values for ACE-I activity, while those processed at 36 °C exhibited the highest diversity, identifying 1,313 unique peptides by advanced nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In terms of antioxidant activity, overripeness significantly affected (p ≤ 0.05) antioxidant activity, with both overripened hams showing the highest antioxidant activity. These findings redefine the role of Iberian ham as a functional food with potential applications in cardiovascular and metabolic health management, while maintaining the authenticity and quality of traditional Iberian ham.}

Uncertainty at various stages of the visualization pipeline may give rise to misleading visual representations. These comprise misleading elements that may negatively impact the audiences by contributing to misinformed decisions, delayed treatments, and a lack of trust in medical information. We investigate whether visual narratives within the setting of an educational game support recognizing and addressing misleading elements in healthcare-related visualizations. Our methodological approach focuses on three key aspects: (i) identifying uncertainty types in the visualization pipeline which could serve as the origin of misleading elements, (ii) designing fictional visual narratives that comprise several misleading elements linking to these uncertainties, and (iii) proposing an interactive game that aids the communication of these misleading visualization elements to broad audiences. The game features eight fictional visual narratives built around misleading visualizations, each with specific assumptions linked to uncertainties. Players assess the correctness of these assumptions to earn points and rewards. In case of incorrect assessments, interactive explanations are provided to enhance understanding For an initial assessment of our game, we conducted a user study with 21 participants. Our study indicates that when participants incorrectly assess assumptions, they also spend more time elaborating on the reasons for their mistakes, indicating a willingness to learn more. The study also provided positive indications on game aspects such as memorability, reinforcement, and engagement, while it gave us pointers for future improvement.}

However, existing CRS approaches face two critical challenges: limited incorporation of historical user interactions and unrealistic experimental settings that fail to reflect real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose FuseRec, a novel framework that enables any Sequential Recommender System (SRS) to function as a conversational recommender through integration with an ad-hoc Planner. The integration leverages the inherent strength of SRS in processing long-term historical interactions while the Planner learns conversation strategies. Additionally, a CRS module refines recommendations by incorporating conversational context, effectively fusing sequential patterns with real-time dialogue insights. To create realistic evaluation environments, we implement an advanced GenAI-based user simulator with stratified personas reflecting varying degrees of preference awareness, from users with clear preferences to those with abstract, uncertain preferences. To handle multi-faceted user behaviors, the Planner employs four sophisticated actions: Chitchat, semantic questioning (Semantic Q), attribute questioning (Attribute Q), and Recommend, dynamically adjusting based on user response patterns. We train the Planner through reinforcement learning with curriculum strategy based on user difficulty levels. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FuseRec significantly outperforms existing approaches in recommendation accuracy while showing remarkable adaptability across different user types and recommendation scenarios.}

Cat-E compiles information on oncolytic viruses, cell lines, gene markers, and clinical studies by integrating molecular datasets from key databases such as OvirusTB, TCGA, DrugBANK, and PubChem. Users can use all datasets and upload their data to perform multiple analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, metabolic pathway exploration, metabolic flux analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, survival analysis, immune signature analysis, single nucleotide variation analysis, dynamic analysis of gene expression changes and gene regulatory network changes, and protein structure prediction. Cancer target evaluation by Cat-E is demonstrated here on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. By offering a user-friendly interface and detailed user manual, Cat-E eliminates the need for advanced computational expertise, making it accessible to experimental biologists, undergraduate and graduate students, and oncology clinicians. It serves as a valuable tool for investigating genetic variations across diverse cancer types, facilitating the identification of novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.}

abstract = {Misleading visualizations are a form of misinformation that distort data interpretation, leading to misunderstandings and poor decision-making. Despite their prevalence in both traditional and digital media, there is limited research on effective educational interventions that help students recognize and resist such deceptive visualization techniques. In this study, we developed a perceptual training intervention specifically designed to inoculate students against misleading visualizations. Unlike traditional perceptual trainings that typically involve only correct visuals, trainings for misleading visualizations require the inclusion of erroneous visual examples. While the informative feedback can help students to efficiently recognize such misleading visualizations and extract correct information, it may also disrupt the inductive learning during training, potentially reducing its overall effectiveness. To shed light into these possibilities, we investigated the role of informative feedback in a perceptual training designed for misleading visualizations. We conducted two experiments with large samples of undergraduate students (Experiment 1: N = 252, Experiment 2: N = 244). Experiment 1 tested the short-term effects of different informative feedback types during perceptual training, while Experiment 2 examined both the long-term retention (after one month) and near transfer to novel misleading visualizations. Results showed that informative feedback significantly improved students’ accuracy and efficiency in detecting misleading features within visualizations. Students also transferred these skills to novel misleading visualization types, and critically the benefits of informative feedback were sustained over a month. These results highlight the potential of perceptual trainings with informative feedback to inoculate students against misleading visualizations, offering valuable guidance for the development of educational interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of visual misinformation.}

For electroanalytical sensing applications, it is essential to achieve precise conductive patterns on the insulating surface. This work provides a novel approach to boron-doped diamond patterning using nichrome masking for selective seeding on an oxidized silicon substrate. The optimized process involves nichrome deposition, sonication, chemical etching, seeding, and tailored chemical vapor deposition of boron-doped diamond with an intrinsic layer to suppress boron diffusion. Through a systematic investigation, it was determined that isolated boron-doped diamond band electrodes can be efficiently produced on non-conductive silica. Additionally, the influence of boron doping on electrochemical performance was studied, with higher doping enhancing the electrochemical response of band electrodes. To demonstrate sensing capabilities, boron-doped diamond bands were used to detect posaconazole, an antifungal drug, exploiting its electroactive behaviour. A linear correlation between posaconazole concentration and oxidation peak current was observed over 1.43 × 10−8 – 5.71 × 10−6 M with a 1.4 × 10−8 M detection limit. The developed boron-doped diamond microbands could significantly impact the field of electroanalysis, facilitating detection of diverse biologically relevant molecules. Overall, this diamond patterning approach overcomes major challenges towards all-diamond electrochemical sensor chips.}

Research conducted on L2 written argumentation has covered myriad aspects in educational contexts which calls for the need to provide a big picture view of the types of studies conducted and their associated scholars. Accordingly, in the present study, we reviewed 108 articles on L2 argumentative writing research from 2003 to 2023 adopting a synthetic approach to investigate the impact of theoretical orientations, research methodology, and the main topics of interest. The findings revealed L2 written argumentation has gathered global interest across all educational levels. Primary topic focuses were on language usage, pedagogy, and assessment, while there was less interest in the actual quality of the argumentative content. The most frequently used theoretical frameworks were theories related to modified Toulmin models, cognition, society and culture (i.e., sociocultural theory), linguistic complexity, and genre. Research methodologies were mostly quantitative. Implications and recommendations for those working on L2 argumentative writing are discussed.}

The study began with a quantitative phytochemical analysis of SLM, followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) of methanolic leaf extracts. 180 juveniles, averaging 151.12 ± 8.54 g, were randomly assigned to four groups, each with 45 fish and three replicates in a Completely Randomized Design. The groups–Control, T1, T2, and T3 were fed diets containing 0 %, 2.5 %, 5 %, and 7.5 % SLM, respectively. Phytochemical analysis revealed substantial amounts of phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and saponins. GC–MS identified 13 distinct compounds, including fatty acids, fatty acid esters, ethers and aldehydes. Fish were weighed at the study's conclusion, and blood samples were collected for hematological and serum lipid profile analysis. Condition factors and survivability were similar across all groups (p ≥ 0.05). However, final body weight (FW), weight gain, specific growth rate, total feed intake (TFI), and feed conversion ratio varied significantly (p < 0.05). The control group exhibited the highest FW (339.20 ± 3.16 g) and TFI (597.05 ± 6.65 g), with results comparable to T1. Conversely, TFI and growth progressively declined with increasing SLM levels, with T3 showing the lowest FW (299.62 ± 7.83 g) and TFI (541.06 ± 20.39 g). Hematological and serum profile indices were similar across groups (p ≥ 0.05). These findings highlight the nutritional and ethnopharmacological relevance of A. muricata leaves. It was, therefore, concluded that SLM can be included in catfish diets at 2.5 % without negatively affecting growth or health.}

Internal branding strategies attempts to improve employee's psychological and physiological wellbeing, yet the extensive integration of technology with work and workplace activities posit serious challenges in the form of technostress. In the context of communication, digital tools and mode of work increases efficiency, yet their impact of wellbeing and technostress experienced by employees needs to be examined. The present study aims to analyze the impact of internal branding on employee wellbeing and technostress under the influence of digital internal communication. The paper also examines if digital internal communication can moderate the impact of internal branding on employee wellbeing and also the impact of employee wellbeing on technostress experienced at workplace. The mediation effect of employee wellbeing between internal branding and technostress is also analyzed. The conceptual model was built on the premises of job demands-resources theory, technology acceptance model, and transactional theory of stress and coping. Data collected from 401 employees from information technology sector was analyzed using Smart PLS4. Results of structural and measurement model using PLS SEM indicate that internal branding improves wellbeing and reduces technostress under the influence of digital internal communication. Employee wellbeing is found to mediate the impact of internal branding as well as digital internal communication on technostress. Findings support the moderating effects of digital internal communication in reducing technostress and improving employee wellbeing. The hypothesised research model integrates three theories making a novel contribution by analysing wellbeing and technostress and exploring internal branding and internal communication in the digital context.}

This paper attempts to develop a novel analytical tool called ModularGraph to represent modular building layouts (MBLs) as graphs considering their unique adjacency, connectivity, and conjoint relationships in a triumvirate. It does so by developing a prototype then applying it to 36 modular buildings for iteration, finetuning, and finalizing. It is found that ModularGraph can effectively translate heterogeneous forms of MBLs into unified graph-based representations with rich graphic and semantic information. This study not only contributes an innovative graph analytic tool for design pattern mining, but also lays a stepping stone towards generative AI for modular building design.}

U2-Net, U2-Netp, and BASENet were trained and compared by a dataset with 500 ring-type energy dissipator images. The proposed method was validated through a quasi-static tensile test and a full-scale impact test. Compared with the most accurate integration calculation method, the error of the proposed method does not exceed 3 %, and the efficiency is improved by about 25 times compared to the most commonly used manual detection method.}

The unprecedented extreme drought-heatwave event in China from March to December in 2022 provides an ideal case study. The spatiotemporal development was characterized by using meteorological drought index and drought centroid tracking, and the responses of nine water quality constituents to this event were quantified. Results revealed that the drought-heatwave was jointly driven by a significant decrease in precipitation (up to ∼50 % less than usual) and sustained high temperatures (∼2 °C above normal). Water quality deteriorated notably during this event, evidenced by ever-increased total nitrogen (TN) concentration (∼25 % to ∼30 % higher than non-drought period), higher TN extremes (27.5 mg/L), and decreased dissolved oxygen (DO) (∼−1.0 to ∼−0.5 mg/L lower than non-drought). Northern and central China particularly suffered from severe deterioration, concentrating 71 % of TN loads during the drought period, with a steeper TN load increase than in non-drought periods. Behind water quality degradation, air temperature emerged as the predominant driver of water quality deterioration, followed by streamflow and precipitation, with correlation coefficients (R) between temperature and TN/DO ranging from −0.74 to −0.59. This study revealed that extreme drought-heatwave event critically deteriorate river water quality in China, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive strategies to protect and restore water quality during extreme drought-heatwave events.}

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer potential solutions for addressing mental health care gaps, but often suffer from low engagement. Text messaging is one promising medium for increasing access and sustaining user engagement with DMHIs. This paper examines the Small Steps SMS program, an 8-week, automated, adaptive text message-based intervention for depression and anxiety.
Methods
We conducted an 8-week longitudinal usability test of the Small Steps SMS program, recruiting 20 participants who met criteria for major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. Participants used the automated intervention for 8 weeks and completed symptom severity and usability self-report surveys after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention use. Participants also completed individual interviews to provide feedback on the intervention.
Results
Participants responded to automated messages on 70 % of study days and with 85 % of participants sending responses to messages in the 8th week of use. Usability surpassed established cutoffs for software that is considered acceptable. Depression symptom severity decreased significantly over the usability test, but reductions in anxiety symptoms were not significant. Participants noted key areas for improvement including addressing message volume, aligning message scheduling to individuals' availability, and increasing the customizability of content.
Limitations
This study does not contain a control group.
Conclusions
An 8-week automated interactive text messaging intervention, Small Steps SMS, demonstrates promise with regard to being a feasible, usable, and engaging method to deliver daily mental health support to individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression.}

Astrotourism was identified as a potentially suitable income-generating activity. Various astrotourism initiatives are operational globally. However, their applicability within the South African context is unknown. The research evaluated successful global astrotourism initiatives to determine how these examples can be applicable to SANParks. Sixty-two global astrotourism initiatives were evaluated and 42 in-depth stakeholder interviews were conducted. Thematical data analysis was followed by a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis. The research makes a meaningful contribution by highlighting important concepts for consideration in support of viable astrotourism development in SANParks. Elements requiring consideration to provide tourists with quality experiences include appropriate locations for astrotourism activities, mitigation of light pollution, climate, seasonality, need for community engagement, well-trained presenters, carefully planned programmes and development of suitable management policies to protect dark skies, allowing for variation within each park's unique situation.}

Given that conventional opioids (MOR agonists) are widely recognized for their toxicological impacts on the reproductive system and embryonic development, we evaluated the effects of HSK21542 accordingly. The results showed that HSK21542 did not influence male and female fertility or early embryonic development in rats. HSK21542 also did not show significant manifestations of pre- and post-natal development toxicity in rats. In the embryo-fetal developmental study, even though there was a 3.5 % increase in incidence of fetuses with incomplete ossification of thoracic vertebral centrum in the 4 mg/kg/day group, the plasma exposure of HSK21542 in rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 82.3 times higher than that of human exposure at 1 μg/kg. On the other hand, exposure to HSK21542 during pregnancy in rabbits did not show any teratogenic risk, only causing a minor impact on bone ossification in fetuses. In conclusion, HSK21542 has a favorable safety profile with only minor effects on the embryo-fetal developmental outcomes.}

abstract = {Products and services labeled as AI-created are perceived differently than identical ones attributed to humans, reflecting the phenomenon of algorithm aversion. This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by AI algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by AI, humans, or human-AI collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.}

As the key advantage of the double-double composites is the reduced repeat number of sub-laminates necessary to achieve homogeneity, it is therefore crucial to determine the best pattern of sub-laminates which ensures the optimal lightweight design with the minimum thickness. In the data-driven framework, first, a generative neural network model was built for generating the sub-laminates fitting in the scope of the homogeneous criterion. Then, a symbolic regression model was built for quantitatively finding the hidden layup patterns in the dataset of these sub-laminates. It is found that the form of double-double and triple-double stands out in the vast design space of all the possible layup sequences. The 4-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/β/−θ] and 6-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/−γ/+γ/+β/−θ] are most recommended as they meet the homogeneous criterion with less thickness and offer larger design space of mechanical properties. The established data-driven framework can be extended to other scenarios especially in finding the common design rules of laminates.}

This paper proposes a multi-scale defect detection method for gear tooth flanks, expanding the minimum detectable scale of surface defects to below 0.1 mm. Considering the imaging characteristics of involute tooth flanks, a multi-light enhanced image acquisition system is established. We constructed a tooth flank dataset containing 7,038 defect instances, introducing a unified sliding window and global non-maximum suppression approach to effectively address the bottleneck in detecting minor- and medium-scale defects while avoiding redundant detections. A high-quality tooth flank defect generation model is developed based on DDPM-ASTU-Net, which synthesizes defect samples according to the dataset characteristics to augment the training set, effectively mitigating the issue of imbalanced data distribution. We propose a DUD-YOLO detection network to target the typical defect distribution patterns in remanufacturing tooth flank surfaces. A lightweight dynamic feature fusion component is designed to enhance high-dimensional key feature extraction. A mixed local channel attention mechanism is merged to preserve crucial inter-channel correlation information while reducing computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Multiple convolutional optimizations significantly decrease the model parameters and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Compared to the baseline detection network, DUD-YOLO achieves simultaneous improvements of 5.4 %, 6.5 %, 8.3 %, and 7.2 % in precision, parameters, FLOPs, and inference speed, respectively. The proposed method provides an efficient and precise solution for gear remanufacturability assessment.}

In addition, digital forensic analysis of the Android-based IVI systems is not supported by the popular forensic tool, Berla's iVe. To address this, we first acquire multiple types of logs from three Jellybean-based systems (2017-2019) and two KitKat-based IVI systems (2022-2023) using a practical and non-invasive method, and then perform a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the logging mechanisms in the IVI systems. We then examine volatile and nonvolatile log data acquired from the IVI systems from the perspective of vehicle forensics. Jellybean-based systems maintain seven ring buffers for volatile logs, while KitKat-based systems use five. Volatile logs are erased when the system is powered off. Both versions of the Android systems store nonvolatile log files of seven different types, with data retained for up to a year. We conducted a thorough analysis of the acquired logs, uncovering artifacts related to navigation use, radio listening, engine start/stop, door access, seat belt use, and Bluetooth connections, including phone calls and SMS messages. In addition, we compare the artifacts identified within those IVI systems. Finally, our analysis creates a timeline to track driver behavior, and provides critical insights into driver actions and vehicle events.}

In addition, do different types of EPUs impact exchange-rate risk spillovers consistently, and at which frequencies are they the most significant? To answer this puzzle, categorical EPUs, namely fiscal policy uncertainty (FPU), monetary policy uncertainty (MPU), trade policy uncertainty (TPU), and exchange rate and capital account policy uncertainty (ECPU), are introduced to explore the role that each type of EPU plays in the RMB exchange rate extreme risk spillovers. Moreover, our investigation is also conducted in multiple time-frequency domains through the implementation of the wavelet transform approach. The results indicate that the MPU exerts the most significant impact on total spillovers, while the TPU exhibits the weakest impact. For the net spillovers of each RMB exchange rate, the HKD/CNY and the AUD/CNY are more sensitive to EPUs, particularly in the long-term time horizon. These findings provide potential implications for policymakers in terms of market stabilization and for investors with foreign currency assets.}

The quantitative analysis found that Lim, W.M. is the eminent author; Quality Assurance in Education is the most popular journal; and the United States and the United Kingdom are the major contributing countries to this field. The evolving criteria for quality assessment in the rapidly emerging virtual and distance learning can be centred around five major themes: technological infrastructure, ICT competency, and adaptability, pedagogy for online education, collaboration, partnership, and motivation, as well as a blended learning environment. Thus, this study contributes to the existing theory by mapping the gaps and highlighting emerging themes for assessing education quality. This paper also supplies evidence to the educationists and policy-makers that help them formulate time-bound policy and to the researchers suggesting the need to develop valid and reliable measurement indicators for the evolving quality assessment criteria in the post-COVID era. This review has also proposed the future research agenda on applying generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) like ChatGPT, ChatSonic, Jasper Chat, and metaverse (Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook) technologies in secondary education for quality enhancement.}

This research dissects the application of GEO concrete as a high-temperature TES material, primarily focusing on its optimization and scalability. The introductory part of the study involves the development and validation of a three-dimensional numerical model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The model demonstrated an average accuracy rate of 5 %, as justified by empirical data. Later, a two-tiered investigation to determine the optimal design for GEO concrete TES systems was investigated. Three different geometries plus the impact of crucial parameters such as air velocity, tube diameter, and module size on the thermal storage capacity (Q) studied. It further extends into a parametric examination, exploring a variety of tube sizes, arrangements, and configurations. It is found that air velocity primarily influences Q. A subsequent phase provides an analysis of the thermodynamic effects brought by the inclusion of tubes within TES modules through an equivalent parametric study. It exposes the thermal resistance resulting from tube insertion. The study reinforces the superior thermal performance of tubeless GEO concrete TES configurations, as signified by overall heat transfer rate (Q̇). The study also signals the significant roles of key parameters in determining the temperature (T) and Q within TES unit using Pearson's correlation coefficient equation. As a final observation, this work emphasizes the sustained significance of on-site evaluations to consistently monitor the interplay between TES materials and high-temperature fluids (HTFs) over extended periods for viability analysis purposes.}

The integration of digital twins and graph neural networks is emphasized as a frontier to reveal coupled heat-mass transfer, chemical reactions, and mechanical interactions underlying quality evolution. While progress has been made in improving efficiency and quality, persistent challenges remain in model generalization across diverse food types and drying conditions, computational complexity, and mechanistic interpretability. Future research should develop physics-data hybrid frameworks and multi-scale integration, driving the transition toward model-data dual-driven intelligent drying.}

The paper derives an analytical slender condition to process the printing regions with low curvature while establishing deposition direction allocation methods to account for the trajectory regions with high curvature. Real-time thermal image localization is performed with key printing feature detection and calibration. The localized and calibrated thermal images are aligned with the defined deposition direction to acquire the deposition inaccuracies.

abstract = {Introduction
Acute rejection (AR) undermines the life-extending benefits of kidney transplantation and is diagnosed using the invasive biopsy procedure. T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), or concurrent TCMR + ABMR (Mixed Rejection [MR]) are the three major types of AR. Development of noninvasive biomarkers diagnostic of AR due to any of the three types is a useful addition to the diagnostic armamentarium.
Methods
We developed customized RT-qPCR assays and measured urinary cell mRNA copy numbers in 145 biopsy-matched urine samples from 126 kidney allograft recipients. We determined whether the urinary cell three-gene signature diagnostic of TCMR (Suthanthiran et al., 2013) discriminates patients with no rejection biopsies (NR, n = 50) from those with ABMR (n = 28) or MR (n = 20) biopsies.
Results
The urinary cell three-gene signature discriminated all three types of rejection biopsies from NR biopsies (P < 0.0001, One-way ANOVA). Dunnett's multiple comparisons test yielded P < 0.0001 for NR vs. TCMR; P < 0.001 for NR vs. ABMR; and P < 0.0001 for NR vs. MR. By bootstrap resampling, optimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.749 (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.638 to 0.840) for NR vs. TCMR (P < 0.0001); 0.780 (95% CI, 0.656 to 0.878) for NR vs. ABMR (P < 0.0001); and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.727 to 0.947) for NR vs. MR (P < 0.0001). All three rejection categories were distinguished from NR biopsies with similar accuracy (all AUC comparisons P > 0.05).
Conclusion
The urinary cell three-gene signature score discriminates AR due to TCMR, ABMR or MR from NR biopsies in human kidney allograft recipients.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data refer to information systematically reported by patients, or on behalf of patients, without the influence of health care professionals. It is a focal point of the health care system’s ambition toward becoming more involving and personalized. It is recognized that PROs provide valuable data. However, despite this recognition, there are challenges related to both patients’ and clinicians’ accurate interpretations of the quantitative data. To overcome these challenges, this study explores text vignettes as a representation of PROs.
Objective
This study aimed to develop data-informed text vignettes based on data from the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument as another way of representing PRO data and to examine how these are perceived as understandable and relevant for both patients and clinicians.
Methods
The text vignettes were created from participant responses to the READHY instrument, which encompasses health literacy, health education, and eHealth literacy. The text vignettes were created from 13 individual text strings, each corresponding to a scale in the READHY instrument. This study consisted of 3 sequential parts. In part 1, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed the READHY instrument, providing data to be used to create vignettes based on cluster profiles from the READHY instrument. Part 2 focused on the development of scale-based strings representing all READHY dimensions, which were evaluated through iterative cognitive interviews. In part 3, clinicians and patients assessed the understanding and relevance of the text vignettes.
Results
Clinicians and patients both understood and related to the text vignettes. Patients viewed the text vignettes as an accurate reflection of their PRO responses, and clinicians perceived the text vignettes as aligned with their understanding of patients’ experiences.
Conclusions
Text vignettes can be developed using PRO instruments, with individual scales as input strings. This provides an opportunity to present numeric values in a text format that is understandable and recognizable to most patients and clinicians. Challenges with the vignette’s language and layout require customization and clinician training to ensure meaningful interpretation. Findings also support the need to expand the study and enhance clinical relevance with alternative or contextually relevant text vignettes.}

However, to effectively evaluate and validate these advancements, standardized testing methods are essential, extending beyond single-cell analysis to encompass stack-level characterization. This paper proposes comprehensive characterization methods tailored for analysis of electrolysis stacks and their performance characteristics. Each method is introduced with a focus on its practical applicability, accompanied by detailed procedural guidelines for implementation. Furthermore, variations within each method are discussed, offering possibilities for gathering additional insights. Presenting a portfolio of different methods, ranging from standard to advanced techniques applicable at the stack level, the paper showcases results obtained through their application. These results, normalized to cell area, demonstrate the significance of each method in obtaining stack characteristics crucial for informed design decisions on material selection and subsequent integration into electrolysis systems. By illustrating results derived from various stacks, this study contributes valuable insights for evaluating design, material suitability, and operational performance, thereby advancing the development and deployment of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis technology for sustainable hydrogen production.}

Here, we explored the use of ML in the drug development process, offering a detailed overview of its classifications, methodologies, applications, and related problems. The classifications of ML namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning (DL) are examined comprehensively, emphasizing their distinct functions and capabilities across various phases of drug development. Techniques including support vector machines (SVM), Naïve bayes (NB), Bayesian networks (BN), random forests (RF), multilayer perceptrons (MLP), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are evaluated for their effectiveness in identifying prospective drug candidates, forecasting pharmacokinetics (PK), and enhancing therapeutic profiles. Essential elements of effective ML deployment, encompassing comprehensive data collection methodologies, sophisticated data analytics, and access to huge databases like PubChem, ChEMBL, and DrugBank, are also discussed. The challenges associated with data quality, model interpretability, and computing resource constraints are examined, and various solutions, including transfer learning, data augmentation, and the establishment of collaborative frameworks, are proposed. Moreover, the chapter concludes by highlighting the necessity for improved data integration, the standardization of diverse datasets, and multidisciplinary collaboration among academia, industry, and artificial intelligence (AI) experts. By concentrating on these domains, the future of ML in drug discovery is set to unveil unparalleled prospects for the creation of safer, swifter, and more efficacious treatments. This chapter also provides an exhaustive overview for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders, elucidating the present status of ML in drug discovery and facilitating its future progress.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this article is to discover how false information has been received through mobile instant messaging services (MIMS), Facebook and Twitter and what sociodemographic factors have a stronger influence on the perception of the democratic effects generated by the disinformation on the citizens of three countries.
Design/methodology/approach
To do this, an online survey (n = 3,019) was developed for citizens of Spain (n = 1,015), Germany (n = 1,001) and the UK (n = 1,003). The sample is stratified according to the gender, age, income and ideology of the respondents.
Findings
The results show that the reception of false information is high in all three countries, especially on Facebook. Additionally, we found that the country of origin, genre, age and ideology influence the reception of disinformation in MIMS, but not in the rest of the platforms. Considering disinformation's effects on citizens, we observe how, in general terms, those surveyed perceive disinformation effects with a medium-low intensity. In this way, citizens do not believe that false information causes substantial changes in their thinking. An increase in mistrust has been detected toward social media and mainstream media, which are not considered reliable sources of information. At this point, the respondents' country of origin, income and ideology are conditioning factors.
Originality/value
This research provides some relevant trends that help to better understand how disinformation is received on digital platforms in three countries with different political and social traditions, as well as the effects that it has had on citizens and the sociodemographic and political factors that have a greater incidence.}
