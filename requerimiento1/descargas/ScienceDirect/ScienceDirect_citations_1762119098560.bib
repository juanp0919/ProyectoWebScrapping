abstract = {Summary
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, with approximately 5 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019. Tackling AMR requires a multifaceted and cohesive approach that ranges from increased understanding of mechanisms and drivers at the individual and population levels, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, improved infection prevention and control measures, and strengthened global policies and funding to development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic strategies. In this rapidly advancing field, this Review provides a concise update on AMR, encompassing epidemiology, evolution, underlying mechanisms (primarily those related to last-line or newer generation of antibiotics), infection prevention and control measures, access to antibiotics, antimicrobial stewardship, AMR surveillance, and emerging non-antibiotic therapeutic approaches. The Review also discusses the potential roles of artificial intelligence in addressing AMR, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, AMR surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, diagnosis, and antimicrobial drug discovery and development. This Review highlights the urgent need for addressing the global effects of AMR and for rapid advancement of relevant technology in this dynamic field.}

abstract = {Many online collaborative projects such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap organize collaboration among their contributors sequentially. When engaging in sequential collaboration, one contributor creates an initial entry which is then consecutively adjusted or maintained by the following contributors. Thereby, only the latest version of this entry is presented to subsequent contributors. Sequential collaboration was recently examined as a method for aggregating numerical judgments compared to averaging independently provided judgments (i.e., wisdom of crowds). Sequential collaboration was shown to yield increasingly accurate judgments that result in estimates that are at least as accurate as those obtained from aggregating independent judgments. However, sequential collaboration differs from simply aggregating independent judgments in the sequential nature of the process of providing judgments and in the possibility of contributors to opt out of providing a judgment by maintaining it. How these different features contribute to the accuracy of provided judgments is still unknown. In two experiments, we found that the most accurate judgments were provided by participants who engaged in standard sequential collaboration (with an opt-out option), whereas participants who performed sequential collaboration without opt-out gave less accurate judgments; and independent judgments were least accurate. Thus, both the sequential-collaboration process per se as well as the possibility to opt out and not provide a judgment contribute to the accuracy of contributions. These two features come together in a typical sequential-collaboration paradigm. Allowing contributors to use sequential collaboration in collaborative online projects or at least implement some features of sequential collaboration can be beneficial for the resulting entries and information.}

abstract = {Objectives
To explore the ability of artificial intelligence to produce comparison tables to facilitate shared decision-making.
Methods
An expert human-generated comparison table (Option Grid ™) was compared to four comparison tables produced by large language models and one produced using a Google search process that a patient might undertake. Each table was prepared for a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee, considering a knee replacement. The results were compared to the Option Grid.™ The information items in each comparison table were divided into eight categories: the intervention process; benefits; side effects & adverse effects; pre-operative care; post-operative care & physical recovery; repeat surgery; decision-making process; and alternative interventions. We assessed the accuracy of each information item in a binary manner (accurate, inaccurate).
Results
OpenBioLLM-70b and two proprietary ChatGPT models generated similar frequencies of information items across most categories, but omitted information on alternative interventions. The Google search process yielded the highest number of information items (n = 41), and OpenBioLLM-8b yielded the lowest (n = 20). Accuracy, compared to the human Option Grid, was 97 % for the ChatGPT models and the open-source OpenBioLLM-70b, and 95 % for OpenBioLLM-8b and the Google search process. The human-generated Option Grid had superior readability.
Conclusions
Large language models produced comparison tables that are 3–5 % less accurate than a human generated Option Grid. Comparison tables produced by large language models may be less readable and require additional checking and editing.
Practice implications
Subject to fact-checking and feedback, large language models may have a role to play in scaling up the production of evidence-based comparison tables that could assist patients and others.}

abstract = {In optimizing the performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is crucial. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in predicting battery states. However, the effectiveness of these data-driven approaches largely depends on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data primarily through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it extremely difficult to obtain high-quality data. This difficulty, combined with data incompleteness, significantly affects prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this study introduces End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as supervised conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, the RCVAE generates the required charging data in real time based on the battery’s ECL and EOL. This avoids storing irrelevant information, saving space and resources. RCVAE uses a lightweight architecture, enabling fast generation of necessary voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity data. This approach provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.}

abstract = {Background
ChatGPT is a natural language processing chatbot with a significant prevalence in modern media with a clear application in the medical triage workflow. ChatGPT has shown significant capacity for understanding clinical vignettes, radiology reports, and even passing the American Board of Neurological Surgery board examination. There has never been an evaluation of the chatbot in triage and diagnosing spinal vignettes common to primary and urgent care practice.
Methods
Fifteen clinical scenarios were created to mimic spinal complaints common to primary and urgent care scenarios. GPT-4 was instructed to assess the situation as if it was in a primary care office and determine diagnosis, imaging recommendations, and if emergency room (ER) or operative referral was necessary. Answers were recorded and the results compared to those of attending and resident respondents.
Results
GPT-4 provided the most likely diagnosis in each scenario. Additionally, it recommended reasonable clinical management of each scenario which would fall within standard practice guidelines. ChatGPT tended toward over-referral to the ER; however, this was not significant. GPT-4 was noninferior in all categories when compared to respondents.
Conclusions
ChatGPT is a powerful tool for primary triage of spinal issues. It can rapidly and accurately evaluate clinical scenarios and provide clear diagnostic reasoning. GPT-4 is not designed for medical use and will provide a disclaimer as such. It did tend toward over-referring patients to the ER. With specific training, it is likely that artificial intelligence and natural language processing chatbots will become widely used in primary triage of spinal issues.}

However, its potential benefits come with compelling ethical and legal risks, necessitating proper guardrails steering AI in beneficial directions. Amid the global race to AI regulation, China has exhibited strong and open ambition in shaping the emerging global AI order. In response to challenges posed by AI, China has not only implemented agile administrative intervention in policy support, central coordination, and investment, but also adopted an AI governance framework that characterized by ‘complexity,’ ‘agility,’ ‘stability,’ and ‘flexibility.’ Nevertheless, while an agile, sector-specific approach to AI governance may yield short-term benefits, it raises long-term concerns, including opaque decision-making, weak enforcement, fragmented oversight, and inadequate protection of fundamental rights. In particular, governance fragmentation marked by overlapping regulatory bodies and layered rulemaking risks producing piecemeal and outdated regulations that struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. Current interventions often prioritize systemic stability over ethical clarity and robust supervision, while strategic ambiguity further complicates the implementation of AI ethics and hinders effective oversight, whether internal or administrative. Instead of calling for an omnibus AI law that applies a uniform package of rules, Chinese regulators chose to adapt horizontal elements into vertical regulations through a set of bureaucratic know-how and iterative regulatory tools. Through a comparative legal analysis, this paper finds that comprehending the intricacies of China’s AI regulatory approach is vital not only for projecting its future technological progression but also for understanding its impact on international tech competition. Differences in diverse AI governance may offer valuable insights while commonalities in AI governance values and principles hold promises for global cooperation in responsible AI governance. Moreover, it is plausible to expect that China will reconcile existing horizontal regulatory tools in a horizontal legislative package, while the EU AI Act provides valuable practical implications for the transition from vertical AI-related regulations to a horizontal Chinese AI Law, and the decentralized regulatory approach adopted by the U.S. serves as a useful reference for multi-stakeholder and multi-level cooperation. In addition, EU’s rights-driven framework and US’s market-driven model may serve as critical benchmarks, influencing China’s state-driven approach to harmonizing its legislative strategies for a responsive AI regulation.}

abstract = {Introduction
Simulation based education (SBE) and creatively designed placements are becoming increasingly well established in radiography pedagogy and allow a more efficient use of clinical resources in the training of new radiographers to meet workforce demands. Student radiographers have expressed concern about striking a balance between providing patient centered care and developing their radiographic competency. A co-designed simulated placement was developed with a focus on these two aspects of radiography education aiming to increase the competence and confidence of level 4 students while incorporating patient centred care (PCC) into their practice.
Methods
A multidisciplinary approach was used to develop a nine-day simulation where activities were scaffolded to help student radiographers to learn, develop and revisit critical skills. The students completed a reflective journal during this placement, the contents of which were thematically analysed.
Results
Students reported a statistically significant improvement in perceived confidence levels related to both radiographic and broad-based skills after simulation sessions. Several additional themes emerged from the reflective data related to communication skills, preparation for practice, perceptions of simulation and an empowered identity as a student radiographer. The students’ reflective diaries also explored students’ perceptions of their roles in the promotion patient centred care and they reported that the addition of realistic stressors inspired by the clinical environment, allowed them to practice dealing with these situations in a safe space.
Conclusion
: SBE effects students’ perceptions of their competence and confidence in the clinical environment. By providing a safe space, SBE empowers students to respond to some stressors that might be encountered in clinical practice. A carefully scaffolded, multidisciplinary approach to simulated placement is good for confidence and competence building.
Implications for practice
The multi-professional dynamic partnership enabled effective collaboration to deliver a positively evaluated simulation package. Students were motivated to deliver enhanced PCC and had a strong desire to drive change, to guarantee patient safety and high-quality care.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cutaneous traction is used to temporize lower extremity fractures and relies on friction between the skin and surrounding material to apply a longitudinal force. This circumferential compressive force can lead to pressure sores, skin sloughing, or compressive neuropathies. These complications have been reported in up to 11% of patients when the cutaneous traction relies on adhesive tapes, plaster, and rubber bandages being in immediate contact with the skin. The rates of these complications are not well documented when using modern foam boots.
Methods
A retrospective chart review was performed on all orthopedic trauma patients who suffered pelvic or lower extremity injuries between March 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2021 at a single Level-1 trauma center. We included all patients with femoral fractures, axially unstable pelvic ring and/or acetabular fractures, and unstable hip dislocations temporized with the use of cutaneous traction. All patients had intact skin and lower extremity nerve function prior to application.
Results
There were 138 patients identified with 141 lower extremities. The average patient age was 50.7 (6–100) years. Mean traction weight of 9.8 (5–20) pounds. Average traction duration was 20.9 (2.3–243.5) hours. At the time of traction removal, there was 1 (0.7%) new skin wound and 0 nerve palsies. The new skin wound was a stage one heel pressure sore and did not require further treatment.
Conclusion
Cutaneous traction with a modern foam boot was found to have a skin complication rate of 0.7% and a nerve palsy complication rate of 0% for an overall complication rate of 0.7%, which has not been previously established and is lower than historically reported complication rates of 11% when utilizing adhesive and plaster directly on skin.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Epidemiological studies report associations between antibiotics given during pregnancy, childbirth, and infancy and subsequent risk for childhood infections. The specific role of intrapartum and neonatal antibiotic exposures is not well-described.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of healthy term infants through 6 years of age. The primary exposure was perinatal antibiotics, defined as intravenous intrapartum antibiotic administration during the admission for childbirth or administered to the infant ≤3 days after birth. The primary outcome was infection-related inpatient encounters. Adjusted multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards and marginal means/rates models were used to investigate the association between exposure and outcome. A secondary analysis examined the association between early infant antibiotics administered during the first three months after birth, including perinatal antibiotics, and the outcome.
Findings
Of 13,919 infants, 3936 (28%) had perinatal antibiotic exposure. 1294 (9.3%) children had 1619 inpatient encounters, of which 988 (61%) were infection-related. Infection-related inpatient encounters occurred in 265 (6.7%) children exposed to perinatal antibiotics, compared to 584 (5.8%) unexposed children (risk difference 1.2%, 95% CI 0.3–2.1%, p = 0.005). In multivariable-adjusted models, perinatal antibiotic exposure was not associated with infection-related inpatient encounters [Cox model: aHR 1.16, 95% CI 0.95, 1.51, p = 0.15; marginal rates/means model: aHR 1.22, 95% CI 0.98, 1.51, p = 0.08]. Early infant antibiotics were also not associated with the outcome.
Interpretation

abstract = {Objectives
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common adverse effect among breast cancer patients, significantly affecting quality of life. Existing evidence on the prevention, assessment, and management of this condition is fragmented and inconsistent. This study constructed a CINV knowledge graph using a large language model (LLM) to integrate nursing and medical evidence, thereby supporting systematic clinical decision-making.
Methods
A top-down approach was adopted. 1) Knowledge base preparation: Nine databases and eight guideline repositories were searched up to October 2024 to include guidelines, evidence summaries, expert consensuses, and systematic reviews screened by two researchers. 2) Schema design: Referring to UMLS, SNOMED CT, and the Nursing Intervention Classification, entity and relation types were defined to build the ontology schema. 3) LLM-based extraction and integration: Using the Qwen model under the CRISPE framework, named entity recognition, relation extraction, disambiguation, and fusion were conducted to generate triples and visualize them in Neo4j. Four expert rounds ensured semantic and logical consistency. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and 95% confidence intervals in Python 3.11.
Result
A total of 47 studies were included (18 guidelines, two expert consensuses, two evidence summaries, and 25 systematic reviews). The Qwen model extracted 273 entities and 289 relations; after expert validation, 238 entities and 242 relations were retained, forming 244 triples. The ontology comprised nine entity types and eight relation types. The F1-scores for named entity recognition and relation extraction were 82.9 (95% CI: 0.820–0.839) and 85.54 (95% CI: 0.844–0.867), respectively. The average node degree was 2.03, with no isolated nodes.
Conclusion
The LLM-based CINV knowledge graph achieved structured integration of nursing and medical evidence, offering a novel, data-driven tool to support clinical nursing decision-making and advance intelligent healthcare.}

abstract = {Objectives
To examine the optimal range of steps for an individual based on the dose-response relationship of the number of steps taken with disability incidence and all-cause mortality stratified by age and physical frailty.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
Setting and Participants
8664 community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
The daily number of steps was measured using an accelerometer. Disability incidence and mortality were prospectively determined over 60 months. Participants were stratified using a nonlinear restricted cubic spline based on age ≥75 or <75 years and physical frailty, per the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria.
Results
The study cohort's median age was 74 years [interquartile range (IQR) range 71-78), and 54.0% were female. Incidental disability and death were observed in 1373 (15.8%) and 529 (6.1%) participants, respectively. The median steps per day were 5514 (IQR 3878-7616). Daily steps were nonlinearly associated with disability incidence and mortality. The optimal cutoff points for frail and nonfrail participants were, respectvely, 2168 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98] and 7459 (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.99) steps for disability incidence and 2593 (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.98) and 3282 (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98) steps for all-cause mortality. The optimal cutoff points for participants >75 and <75 years were, respectively, 6066 (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) and 8573 (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99) steps for disability incidence and 1824 (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98) and 4128 (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.99) steps for all-cause mortality.
Conclusions and Implications
Participants ≥75 years and frail participants required lower daily steps for preventing disability incidence and all-cause mortality than those <75 years and nonfrail participants, indicating that lower targets may still provide health-promoting benefits. Thus, the optimal step number should be considered based on individual characteristics, including age and frailty.}

abstract = {Background
Gait speed indicates the onset or decline of physical performance in sarcopenia. However, real-time measurements of other gait parameters, such as step length, stride length, step width, and support time, are limited. The advent of wearable technology has facilitated the measurement of these parameters, necessitating further investigation into their potential applications.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between gait parameters measured using wearable sensors and muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in community-dwelling older adults.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study of 91 participants aged ≥65 years, gait parameters, such as step count, step length, cadence, single and double support times, vertical oscillation, and instantaneous vertical loading rate (IVLR), measured using a wireless earbud device, were analyzed on the basis of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), calf circumference, handgrip strength, 5-time chair stand test, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and the SARC-F (strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs and fall frequency) questionnaire. This study was conducted from July 10 to November 1, 2023, at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Seoul, Korea. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate independent associations after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities.
Results
Among 91 participants (45 men and 46 women; mean age 74.1 years for men and 73.6 years for women), gait speed and vertical oscillation showed negative associations with their performance in the 5-time chair stand test (P<.001) and SARC-F and positive associations with their performance in the SPPB (P<.001). Vertical oscillations were also associated with grip strength (P=.003). Single and double support times were associated with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001). In addition, double support time was associated with SARC-F scores (P<.001). Gait speed, support time, vertical oscillation, and IVLR showed independent associations with performance in the 5-time chair stand test and SPPB (P<.001), both related to muscle strength or physical performance. Gait speed, double support time, and vertical oscillation all had significant associations with SARC-F scores.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated a significant association between gait monitoring using wearable sensors and quantitative assessments of muscle strength and physical performance in older people. Furthermore, this study substantiated the extensive applicability of diverse gait parameters in predicting sarcopenia.}

The 21st Century Cures Act final rule requires that patients have real-time access to their radiology reports, which contain technical language. The objective of this study to was to use a novel system called RadGPT, which integrates concept extraction and a large language model (LLM), to help patients understand their radiology reports.
Methods
RadGPT generated 150 concept explanations and 390 question-and-answer pairs from 30 radiology report impressions from between 2012 and 2020. The extracted concepts were used to create concept-based explanations, as well as concept-based question-and-answer pairs for which questions were generated using either a fixed template or an LLM. Additionally, report-based question-and-answer pairs were generated directly from the impression using an LLM without concept extraction. One board-certified radiologist and four radiology residents rated the material quality using a standardized rubric.
Results
Concept-based LLM-generated questions were of significantly higher quality than concept-based template-generated questions (P < .001). Excluding those template-based question-and-answer pairs from further analysis, nearly all (>95%) of RadGPT-generated materials were rated highly, with at least 50% receiving the highest possible ranking from all five raters. No answers or explanations were rated as likely to affect the safety or effectiveness of patient care. Report-level LLM-based questions and answers were rated particularly highly, with 92% of report-level LLM-based questions and 61% of the corresponding report-level answers receiving the highest rating from all raters.
Conclusions
The educational tool RadGPT generated high-quality explanations and question-and-answer pairs that were personalized for each radiology report, unlikely to produce harmful explanations, and likely to enhance patient understanding of radiology information.}

abstract = {Background
Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
Objective
This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance.
Methods
The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals.
Results
We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information.
Conclusions
The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.}

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying “warning labels” to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation.}

Oligo(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) resins are commonly used owing to their low dielectric constant and high thermal resistance; however, further reduction in dielectric loss tangents is needed for future communication networks. Materials with excellent dielectric properties typically exhibit low polarity and high flammability, presenting a trade-off between dielectric performance and flame retardancy. PMPS-V exhibits thermosetting behavior and an extremely low dielectric-loss tangent (<0.001 at 10 GHz). Owing to its polyphenylene sulfide backbone, PMPS-V meets the UL-94 V-0 flame retardancy standard. Long-term heat resistance testing at 150 °C confirmed minimal degradation in dielectric properties, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. In addition, PMPS-V has a high glass transition temperature and favorable solubility in common solvents such as toluene, making it suitable for printed wiring board applications. These results indicate that PMPS-V is a promising candidate for next-generation low dielectric materials.}

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory condition characterised by the formation of granuloma in organs. It can cause end-organ damage and is associated with an elevated risk of mortality [1, 2]. Despite its clinical importance, the epidemiology of sarcoidosis in England is poorly characterised, with a notable lack of published data on its prevalence, and estimates of incidence and mortality that were last calculated two decades ago [3, 4].
Objectives:
This study's objective was to explore contemporary trends in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of sarcoidosis in England.
Methods:
This research utilised a population-based approach, using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linking primary care records with secondary care data and death registrations from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Adults aged 18 years or older who contributed data between 2003 and 2023 were included. Sarcoidosis cases were identified through diagnostic codes in primary care records. Age- and sex-standardised incidence and prevalence were calculated. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to compare mortality rates with those of the general population. A control cohort without sarcoidosis was matched within the CPRD, and negative binomial regression was applied to assess differences in all-cause mortality rates between individuals with incident sarcoidosis and their matched counterparts.
Results:
A total of 56,287 patients had a diagnostic code for sarcoidosis between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st 2023. The age and sex-standardised incidence of sarcoidosis was 6.65 per 100,000 person-years in 2003 and 7.73 per 100,000 person-years in 2023 (Figure 1a). Regression demonstrated an annual increase in incidence of 0.10 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) over the study period. Notable rises in new diagnoses were observed among males and individuals over 60 years old. The prevalence of sarcoidosis using at least one diagnostic code, standardised by age and sex, increased from 168 per 100,000 in 2003 to 231 per 100,000 in 2023. This increase appeared consistent across the study period (Figure 1b). The age-and-sex-standardised all-cause mortality rate among the prevalent population was 9.5 per 1,000 patients in 2003 and 12.2 per 1,000 patients in 2023 (Figure 1c). Over the study period, there was an annual increase in mortality of 0.07 per 1,000 patients (95% CI 0.02 to 0.12). Elevated mortality rates were observed in males [SMR: 1.8 (95% CI: 1.7 to 1.8)] and females [SMR: 2.0 (95% CI: 2.0 to 2.1)], particularly among those aged 30–70 years. Regression models showed significantly higher all-cause mortality in the incident sarcoidosis cohort compared to matched controls [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.73 (95% CI: 1.63 to 1.83)] Figure 1Age and sex standardised incidence, prevalence and mortality of sarcoidosis in England
Conclusion:
The incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis are rising in England, with notable rises amongst males and individuals aged 60 and older. Younger patients with sarcoidosis are at increased risk of death compared to matched controls. Acknowledging the growing burden of this disease, along with shifting demographic trends, is crucial for optimising healthcare policies and ensuring the effective allocation of healthcare resources.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, and newly developed models have demonstrated promising potential, yet their diagnostic performance for critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings remains underexplored. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis quality, and response quality in critical illness cases of four newly developed LLMs.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, four newly developed LLMs—ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-V3, and DeepSeek-R1—were evaluated using 50 critical illness cases in ICU settings from published literature. Diagnostic accuracy and response quality were compared across models.
Results
A total of 50 critical illness cases were included. ChatGPT-o3 achieved the top diagnosis accuracy at 72 % (36/50; 95 % CI 0.600–0.840), followed by DeepSeek-R1 at 68 % (34/50; 95 % CI 0.540–0.800), ChatGPT-4o at 64 % (32/50; 95 % CI 0.500–0.760), and DeepSeek-V3 at 32 % (16/50; 95 % CI 0.200–0.460). ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o all significantly outperformed DeepSeek-V3, with no significant differences among the three. The median differential quality score was 5.0 for ChatGPT-o3 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), DeepSeek-R1 (IQR 5.0–5.0; 95 % CI 5.0–5.0), and ChatGPT-4o (IQR 4.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.5–5.0), and 4.0 for DeepSeek-V3 (IQR 3.0–5.0; 95 % CI 4.0–5.0). ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 scored significantly higher than DeepSeek-V3; ChatGPT-4o showed a non-significant trend toward better performance.All models received high Likert ratings for response completeness, clarity, and usefulness. ChatGPT-o3, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT-4o each showed a trend toward better response quality compared to DeepSeek-V3, although no significant differences were observed among the models.
Conclusions
The newly developed models, especially the reasoning models, demonstrated strong potential in supporting diagnosis in critical illness cases in ICU settings. With further domain-specific fine-tuning, their diagnostic accuracy could be further enhanced. Notably, the open-source reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 performed competitively, suggesting strong potential for scalable deployment in resource-limited settings.}

CTR prediction hinges on effectively modeling consumers’ product interests based on their historical behavior. However, extant CTR studies have not fully integrated consumer purchase history with other behavior histories such as browsing, adding to cart, and adding to favorites. How should we fully leverage the rich behavior history to extract personal interest and that of similar others? When extracting similar others’ interests, how should we maintain the relevance to personal interests while enjoying the novelty of others’ interests? To address these issues, we conceptualize two types of consumer interest: manifested interests and potentially shared interests when building their interest profile. We propose the Augmented Deep Multi-Behavior Interest Network (ADMBIN) to extract, integrate, and balance the two types of interest from the multi-behavior sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the ADMBIN outperforms benchmark models in CTR prediction and the contribution of our design components. The proposed model can boost advertising revenue and improve consumer experience.}

abstract = {Background
Understanding whether biopsychosocial and biomechanical factors are related in patellofemoral pain (PFP) could help to clarify the underlying mechanisms of this dysfunction.
Objective
To investigate whether fear of movement is associated with hip and knee muscle strength; trunk and lower limb frontal kinematics; plantar pressure, and stabilometric measures in women with and without PFP.
Method
PFP (n = 18) and asymptomatic (n = 18) women answered the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia; underwent strength tests of knee extensors, hip abductors, and hip extensors; and performed the single-leg squat test to determine trunk, pelvis, and knee frontal angles, and baropodometric measurements. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed (p < 0.05).
Results
In the PFP group, fear of movement correlated with knee extensor (r = −0.529, p = 0.024) and hip abductor torque (r = −0.534, p = 0.023); ipsilateral trunk inclination (r = 0.505, p = 0.033); amplitude (r = 0.545, p = 0.019), velocity (r = 0.713, p = 0.001), and standard deviation of anteroposterior oscillation (r = 0.714, p = 0.001), standard deviation of mediolateral oscillation (r = 0.579, p = 0.012), and total displacement of the center of pressure (CoP) (r = 0.637, p = 0.004). It was predicted (p = 0.000, R2 = 0.82) by ipsilateral trunk inclination (B = 0.40, p = 0.040); amplitude of anteroposterior oscillation (B = −0.13, p = 0.013), and standard deviation of anteroposterior (B = 0.78, p = 0.001) and mediolateral CoP oscillation (B = 1.33, p = 0.001). In the control group, there was no significant correlation.
Conclusion
Fear of movement is related to decreased knee extensor and hip abductor strength, increased ipsilateral trunk inclination, and postural instability in women with PFP.}

The affected fish displayed symptoms including fin ulcers and white spots, which were confirmed through clinical testing conducted at Dalian Ocean University. Microscopic examinations revealed a substantial presence of black dot-like unicellular parasites on the gills of the diseased fish. Further analyses, including methyl green-pyronine staining, optical microscopy, and biological scanning electron microscopy, facilitated the identification of the parasite as Amyloodinium ocellatum. Additionally, bacterial isolation and culture, Gram staining, physiological and biochemical testing, 16S rDNA sequence analysis, phylogenetic tree, and drug sensitivity experiments were performed on the organs of the affected fish. The results identified two dominant bacterial strains, Vibrio scophthalmi and Vibrio harveyi, present in the spleen and kidney of the infected fish. Antibiotic sensitivity tests indicated that V. scophthalmi is susceptible to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and enrofloxacin, while V. harveyi showed sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, and ofloxacin. In conclusion, this case was determined to be a combined infection involving both parasites and bacteria. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for the prevention and control of epidemics affecting Takifugu rubripes.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite an expanding scope of practice, uptake of advanced clinical services is hindered by pharmacists’ self-efficacy in high-stakes decision-making. Traditional experiential learning builds confidence but is constrained by preceptor shortages, scheduling conflicts, and travel requirements. This study evaluates an artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinical training program designed to replace in-person warfarin-management rotations.
Methods
This mixed-methods study assessed the impact of the Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy course on learners’ confidence and satisfaction. The course combines online modules with a virtual clinic that simulates a full clinical rotation, including patient encounters, therapeutic decisions, documentation, and structured feedback. Surveys administered after the online modules and again after completing the virtual clinic captured confidence (5-point Likert) and program satisfaction; free-text responses underwent content analysis.
Results
Of 287 participants (96.9% pharmacists), mean confidence on a 5-point Likert scale increased from baseline (1.92) to post-modules (3.85) and further after the virtual clinic (4.24). Approximately 40% experienced additional gains following simulations. Virtual simulations were ranked the most valuable component (69%). Qualitative analysis yielded 4 themes: experiential consolidation of learning, virtual experience comparable to in-person training, complementary role of preparatory materials, and technical refinements needed.
Conclusion
The artificial intelligence-enabled virtual clinic effectively replaced traditional clinical rotations and enhanced confidence in warfarin care. Graduates’ patients later achieved the highest time in therapeutic range reported in Canadian general practice, supporting real-world impact. The Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy model may mitigate preceptor shortages and deliver standardized experiential training; broader validation across therapeutic areas and learner groups is warranted.}

Therefore, this study aims to build a structured BHR knowledge graph based on multi-modal data, providing sufficient structured knowledge for BHR enhancement. An automated knowledge graph construction approach is proposed to empower the ontology design and triple extraction by large language models (LLMs), and validation processes based on In-context Learning (ICL) prompts. A case study is conducted to construct the knowledge graph of BHR under rainstorms in Hong Kong. The performance of the proposed LLMs-empowered knowledge extraction is also validated based on natural language processing metrics and LLMs-based Evaluation (LLMs-Eval). BHR knowledge graph indicates the potential relations between disasters, factors, response actions, and the health status of the building and occupants, and provides insight to guide the BHR enhancement. The superiority of the proposed LLMs-empowered automated knowledge graph construction approach is proven, implying LLMs have great potential in knowledge graph construction, not only for BHR but also for other concepts that require structured knowledge for further explorations and analyses.}

keywords = {Currarino syndrome, Sacrococcygeal teratoma, Surveillance},
abstract = {Background
Currarino syndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by a triad of anorectal malformation, sacral agenesis, and presacral mass, often a teratoma. Comparative outcomes of sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) in Currarino versus non-syndromic cases are not well defined.
Methods
A multicenter retrospective review of pediatric SCT resections from 2010 to 2020 was conducted across 11 institutions in the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of Currarino syndrome. Demographic, surgical, pathologic, and long-term outcome data were analyzed. The primary outcome was tumor recurrence.
Results
Of 203 patients, 25 (12.3 %) had Currarino syndrome. Currarino patients were more often diagnosed postnatally (80 % vs. 25 %, p < 0.001) and had predominantly Altman type IV tumors (87 % vs. 17 %, p < 0.001). All tumors in the Currarino cohort were mature teratomas, while 27 % of non-Currarino tumors were immature and 12 % were malignant (p < 0.001). Tumors in Currarino patients were significantly smaller in size (median 3.3 cm vs. 8.0 cm, p < 0.001). Recurrence rates were low and comparable (4 % Currarino vs. 10 % non-Currarino, p = 0.18). Currarino patients had higher rates of urinary incontinence (44 % vs. 28 %, p = 0.048) and constipation (76 % vs. 32 %, p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a trend toward improved recurrence-free survival in Currarino patients, though not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Pediatric patients with Currarino-associated SCTs have excellent long-term outcomes, with low recurrence rates likely attributable to benign tumor histology and high rates of complete resection. These findings suggest that surveillance strategies may be tailored for Currarino patients to reduce unnecessary imaging and long-term follow-up burden.

abstract = {Background
Medical education can be challenging for students as they must manage vast amounts of complex information. Traditional mnemonic resources often follow a standardized approach, which may not accommodate diverse learning styles.
Objective
This tutorial presents a student-developed approach to creating personalized multimodal mnemonics (PMMs) using artifical intelligence tools.
Methods
This tutorial demonstrates a structured implementation process using ChatGPT (GPT-4 model) for text mnemonic generation and DALL-E 3 for visual mnemonic creation. We detail the prompt engineering framework, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques. The process involves (1) template development, (2) refinement, (3) personalization, (4) mnemonic specification, and (5) quality control. The implementation time typically ranges from 2 to 5 minutes per concept, with 1 to 3 iterations needed for optimal results.
Results
Through systematic testing across 6 medical concepts, the implementation process achieved an initial success rate of 85%, improving to 95% after refinement. Key challenges included maintaining medical accuracy (addressed through specific terminology in prompts), ensuring visual clarity (improved through anatomical detail specifications), and achieving integration of text and visuals (resolved through structured review protocols). This tutorial provides practical templates, troubleshooting strategies, and quality control measures to address common implementation challenges.
Conclusions
This tutorial offers medical students a practical framework for creating personalized learning tools using artificial intelligence. By following the detailed prompt engineering process and quality control measures, students can efficiently generate customized mnemonics while avoiding common pitfalls. The approach emphasizes human oversight and iterative refinement to ensure medical accuracy and educational value. The elimination of the need for developing separate databases of mnemonics streamlines the learning process.}

abstract = {Background
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge in medical education. In dental specialties such as endodontics, effective learning requires access to both textual clinical evidence and visual procedural demonstrations. However, generic LLMs often produce content that lacks clinical accuracy, contextual grounding, or pedagogical clarity, thereby limiting their applicability in specialized training environments.
Objective
To develop and evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced LLMs framework that addresses the challenge of integrating domain-specific knowledge in AI-driven endodontic education.
Method
We present Endodontics-KB, a multimodal knowledge integration platform that combines evidence-based dental literature (e.g., textbooks, clinical guidelines) with visual instructional materials (e.g., procedural videos) through a hierarchical RAG architecture. The system’s core component, the EndoQ chatbot, utilizes LLMs augmented with multimodal dental datasets to enable context-aware clinical reasoning. Benchmarking was conducted against three general-purpose LLMs: GPT-4, Qwen2.5, and DeepSeek R1, using a structured question bank comprising 11 expert-validated endodontic questions. Two domain experts performed a blinded evaluation across five performance dimensions: clinical accuracy, contextual relevance, completeness, decision-making professionalism, and communication fluency.
Results
The framework integrated 2,200 multimodal knowledge units through dynamic semantic indexing. EndoQ demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all evaluation metrics compared to general purpose LLMs: accuracy (4.45 ± 0.96), clinical relevance (4.59 ± 0.8), completeness (4.27 ± 0.83), professionalism judgment (4.45 ± 1.06), and language fluency (4.86 ± 0.47), as measured on a 5-point Likert scale.
Conclusion
This proposed framework improves educational outcomes through precise and context-aware knowledge delivery. Furthermore, it represents a scalable and transferable model for AI-enhanced clinical training across medical specialties, significantly advancing competency-based pedagogy in dental education.}

While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a “skeletonized” form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data used in the method are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.}

abstract = {Introduction
In infants undergoing bowel resection, side-to-side stapled anastomosis (SSA) may restore intestinal continuity. We describe cases of abnormal symptomatic intestinal dilation secondary to SSA in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS).
Case presentation
Case 1 is an infant who underwent SSA for meconium ileus. He developed progressive malabsorption and was found to have a dilated segment of 9 by 8 cm at the prior SSA. This was narrowed into two lumens. He continues to gain weight appropriately. Case 2 is an infant with compartment syndrome resulting in partial colectomy and small bowel resection. Continuity was restored with SSA. On abdominal exploration years later for persistent abdominal pain, the area of prior SSA measured 14 by 9 cm and was narrowed into two lumens. He has excelled postoperatively. Case 3 and Case 4 are older patients referred after initial resection and SSAs as infants. Both had adequate intestinal length excluding their dilated areas and underwent resection with redo SSA as young adults. Both continue to do well. Case 5 is an ex-premature boy with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and two prior SSAs. He developed chronic pain and underwent resection of dilated intestine with redo SSA. This dilation recurred at the new SSA two years later. He then underwent division back into two lumens. He is now doing well.
Conclusion
In patients undergoing bowel resection, SSA can cause abnormal dilatation requiring narrowing. Based on these outcomes, we caution against SSA in patients with anticipated SBS.}

Against the backdrop of explosive growth in galaxy observation data, how to quickly identify the number of spiral arms has become an important issue in the study of spiral galaxies. The research is based on the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) dataset and studies the ResNet (Residual Networks) model's method of identifying the number of spiral arms from spiral galaxy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the ResNet32 model is 83%, which is the best compared to network models such as ViT (Vision Transformer), EfficientNet, and DenseNet. In terms of recognition of different numbers of spiral arms, there is a strong relationship between recognition accuracy and the number of training samples. There are 6800 images with 2 spiral arms, with an F1-Score value of 0.9, while there are only 237 images with 4 spiral arms, with the lowest F1-Score value. The experiment further analyzed the recognition effect of fused traditional galaxy image features and found that the role of fused traditional galaxy image features in improving the recognition of spiral arms is limited.}

abstract = {Digital surgery is being increasingly used in phraseology and clinical application, driven by the advancing tide of technology. Its scope in treating patients with colorectal cancer is reviewed. A search was performed to include a breadth of digital technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), mobile health, and simulation. Many digital roles were identified in the 60 studies included. These were clinician-facing or patient-facing throughout the patient’s journey (screening, preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative) and involved the broader team (trainees, oncology, pathology). Colorectal cancer screening was improved via the use of digital technology, including virtual health assistants. Preoperative patient-facing VR enhances consent and reduces perioperative anxiety. For surgeons, enhanced awareness of vascular and visceral anatomy relative to the tumour helped with surgical planning, with the emerging concepts of ‘virtual colectomy’ and ‘digital clone’. Pathologically, AI more accurately predicts lymph node metastasis following endoscopic polyp cancer excision, thus reducing over-treatment with surgery, and assesses the response to neoadjuvant treatment to guide selective surgery. Intraoperatively, AI facilitates real-time detection of anatomical landmarks, including autonomic nerves, ureters, and areolar tissue, to indicate the dissection plane. These intraoperative studies lacked a control group and outcome reporting (intraoperative, clinical, oncological, or functional), highlighting that this technology requires further development and study. There is a paucity of evidence regarding AR, such as intraoperative holographic overlay. Postoperative patient-facing digital technology can promote enhanced recovery, improve physical activity, and reduce sick-role maladaptation. For clinicians, AI can predict the short-term (complications) and long-term (survival) patient prognosis. VR could play an increasing role in training, with some evidence from validated virtual curricula. In summary, digital surgery has potential applications throughout the patient journey and along the virtuality continuum, showing advantages over conventional approaches in the preoperative and postoperative phases. Intraoperative, AI and AR methods have not yet been shown to have clinically significant advantages. As its scope grows, there are emerging implications for training, regulation, and ethics.}

Therefore, our study explored the ability of two versions of GPT models – i.e., GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) and GPT-4 – to generate assessment feedback on students' writing assessment tasks, common in higher education, with open-ended topics for a data science-related course. We compared the feedback generated by GPT models (namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) with the feedback provided by human instructors in terms of readability, effectiveness (content containing effective feedback components), and reliability (correct assessment on student performance). Results showed that (1) both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were able to generate more readable feedback with greater consistency than human instructors, (2) GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and human instructors in providing feedback containing information about effective feedback dimensions, including feeding-up, feeding-forward, process level, and self-regulation level, and (3) GPT-4 demonstrated higher reliability of feedback compared to GPT-3.5.

abstract = {Objective
Hypothermic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) without an apparent abrupt cause for hypothermia presents a dilemma for emergency physicians. This study compared outcomes among hypothermic and normothermic OOHCA arrest patients “found down” following unwitnessed arrest who required ongoing chest compressions in the emergency department (ED).
Methods
This secondary analysis of Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epistry 3 data included OOHCA patients ≥15 years old transported to hospital by EMS who required continued or recurrent chest compressions in the ED. Per current resuscitation guidelines, patients with initial core temperatures <30 °C were considered hypothermic; temperatures between 35 °C and 38 °C were classified as normothermic. We excluded patients with initial temperatures recorded >30 min after arrival. We compared survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge and survival with good neurologic status (i.e., Modified Rankin Scale ≤2) for hypothermic and normothermic patients. Sensitivity analyses explored alternate hypothermia cut-points (< 35 °C; 28 °C).
Results
The primary analysis included 22 hypothermic and 416 normothermic patients. Outcomes for hypothermic and normothermic patients did not significantly differ: survival to hospital admission was 13.6 % vs. 28.6 % (difference −15 %, CI: −30.0 %; +0.01 %); survival to hospital discharge was 4.6 % vs. 3.1 % (difference + 1.4 %, CI: −4.2 %; +13.3 %); survival with good neurologic status was 4.6 % vs. 1.2 % (difference + 3.4 %, CI: −5.4 %; +12.1 %). Using alternative cut-points to define hypothermia did not meaningfully alter the results.
Conclusion
In this analysis, outcomes did not differ for hypothermic and normothermic adult OOHCA patients “found down” following unwitnessed OOHCA who required continued chest compressions in the ED.}

The role that marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may play in reducing the risk for developing depression and/or anxiety is unclear.
Objective
The present study examined the relationships between plasma levels of total omega-3 PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the non-DHA omega-3 PUFAs with medical-record documented depression and/or anxiety (both historical and recent, within the last 12 months) in the UK Biobank. The associations of these outcomes with the reported use of fish oil supplements (FOS) were also examined.
Methods
Data from 258,354 participants who had data on plasma omega-3 PUFA levels and all covariates were used for the biomarker-based analyses, and data from 468,145 people who reported FOS use at baseline were used in the latter analysis.
Results
We found that all three omega-3 PUFA metrics were inversely associated with a history of both depression and anxiety. Specifically, risk for the former outcome was between 15% and 33% lower in Q5 vs Q1, and for the latter outcome, between 19% to 22% lower comparing Q5 with Q1. Risk for recent depression was 29% and 32% lower (Q5 vs Q1) for total omega-3 PUFAs and for non-DHA, respectively. FOS use was associated with a 9-10% lower risk for a history of depression and anxiety, respectively, and a 20% lower risk for recent anxiety.
Conclusion
We found evidence that higher levels of omega-3 PUFAs may play a protective role in depression and anxiety.}

However, little is known about how teachers leverage this potential. This study examines the beliefs and reported practices of primary school teachers in Switzerland and Germany regarding their promotion of metacognitive strategies through a digital learning environment (DLE, i.e. LearningView). DLEs offer various technological features that can be used to support students’ planning, monitoring, and reflecting on their learning processes. The aim of the study is to understand the teacher’s role in these aspects through the DLE LearningView. Qualitative content analysis of 20 teacher interviews reveals that most teachers adopt a combined approach to the promotion of metacognitive strategies, utilizing both digital and analog methods. In general, teachers used a greater degree of implicit over explicit promotion activities to promote students’ metacognitive strategies in DLEs. The findings suggest a connection between teachers' beliefs and reported practices and highlight the importance of teachers’ perception of themselves as coaches during learning. Our study underscores the need for teacher training to effectively integrate digital and analog approaches for promoting SRL. Given the rapidly changing learning environments due to digitalization, future research should prioritize exploring adaptive learning technology and the role of digital feedback, employing methodologies such as classroom observations or a quantitative methodological approach. Achieving a balanced interplay between teachers, students, and digital tools seems imperative to optimize metacognitive learning in the 21st century classroom.}

GPT-3 and BERT models expanded their scope from traditional NLP areas to the new realms of screens, audio, images, and video, redefining AI in the process. The future is certain to bring further changes, with prompt engineering likely to become an important skill for making full use of LLMs. By giving clear, context-sensitive, and specific instructions, users can optimize outputs—but issues such as ambiguity, bias, and side effects need to be addressed to ensure that results are ethically sound, accurate, and practical.

The architecture of LLMs, their training, and their fine-tuning, all based on transformers, attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and encoder-decoder structures, reveals their pros and cons. Computational efficiency should always be the top priority in designing LLMs. Also, there are new development stages to be in the future: in these, propositional knowledge will have more emphasis, and transference both from and between different realms of AI into a new era of intelligent, accountable systems, without which truly likely governance problems may arise.}

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for drug delivery due to their high drug-loading capacity, tunable porosity, and structural diversity. However, their clinical translation is hindered by concerns over biocompatibility. Unfortunately, experiments are resource and time intensive, while modeling approaches fail to capture the behavior of MOFs in intricate biological systems. Herein, we report a machine learning (ML)-guided computational pipeline for probing MOF biocompatibility. Using a database of over 35,000 organic molecules, our interpretable ML models predict the toxicity of MOF linkers with over 80% accuracy across different administration routes. Furthermore, we cataloged the toxicity of MOF metallic centers and screened 86,000 MOFs from the Cambridge Structural Database, identifying candidates with minimal toxicity profiles. Beyond screening, our models provide insights into chemical features of biocompatible MOFs—enabling de novo rational design. This framework expedites the discovery of safer MOFs for drug delivery and deepens the understanding of their underlying chemistry.}

While evasion of the variants from adaptive immunity is widely investigated, there is a paucity of knowledge about their interactions with innate immunity. Inflammasome assembly is one of the most potent mechanisms of the early innate response to viruses, but when it is inappropriate, it can perpetuate tissue damage. In this study, we focused on the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We compared the macrophage activation, particularly the inflammasome formation, using Alpha- and Delta-spike virus-like particles (VLPs). We found that VLPs of both variants activated the inflammasome even without a priming step. Delta-spike VLPs had a significantly stronger effect on triggering pyroptosis and inflammasome assembly in THP-1 macrophages than did Alfa-spike VLPs. Cells treated with Delta VLPs showed greater cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β release. Furthermore, Delta VLPs induced stronger cytokine secretion from macrophages and caused essential impairment of mitochondrial respiration in comparison to Alpha VLPs. Additionally, infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with the SARS-CoV-2 variants confirmed the observations in VLPs. Collectively, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Delta had a greater impact on the inflammasome activation, cell death and mitochondrial respiration in macrophages than did the Alpha variant. Importantly, the differential response to the SARS-CoV-2 variants can influence the efficacy of therapies targeting the host's innate immunity.}

abstract = {Introduction
Enhanced Recovery Pathways (ERP) have gained popularity for optimizing perioperative care, improving patient outcomes, and reducing hospital stays. While extensively studied in adult populations, ERPs in pediatric patients, especially for thyroid surgeries, are uncommon. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an ERP designed for pediatric patients undergoing single-lobe thyroidectomy.
Methods
This prospective study was conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 and involved children 8 years of age or older undergoing single lobe thyroidectomy. Patients with significant comorbid conditions or undergoing total thyroidectomy were excluded. The ERP incorporated standardized preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. Outcome measures were postoperative pain, incidence of postoperative nausea, time to discharge, and patient/parent satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results
16 patients were included, predominantly female (81.3 %, n = 13), ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. The median surgical time was 63 min (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 56.5, 75). Following surgery, patients spent a median of 60 min (IQR: 43, 63.5) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 217 min (IQR: 189, 260) in the transitional care unit (TCU) before discharge. Adherence to the ERP was high, with 100 % compliance to the order set. 81 % of patients experienced no nausea or vomiting in the PACU/TCU. A single patient required an extended stay due to postoperative nausea, for same-day discharge success rate of 93.8 %. Post-discharge, 93.8 % of patients reported no nausea, and pain was effectively managed without opioid use in 68.8 % of patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patients required readmission, and all reported high satisfaction with the care received on post-operative satisfaction survey (mean score = 5/5).
Discussion
Implementation of a pediatric ERP for single-lobe thyroidectomy was successful in promoting same-day discharge, effective pain control without opioids, healthcare utilization management, high patient satisfaction. These findings suggest that ERPs can be safely and effectively adapted for select pediatric thyroid surgery, potentially setting a new standard for perioperative care in this population.

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.
Resumen
Objetivo
Evaluar la utilidad diagnóstica de la Excreción fraccional de Sodio (FENa), Excreción fraccional de potasio (FEK) y uSID (diferencia de aniones fuertes urinaria) en el diagnóstico de la IRA persistente (IRAp).
Ámbito
2 unidades de cuidados intensivos en Argentina.
Pacientes
Adultos con diagnóstico de sepsis o shock séptico e injuria renal aguda (IRA) y disponibilidad de una bioquímica urinaria dentro de las 24hs del diagnóstico de la IRA.
Intervención

Variables de interés principales
Evaluamos la capacidad diagnóstica de la FENa y FEK y la brecha aniónica urinaria mediante un análisis de la curva ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic).
Resultados
Se incluyeron 40 pacientes en cada grupo (IRAp vs transitoria). Los pacientes con IRAp tuvieron mayor APACHE, SOFA y mortalidad. En el análisis de las curvas ROC, la uSID no demostró utilidad diagnóstica (AUC=0.52). La FENa presentó moderada precisión con un AUC de 0.71 (IC95% 0.60–0.83), mientras que la FEK tuvo un AUC de 0.69 (IC95% 0.57−0.80). El punto de Youden para diferenciar IRAp para la FENa fue de 0.51% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 72.5%. En el caso de la FEK, el punto óptimo fue de 21.9% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 67.5%.
Conclusiones
La interpretación de la bioquímica urinaria en pacientes sépticos debe ser revisada. La FENa y FEK están relacionados con la severidad de la IRA y pueden ser herramientas diagnósticas complementarias de utilidad.}

However, due to users' limited familiarity with domain-specific knowledge, their underspecified queries often introduce intent uncertainty, impeding the generation of responses that are both contextually relevant and operationally executable. To address this challenge, we propose uncertainty-aware augmented generation (UAG), a novel deep learning method that jointly detects user intents and quantifies their associated uncertainty, thereby bridging the gap between user queries and enterprise-executable actions. UAG enhances intent detection along a predefined intent tree by incorporating two hierarchical consistency losses, and improves the quality of generated responses by leveraging salient intent paths—extracted using a proposed uncertainty-aware intent (UI) score—as an augmented prompt. Experiment results based on two datasets showed that UAG outperformed state-of-the-art alternative benchmarks, and explanatory analysis rendered insight on the role of uncertainty in user intent detection and response generation.}

To systematically define humanizing health care to guide systems improvements that better meet patient and health care workers’ needs.
Participants and Methods
We conducted group concept mapping at Johns Hopkins Medicine, a large academic health system with five hospitals in Maryland and Washington, DC, outpatient practices, telemedicine, and homecare services. From October 2023 to May 2024, we recruited participants who brainstormed to the focus prompt: “One thing that can be done to more fully humanize healthcare experiences is:” The study team synthesized ideas for participants to sort them. Group concept mapping software generated cluster maps, which were interpreted by the study team to generate the concept map.
Results
In brainstorming, 63 individuals participated, including those with the perspectives of patients (n=40, 63%), caregivers (n=25, 40%), physicians (n=23, 37%), other types of health care professionals (n=14, 22%), health professions educators (n=28, 44%), and health care researchers (n=25, 40%). The 395 statements from brainstorming were synthesized into 207 ideas for sorting, which was completed by 13 participants. The final concept map included eight domains and 32 subdomains. Domains addressed: (1) effective communication, (2) health care worker attitudes, (3) health care culture, (4) health care worker community, (5) institutional policies and health care value, (6) physical and digital systems and access to care, (7) time and attention for patients, and (8) embedding patient perspectives throughout health care.
Conclusion
Health care is fundamentally about human experiences. This concept map, generated by individuals representing the perspectives of a variety of individuals involved in health care, offers guidance for interventions and measures to make health care more humanizing.}

We compared the Spring and Fall administration pass rates of initial primary certification candidates for those who graduated in the same year they took the examination. We also compared the pass rates of same-year graduates with individuals who postponed the examination for a year or more. We also surveyed the candidates regarding the reasons they chose the Spring or Fall administration. Candidates who chose the earlier (i.e., Spring) administration were more likely to pass compared with those who took the later Fall administration (p = 0.0026 for Anatomic Pathology; p = 0.0004 for Clinical Pathology). Delaying the certifying exams beyond the calendar year of residency graduation was associated with a higher failure rate (p < 0.0001 for both Anatomic and Clinical Pathology). The survey results suggest that residents often take their certification examinations earlier to not interfere with fellowship training, because it coincides with the completion of residency training, or it is expected by their program. Pathology residents are more likely to pass the primary certification examinations when they are taken closer to the end of training, rather than postponing it to a later administration. Pathology residency program directors should encourage residents, who are deemed ready, to take their certification examinations at the earliest possible administration.}

Recently, we found that suppression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) exhibits renoprotective effects in acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study investigated the hypothesis that temporal suppression of SPARC in the early stages of I/R-injury might lead to the prevention of renal injury in the chronic phase. The left renal pedicle of male BALB/c mice was occluded for 45 min after right uninephrectomy and subsequently reperfused for 28 days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting SPARC was injected intravenously 1 day before and 3 days after I/R. Histological assessment revealed that SPARC knockdown by siRNA attenuated tubular injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the overexpression of 4-hydroxynonenal, a marker of lipid peroxidation. I/R-induced overexpression of a major source of superoxide NADPH oxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by siRNA targeting SPARC. Treatment with siRNA targeting SPARC reduced the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS1), which colocalizes with SPARC. In conclusion, SPARC might be a potential therapeutic target for preventing CKD development following acute I/R injury.}

However, stable bone fixation is crucial for successful fusion and to prevent complications like non-union. While early approaches focused on minimally invasive techniques to preserve the fibula's vascular network, stable internal fixation has become favored in preventing complications. This article aims to systematically describe bone fixation options for vascularized fibula grafts in the upper limb based on extensive experience, recommending internal fixation over external methods, such as long plates for humerus reconstruction.

To overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on multi-view input and depth estimation, we propose a multi-view synthesis method for Chinese landscape paintings, termed MVSM-CLP. The proposed CLPDepth Module employs a high-low resolution fusion mechanism to enhance detail expression while preserving the original scene structure. We introduce an image restoration technique guided by landscape ink lines, termed LInpainting, to improve edge extraction and the accuracy of painting inpainting Additionally, our method tackles the issue of scarce 3D data in current view synthesis efforts by constructing multi-view data from a single ancient painting. Our approach effectively bridges the gap between 2D art and 3D visualization, creating vivid and realistic virtual environments while preserving the traditional style and essence of Chinese paintings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality multi-view synthesis, offering new possibilities for the digital preservation of cultural heritage.

Surgical consent forms convey critical information; yet, their complex language can limit patient comprehension. Large language models (LLMs) can simplify complex information and improve readability, but evidence of the impact of LLM-generated modifications on content preservation in non-English consent forms is lacking.
Objective
This study evaluates the impact of LLM-assisted editing on the readability and content quality of surgical consent forms in Korean—particularly consent documents for standardized liver resection—across multiple institutions.
Methods
Standardized liver resection consent forms were collected from 7 South Korean medical institutions, and these forms were simplified using ChatGPT-4o. Thereafter, readability was assessed using KReaD and Natmal indices, while text structure was evaluated based on character count, word count, sentence count, words per sentence, and difficult word ratio. Content quality was analyzed across 4 domains—risk, benefit, alternative, and overall impression—using evaluations from 7 liver resection specialists. Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired 2-sided t tests, and a linear mixed-effects model was applied to account for institutional and evaluator variability.
Results
Artificial intelligence–assisted editing significantly improved readability, reducing the KReaD score from 1777 (SD 28.47) to 1335.6 (SD 59.95) (P<.001) and the Natmal score from 1452.3 (SD 88.67) to 1245.3 (SD 96.96) (P=.007). Sentence length and difficult word ratio decreased significantly, contributing to increased accessibility (P<.05). However, content quality analysis showed a decline in the risk description scores (before: 2.29, SD 0.47 vs after: 1.92, SD 0.32; P=.06) and overall impression scores (before: 2.21, SD 0.49 vs after: 1.71, SD 0.64; P=.13). The linear mixed-effects model confirmed significant reductions in risk descriptions (β₁=−0.371; P=.01) and overall impression (β₁=−0.500; P=.03), suggesting potential omissions in critical safety information. Despite this, qualitative analysis indicated that evaluators did not find explicit omissions but perceived the text as overly simplified and less professional.
Conclusions
Although LLM-assisted surgical consent forms significantly enhance readability, they may compromise certain aspects of content completeness, particularly in risk disclosure. These findings highlight the need for a balanced approach that maintains accessibility while ensuring medical and legal accuracy. Future research should include patient-centered evaluations to assess comprehension and informed decision-making as well as broader multilingual validation to determine LLM applicability across diverse health care settings.}

Active tuberculosis drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM) is recommended in the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. We established comprehensive aDSM and conducted a nationwide multicenter prospective study in Taiwan.
Methods
We designed a treatment initiation form to capture characteristics of patients at baseline, a treatment review form to monitor symptoms, blood tests, QT intervals, and audiometry during treatment, and an adverse event report form for reporting severe adverse events (grade 3 or more), serious adverse events and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Severity of adverse events were categorized by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03, and causality was assessed by using the World Health Organization – Uppsala Monitoring Centre system.
Results
Of 333 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis enrolled from May 2017 to February 2020, 329 (98.8 %) had adverse events and 196 (58.9 %) had severe adverse events during treatment. The top three severe adverse events were metabolism disorders (104, 31.2 %), hearing impairment (102, 30.6 %), and hepatotoxicity (64, 19.2 %). Of 403 severe adverse events reported, 284 (70.5 %) were classified as drug-related.

This study examines whether artificial intelligence promotes shared prosperity among service industry enterprises based on microdata of listed companies in the Chinese service industry from 2008 to 2022. The main research results indicate that the application of artificial intelligence in the service industry significantly reduces enterprises' labor income share. The main mechanisms of action include the employment structure effect of squeezing out low-educated and frontline workers and the wage-productivity effect that improves labor productivity but benefits capital income, leading to an unequal income distribution. Research has found that improving the integration of regional labor markets and workers' bargaining power can help alleviate the negative effects of artificial intelligence applications on the share of labor income in the service industry. This study helps developing countries, such as China, manage the impact of the widespread application of artificial intelligence on the labor market in the service industry and provides important policy insights for achieving common prosperity.}

Traditional manual design process is costly and time-consuming, while optimization methods heavily depend on expert knowledge. Recent advancements in deep generative models present promising alternatives. However, their application to the generation of prefabricated construction site layouts is hindered by several challenges, including limited datasets, significant overlap between facilities, and the necessity to generate layouts based on fixed facilities with specific attributes such as minimal transportation costs. These challenges constrain the efficacy and applicability of the generated layouts. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative automated generative design system for prefabricated construction site layouts, leveraging a novel Transformer-based conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). The data preparation module of the system collects and augments layout data for training. The CSLGAN module is designed to generate layouts that conform to spatial constraints and desired attributes, with minimal facility overlap. Furthermore, this study establishes benchmarks in terms of model capacity and specialized performance metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in automated construction site layout generation.}

abstract = {Importance
Large language models (LLMs) hold potential in clinical decision-making, especially for complex and rare disease diagnoses. However, real-world applications require further evaluation for accuracy and utility.
Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, ERNIE, and Llama-3) using real-world inpatient medical records and assess the impact of different prompt engineering methods.
Method
This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at Peking University International Hospital. It involved 1,122 medical records categorized into common rheumatic autoimmune diseases, rare rheumatic autoimmune diseases, and non-rheumatic diseases. Four LLMs were evaluated using two prompt engineering methods: few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. Diagnostic accuracy (hit1) was defined as the inclusion of the first final diagnosis from the medical record in the model’s top prediction.
Results
Hit1 of four LLMs were as follows: GPT-4omini (81.8 %), GPT-4o (82.4 %), ERNIE (82.9 %) and Llama-3 (82.7 %). Few-shot prompting significantly improved GPT-4o’s hit1 (85.9 %) compared to its base model (p = 0.02), outperforming other models (all p < 0.05). Chain-of-thought prompting showed no significant improvement. Hit1 for both common and rare rheumatic diseases was consistently higher than that for non-rheumatic disease. Few-shot prompting increased costs per correct diagnosis for GPT-4o by approximately ¥4.54.
Conclusions
LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrate promising diagnostic accuracy on real medical records. Few-shot prompting enhances performance but at higher costs, underscoring the need for accuracy improvements and cost management. These findings inform LLM development in Chinese medical contexts and highlight the necessity for further multi-center validation.}

To make a cross-cultural adaptation of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) from English to Angolan Portuguese.
Methods
A methodological research of cross-cultural adaptation was conducted, involving sequential stages of forward translation, translation synthesis, back-translation, and the application of the Delphi Panel methodology for analyzing semantic, idiomatic, experiential, and conceptual equivalence between the translated and the original versions. This process culminated in the development of a pre-final version, which subsequently underwent testing in a cohort of nurses (n = 37). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was calculated to assess inter-rater reliability of ratings. Cronbach's alpha was used for evaluating the internal consistency and reliability within the items of the NEWS 2 score.
Results
The cross-cultural adaptation process allowed us to prepare the final version of this tool. The data collected during the testing phase facilitated the examination of inter-rater reliability of ratings and the internal consistency and reliability within the items of the NEWS2 score. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient observed at this step was 0.992. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.993.
Conclusion
The cross-cultural adaptation of the NEWS 2 scoring system to Angolan Portuguese was successful, providing healthcare professionals in Angola with the means to effectively use the tool.}

Although groundbreaking performances of large language models (LLMs) have inspired many researchers to consider an LLM as a potential BIM control method using natural language, a specific method of utilizing LLMs for automated BIM model detailing has not yet been proposed. This paper proposes an LLM-BIM chaining framework to enable architectural design detailing using natural language, instead of using menu-based user interfaces, named “Natural-language-based Architectural Detailing through Interaction with AI (NADIA)”. The NADIA framework is based on three main approaches: 1) separating the specification of the wall layers from the creation of the wall layers; 2) appropriate instruction prompting to guide the LLM to minimize irrational responses and produce engineering rational details; and 3) LLM-BIM chaining to seamlessly link a BIM authoring tool and an LLM. The effectiveness of NADIA was validated based on two main aspects: its accuracy in generating details that adhere to specified design requirements from users—as a design assistant—and its compliance with general engineering requirements—as a design consultant. The validation was achieved through tasks that involved generating 240 and 1,920 exterior wall details, respectively. NADIA achieved an average accuracy of 83.33% in generating logically coherent details in line with the required design conditions. For thermal performance requirements, it demonstrated a mean accuracy of 98.54% in complying with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 20.1–2019 standard. Despite being in its early stages, NADIA’s potential for developing and refining architectural details through natural language-based interactions between architects and machines is promising.}

To compare pharmacy student scores to scores of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated results of three common platforms on pharmacy skills laboratory assignments.
Methods
Pharmacy skills laboratory course assignments were completed by four fourth-year pharmacy student investigators with three free AI platforms: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Assignments evaluated were calculations, patient case vignettes, in-depth patient cases, drug information questions, and a reflection activity. Course coordinators graded the AI-generated submissions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize AI scores and compare averages to recent pharmacy student cohorts. Interrater reliability for the four student investigators completing the assignments was assessed.
Results
Fourteen skills laboratory assignments were completed utilizing three different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) by four fourth-year student investigators (n = 168 AI-generated submissions). Copilot was unable to complete 12; therefore, 156 AI-generated submissions were graded by the faculty course coordinators for accuracy and scored from 0 to 100 %. Pharmacy student cohort scores were higher than the average AI scores for all of the skills laboratory assignments except for two in-depth patient cases completed with ChatGPT. Conclusion. Pharmacy students on average performed better on most skills laboratory assignments than three commonly used artificial intelligence platforms. Teaching students the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing AI in the classroom is essential.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chemotherapy can induce a range of unpleasant adverse effects, with oral mucositis being one of the most common. This condition significantly impacts patients' quality of life and can disrupt their adherence to treatment protocols. Oral mucositis serves as an important limiting factor in chemotherapy, often necessitating dose reductions or treatment delays, which in turn can compromise the overall effectiveness of the therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of melatonin mouthwash on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.
Methods
Following the preparation of melatonin and placebo mouthwashes, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients with solid tumor malignancies who had no oral lesions and were treated with chemotherapy regimens. The patients began using the mouthwash on the first day of their corresponding chemotherapy course, continuing for six weeks with a frequency of three times daily, 4mL per application. At the end of each week, the patients were evaluated for the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain. Quality of life was assessed at the study's start and weekly thereafter.
Results
Seventy patients were randomized into melatonin (n = 35) and placebo (n = 35) groups. The melatonin group had a lower incidence of mucositis (11.43 % versus 34.28 %), with a relative risk of 0.74 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.56 to 0.96). The severity of mucositis showed statistically significant differences between the melatonin and placebo groups at the end of the fifth week (P = 0.003) and the sixth week (P = 0.002). Additionally, the intensity of pain caused by mucositis demonstrated statistically significant differences at the end of the third week (P = 0.021), the fifth week (P = 0.001), and the sixth week (P = 0.001). There was also a significant difference in the overall duration of mucositis between the melatonin and placebo groups (mean difference -8.83, 95 %CI: -14.54 to -3.12). The mouthwash was well tolerated in both groups.
Conclusion
The findings of this study suggest that melatonin mouthwash is effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis. A six-week regimen of melatonin mouthwash significantly reduces the severity and duration of mucositis, as well as the associated pain intensity.}

abstract = {Background
The gold standard method for diagnosing low bone mineral density (BMD) is using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) however, most patients with low BMD are often not screened. We aimed to create a deep learning (DL) model to screen for osteoporosis/osteopenia in patients by using radiographs of the foot or ankle.
Method
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients aged ≥50 years who received X-rays of the foot or ankle and DXA (gold-standard) within 12 months. The 907 (White (96.7 %), Black (1.8 %) and Asian (0.4 %)) patients (3109 radiographs) were randomized (80:20) into training/validation and test datasets, and results were assessed by patient. We developed a novel DL model that extracted deep features from the radiographs of the foot and ankle using a customized architecture. The diagnostic performance of this DL model to predict if a patient had low BMD (osteopenic/osteoporotic) or normal BMD based on DXA, was evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results
Mean patient age (standard deviation) was 66.9(9.0) years, and 84.6 % were female. 81.3 % and 18.7 % of patients in the training/validation dataset, and 81.5 % and 18.5 % of patients in the test datasets were osteopenic/osteoporotic and normal respectively. The DL model had an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI (0.85, 0.94), sensitivity of 89.89 %, specificity of 83.65 %, PPV of 90.78 % and NPV of 74.14 % in the test dataset. The model had an accuracy of 94.65 % in the training/validation dataset and 89.89 % in the test datasets.
Conclusion
Our DL model has the potential to identify patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis using foot or ankle radiographs with high accuracy.}
