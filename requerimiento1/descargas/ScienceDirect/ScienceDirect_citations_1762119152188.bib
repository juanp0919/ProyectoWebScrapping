abstract = {In the 21st century, health care has been going through a paradigm shift called digital health. Due to major advances and breakthroughs in information technologies, most recently artificial intelligence, the patriarchy of the doctor-patient relationship has started evolving toward an equal-level partnership with initial signs of patient autonomy. Being an underused resource for centuries, patients have started to contribute to their care with information, data, insights, preferences, and knowledge. It is important to recognize that at its core, digital health represents a cultural transformation, where patient empowerment has likely played the most significant role in driving these changes. This viewpoint paper traces the remarkable journey of patient empowerment from its nascent stages to its current prominence in shaping health care’s future. Spanning over two and a half decades, we explore pivotal moments and technological advancements that have revolutionized the patient’s role in health care. We dive into a few historical milestones, mainly in the United States, that have challenged and redefined societal norms around agency, drawing parallels between patient empowerment and broader social movements, such as the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements. Through these lenses, we argue that patient empowerment is not solely a function of knowledge or technology but requires a fundamental shift in societal attitudes, policies, health care culture, and practices. As we look to the future, we posit that the continued empowerment of patients will play a pivotal role in the development of more equitable, effective, and personalized health care systems. This paper calls for an ongoing commitment to fostering environments that support patient agency, access to resources, and the realization of patient potential in navigating and contributing to their health outcomes with an emphasis on the emerging significance of patient design.}

The research explores the relationship between shareholder structure and CSR investment, and the mediating role of analyst coverage. The results indicate that ownership structure significantly influences CSR investment, with ownership concentration and checks and balances positively correlated with CSR. The research also finds that analyst coverage mediates the relationship between ownership structure and CSR investment. Specifically, state - owned enterprises (SOEs) exhibit higher CSR investments compared to non - SOEs, and the shareholding structure of SOEs has a more pronounced impact on CSR investment. The findings suggest that enhancing ownership concentration and balance can effectively improve CSR value. The research concludes that a balanced equity structure and increased analyst coverage promote CSR investment, contributing to sustainable corporate development. The results have implications for policymakers, suggesting that refining shareholding structures to emphasize concentration and balance can better align corporate strategies with social responsibilities, fostering harmonious advancement of financial, community, and ecological interests.}

abstract = {Objective
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have improved many aspects of healthcare but also introduced challenges, including increased documentation and reduced patient-provider interaction. With recent artificial intelligence (AI) developments in the EHR landscape, such as Automated Medical Reporting (AMR) technologies that aim to automate visit summarization, there is a need to understand how these innovations affect medical interactions. However, methodological inconsistencies in existing studies on EHR use and medical interactions limit study comparability. This scoping review identifies methods to study the impact of EHR use on patient-provider interaction, providing a foundation for future evaluations of AMR implementations.
Methods
A systematic search identified empirical studies (2015-present) on patient-provider interaction involving EHRs, supplemented by three prior reviews. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction focused on research methods, concepts, indicators, and measurement tools used.
Results
The review identified diverse methods to study EHR use within medical interactions, including video/audio analysis, structured observation, surveys, and interviews. Studies focused on concepts such as patient-centered communication, attention, satisfaction, computer interaction, and room layout, using diverse standardized and self-developed instruments. Most studies treated EHR use as separate from medical interaction. A smaller group used qualitative methods, such as conversation analysis and ethnography, to explore how EHR use is embedded in medical interaction. Indicators included gaze, typing, talk time, and consultation length.
Conclusion
Two dominant approaches emerged: one treating EHR use as separate from medical interaction, and another, less common, viewing both as functionally integrated. While various concepts and instruments were identified, many studies relied on unvalidated, non-experimental methods, limiting comparability and causal inference. A key gap remains in standardized methods that link broad communication concepts with specific functional behaviors. As AI-driven tools like AMR emerge, future research needs to adopt more integrative approaches to assess their impact and support human-centered EHR design.}

abstract = {In recent years, considerable advancements have been made in developing in vitro models to better understand the complex dynamics of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its critical role in neurological health and disease. Incorporating astrocytes into these models introduces an essential layer of complexity, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of the cellular interactions and regulatory mechanisms that maintain BBB integrity and functionality. Despite these advances, the specific influence of astrocytes on endothelial cells in in vitro systems remains inadequately explored. This study addresses this gap by examining the transcriptional changes in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) cocultured with human astrocytes (HAs). Our findings demonstrate that astrocytes profoundly modulate endothelial pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and division while upregulating genes associated with BBB integrity, protective mechanisms, and transporter activity. Furthermore, astrocytes significantly enhanced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced permeability to tracer Cascade Blue dye, confirming their functional impact on BBB models. By providing a comprehensive human primary cell dataset, this research underscores the pivotal role astrocytes play in shaping endothelial cell gene expression and function in contact coculture systems. These results emphasize the necessity of incorporating astrocytes into in vitro BBB models to accurately replicate neurovascular interactions. Ultimately, this study advances our understanding of BBB physiology and highlights the importance of refining in vitro models to better reflect the complexity of the human neurovascular environment, with potential implications for studying neurological disorders and drug delivery strategies.}

However, modern network infrastructures are increasingly complex, with growing volumes of data making real-time traffic prediction and analysis more challenging. To cope with this issue, a custom autonomous agent has been designed to automate network traffic analysis and prediction in an efficient manner. Unlike general-purpose autonomous agents such as babyAGI and autoGPT, the presented agent is specifically tailored for network traffic management, incorporating domain-specific optimizations for data extraction, classification, and forecasting. The agent processes user requests by determining whether traffic analysis or prediction is required, extracting relevant data, generating predictions when necessary, and writing structured reports to assist network operators in decision-making. The approach was tested by implementing LLama 8B and ChatGPT 4.0 Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide useful information and improve the responses of the LLM. The results prove the efficacy of the RAG, showcasing a noticeable improvement in the factual accuracy in a subset of 40 intents implemented in a real-case scenario. The factual accuracy indicator showcased some robustness, reaching results in a range from 70% to 100% for both LLMs. The results prove the potential of agent-driven approaches to enhance automation and efficiency in network traffic analysis, demonstrating their applicability in real-world scenarios.}

There is a paucity of literature examining how preferences differ amongst various demographic groups. This study aimed to assess how perceptions of the ideal breast differ between respondents stratified by self-identified demographic factors. A cohort of 25 patients from the senior surgeon’s practice presenting for breast surgery was assembled. Pre-operative anteroposterior photographs of these patients were distributed via Qualtrics (Seattle, WA) to a large sample designed to be representative of the demographics of the United States. Survey questions aimed to measure respondents’ impressions of 'breast attractiveness'. Respondents were asked to rate breasts on a Likert scale. Survey responses were analysed for differences in breast aesthetic preferences by sex, gender, sexual orientation, and race. Males rated all breasts higher on the Likert scale for attractiveness than females (2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). Despite this discrepancy, ratings amongst male and female respondents were highly correlated with one another (R = 0.940; p < 0.0001). Considering sexual orientation, individuals attracted to women provided significantly higher attractiveness ratings to all breasts compared to individuals attracted to men only (2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). White or Caucasian individuals ascribed significantly higher breast attractiveness ratings than Asian individuals (2.7 vs 2.2, p < 0.001), but not Black or African American individuals (2.7 vs 2.4, p = 0.23). Despite these racial discrepancies in mean breast attractiveness, ratings amongst the three groups were highly correlated. In a sample representative of the United States, a difference in breast aesthetic appraisal was observed by demographic factors. These findings merit further investigation to understand these trends and observations.}

The Glottal Area Waveform (GAW) is an important component in quantitative clinical voice assessment, providing valuable insights into vocal fold function. In this study, we introduce a novel method employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic GAWs. Our approach enables the creation of synthetic GAWs that closely replicate real-world data, offering a versatile tool for researchers and clinicians. We elucidate the process of manipulating the VAE latent space using the Glottal Opening Vector (GlOVe). The GlOVe allows precise control over the synthetic closure and opening of the vocal folds. By utilizing the GlOVe, we generate synthetic laryngeal biosignals. These biosignals accurately reflect vocal fold behavior, allowing for the emulation of realistic glottal opening changes. This manipulation extends to the introduction of arbitrary oscillations in the vocal folds, closely resembling real vocal fold oscillations. The range of factor coefficient values enables the generation of diverse biosignals with varying frequencies and amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that this approach yields highly accurate laryngeal biosignals, with the Normalized Mean Absolute Error values for various frequencies ranging from 9.6 ⋅ 10−3 to 1.20 ⋅ 10−2 for different experimented frequencies, alongside a remarkable training effectiveness, reflected in reductions of up to approximately 89.52% in key loss components. This proposed method may have implications for downstream speech synthesis and phonetics research, offering the potential for advanced and natural-sounding speech technologies.}

abstract = {Background
Globally, the incidence of breast cancer continues to rise; however, mortality rates are declining due to the growing effectiveness of targeted therapies and treatments. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is seen in ∼15% of breast cancers (termed HER2+). Trastuzumab is the standard HER2-targeted therapy for HER2+ breast cancers in the adjuvant setting, and is increasingly being used as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NACT or NAC). However, as well as the clinical impact, using drugs in a different treatment setting (including neoadjuvant) has a financial impact. Economic evaluation of novel chemotherapeutic strategies can assess both clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, thereby informing and guiding healthcare resource allocation decisions. Currently, the cost, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of single-agent neoadjuvant Trastuzumab remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Trastuzumab administered as neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, or a combination of both regimens (NACT/ACT).
Methods
A 3-year retrospective observational comparative analysis was conducted to examine costs and health outcomes using clinicopathological data (treatment type, surgical procedure, breast cancer subtype) from a public hospital in Ireland. Overall, 192 non-metastatic, non-palliative HER2+ breast cancer patients (Luminal B HER2, and HER2+ [non-luminal]) were selected (151 adjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 28 neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 13 NACT/ACT Trastuzumab treated). The analysis estimated the cost of treatment (chemotherapy regimen, surgery type) and health outcomes, which were evaluated by analysis of survival data, and by calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs). Multivariate regression analysis, using survival regression model techniques, was performed to evaluate associations between treatment types and total costs- adjusted by age, stage, grade, and subtype. A Cox proportional hazard model estimated the effect of treatment alternatives for time to disease-free survival (DFS).
Results
Multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in treatment cost (p=0.318), surgery cost (p=0.951), or DFS (p=0.236) between the adjuvant and neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treatment groups. A significantly increased cost of treatment was observed in older patients (p=0.011) and patients with Grade 3 tumours (p=0.037). No significant difference in cost was found between the HER2 subtype groups (p=0.129) or between disease stages (p=0.71). No significant difference in QALY was observed between adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment groups (p=0.296).
Conclusion
Overall, while adjuvant Trastuzumab remains the most cost-effective strategy for patients with HER2+ breast cancer, adopting a neoadjuvant Trastuzumab approach does not appear to pose a significant economic disadvantage. Notably, higher treatment costs were observed among older patients, a finding with important financial implications for healthcare systems. These results highlight the need for careful evaluation to inform forthcoming age-related cancer policy updates.}

However, the majority of existing methods have overlooked the specific requirements and challenges inherent in fusion tasks under low-light conditions. In such scenes, texture degradation due to poor illumination is common, and furthermore, local overexposure may result in significant information loss. To tackle these challenges, a novel framework named BICFusion is introduced, which addresses these issues through reflectance separation, cross-modal feature compensation, and dual enhancement of texture and contrast. The Retinex theory is employed to design a network that extracts reflectance representing the intrinsic structure and details of the scene from the visible image, thereby providing the fusion result with rich structural information under minimal illumination constraints. The cross-modal feature guidance weighting module (CFGW) is developed to compensate for missing details by leveraging the infrared image when the visible image lacks sufficient texture information due to adverse lighting conditions such as low light or overexposure. Subsequently, the texture enhancement fusion module (TEFM) and the global-local contrast enhancement loss function are proposed to jointly enhance the fusion quality in terms of texture and contrast. Experiments conducted with twelve state-of-the-art methods on three publicly available datasets validate the superior performance of BICFusion in preserving fine details under low-light and overexposed conditions.}

Background
The surgical outcomes and stability of patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion determine the success of treatment. Variations in surgical interventions, patient responsiveness, and growth patterns across vertical facial morphologies result in varying treatment outcomes and postoperative stability.
Methods
This retrospective study recruited 52 adults diagnosed with skeletal Class II malocclusion treated with bimaxillary surgery; these adults were divided into two groups according to their vertical facial patterns. Cone-beam computed tomography images were collected before surgery (T0), after surgery (T1), and after orthodontic treatment (T2). Reconstructed three-dimensional images were used for cephalometric measurements and analysis.
Results
From T0 to T1, the Frankfort-mandibular plane angle decreased in the high-angle group but increased in the low–medium-angle group. The mandible advanced 9.02 and 6.21 mm in the high-angle and low–medium-angle groups, respectively. From T1 to T2, significant changes were observed in the anterior mandible horizontal movement of the high-angle group (−1.91 ± 3.63 mm) compared with the low–medium-angle group (−0.57 ± 1.04 mm). There were more patients exhibit clinically significant relapse (> 2 mm) in the high-angle group (44%) than in the low–medium-angle group (20%).
Conclusion
The relapse patterns in the two groups were similarly upward and backward. However, the high angle group exhibited greater average postoperative changes. The proportion of patients who exhibited a clinically significant relapse was higher in the high angle group.}

In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.
Resumen
Objetivo
Evaluar la utilidad diagnóstica de la Excreción fraccional de Sodio (FENa), Excreción fraccional de potasio (FEK) y uSID (diferencia de aniones fuertes urinaria) en el diagnóstico de la IRA persistente (IRAp).
Ámbito
2 unidades de cuidados intensivos en Argentina.
Pacientes
Adultos con diagnóstico de sepsis o shock séptico e injuria renal aguda (IRA) y disponibilidad de una bioquímica urinaria dentro de las 24hs del diagnóstico de la IRA.
Intervención
Ninguna.
Variables de interés principales
Evaluamos la capacidad diagnóstica de la FENa y FEK y la brecha aniónica urinaria mediante un análisis de la curva ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic).
Resultados
Se incluyeron 40 pacientes en cada grupo (IRAp vs transitoria). Los pacientes con IRAp tuvieron mayor APACHE, SOFA y mortalidad. En el análisis de las curvas ROC, la uSID no demostró utilidad diagnóstica (AUC=0.52). La FENa presentó moderada precisión con un AUC de 0.71 (IC95% 0.60–0.83), mientras que la FEK tuvo un AUC de 0.69 (IC95% 0.57−0.80). El punto de Youden para diferenciar IRAp para la FENa fue de 0.51% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 72.5%. En el caso de la FEK, el punto óptimo fue de 21.9% con una sensibilidad de 65.0% y una especificidad de 67.5%.
Conclusiones
La interpretación de la bioquímica urinaria en pacientes sépticos debe ser revisada. La FENa y FEK están relacionados con la severidad de la IRA y pueden ser herramientas diagnósticas complementarias de utilidad.}

abstract = {Bortezomib is a mainstay drug for the treatment of myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, but resistance frequently develops. Overcoming bortezomib resistance is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that acevaltrate, an active ingredient from a traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits potent activity in triggering pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Mechanistically, acevaltrate induces myeloma cells pyroptosis in a Caspase-3 and GSDME-dependent manner. When Caspase-3 is inhibited by its specific inhibitor or GSDME is knocked out, myeloma cells fail to undergo pyroptosis triggered by acevaltrate. Moreover, acevaltrate promotes the production of reactive oxygen species and strikingly reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with this finding, acevaltrate dissociates BAX from its inhibitor, Bcl-2, thereby promoting BAX translocalization to mitochondria. Furthermore, IFIT3, an IFN-inducible protein, is upregulated by acevaltrate. Interestingly, while IFIT3 fails to directly induce myeloma cells pyroptosis, it markedly enhances acevaltrate-induced pyroptosis. IFIT3 binds to Bcl-2 and prevents it from interacting with BAX. Lastly, acevaltrate effectively triggers pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Pre-treatment with acevaltrate significantly restores the sensitivity of resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib. Therefore, acevaltrate strongly induces myeloma cell pyroptosis and overcomes bortezomib resistance. Given its potent activity against myeloma and its established safety profile, acevaltrate warrants further evaluation in clinical settings for its potential to overcome myeloma resistance to bortezomib.}

abstract = {Introduction
Despite existing guidelines, many patients with asthma do not achieve adequate control of their disease. This is largely due to low adherence to inhaled therapy. Single-inhaler administration may improve this and other aspects of asthma therapy, such as cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study is to gather the opinions of a panel of experts on single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) for the treatment of asthma in adult patients.
Material and methods
A recommendation task force reviewed the available evidence and formulated 45 statements divided into 5 sections: efficacy, cost-effectiveness, therapeutic adherence, safety, and patient satisfaction. A validation task force of 71 experts evaluated these recommendations using the 2-round Delphi technique. Panellists rated their agreement with each statement on a 9-point scale.
Results
Consensus was achieved in 42 of the 45 statements. Panellists broadly agreed that SITT improves lung function, reduces exacerbations, is cost-effective, and promotes therapeutic adherence. The safety of TT was considered favourable, even in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. The panellists also agreed on the importance of evaluating patient satisfaction with the inhaler. However, no consensus was reached regarding the suitability of TT as a first-line treatment, nor on whether TT is more beneficial than up-dosing ICS in patients with a low inflammatory profile currently receiving dual therapy. Additionally, panellists did not agree on whether sick leave due to respiratory causes was associated with greater adherence to TT.
Conclusions
The consensus indicates that SITT is considered an effective, safe option for the treatment of asthma that improves therapeutic adherence and patient satisfaction. Further real-world studies are needed to evaluate its implementation in different clinical contexts.
Resumen
Introducción
A pesar de las directrices existentes, muchos pacientes con asma no logran un control adecuado de la enfermedad. Esto se debe en gran parte a la baja adhesión a la terapia inhalada. La administración en dispositivo único puede mejorar este y otros aspectos, como coste-efectividad del tratamiento. Este estudio tiene como objetivo desarrollar un consenso de expertos sobre la triple terapia (TT) en un solo inhalador para el tratamiento del asma en pacientes adultos.
Material y métodos
Un grupo elaborador de recomendaciones revisó la evidencia disponible y formuló 45 enunciados divididos en cinco bloques: eficacia, coste-efectividad, adhesión, seguridad y satisfacción del paciente. Un grupo validador de 71 expertos evaluó estas recomendaciones mediante el método Delphi en dos rondas. Los panelistas calificaron cada enunciado en una escala de 9 puntos para determinar su grado de acuerdo.
Resultados
Se alcanzó consenso en 42 de los 45 enunciados. Los panelistas mostraron amplio acuerdo en la eficacia de la TT en dispositivo único para mejorar la función pulmonar y reducir exacerbaciones, así como en su buen perfil de coste-efectividad y de adhesión al tratamiento. La seguridad de la TT fue considerada favorable, incluso en pacientes con comorbilidades cardiovasculares. Los panelistas también estuvieron de acuerdo en la importancia de la satisfacción del paciente con el dispositivo inhalador. Sin embargo, no se alcanzó consenso sobre la idoneidad de la TT como tratamiento de primera línea, ni sobre si la TT es más beneficiosa que el aumento de dosis de CSI en pacientes con un perfil inflamatorio bajo que ya reciben doble terapia. Además, los panelistas no estuvieron de acuerdo en que la baja laboral por causas respiratorias estuviera asociada con una mayor adhesión a la TT en dispositivo único.
Conclusiones
El consenso indica que la TT en un solo dispositivo se considera una opción efectiva y segura para el tratamiento del asma, mejorando la adherencia y la satisfacción del paciente. Se destaca la necesidad de más estudios en vida real para evaluar su implementación en diferentes contextos clínicos.}

abstract = {Background
Vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) present a resurgent threat to global health security and jeopardize decades of advancements in public health and economic development. Since 1974, childhood vaccinations are estimated to have prevented 154 million deaths from VPD, yet recent declines in routine vaccination rates highlight the global population's growing vulnerability to these diseases. When paired with appropriate access to healthcare and trusted information, evidence informed enforceable policies have demonstrably improved childhood vaccination rates in countries that have recently implemented more stringent laws on routine vaccination. Here we comprehensively map and describe the current legal environment for childhood vaccination.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the childhood vaccination-related policies in 194 countries. Policies were systematically identified, collated, and categorized into a publicly available tool.
Results
A total of 106 countries have legally-enforceable policies requiring vaccination for at least one disease. We found that vaccines against diphtheria, measles, and tetanus were the most universally mandated, while vaccines against COVID-19 and Japanese Encephalitis were mandated by the fewest countries. In 91 countries, childhood vaccination requirements are enforced through either legal sanctions, such as monetary fines or incarceration, through exclusion from congregate settings, or through some combination of the two.
Conclusion
Analyses of the efficacy of childhood vaccination laws are predicated upon a comprehensive mapping of the current legal landscape related to routine immunization. Public health officials and researchers with an interest in increasing routine childhood vaccination rates in their country must know what characteristics of policy have been effective across various contexts. Our mapping of legally-enforceable childhood vaccination policies is foundational for assessing current vulnerabilities to vaccine-preventable diseases and future policy analyses.}

We recruited 75 students and provided them with sequential failure feedback based on self-comparison or social-comparison, and their performance on the three components of EF was subsequently recorded. Results indicated that for the perfectionists, receiving feedback that their performance was inferior to others served as a stronger facilitator of EF than when they performed worse than their own goals. Moreover, individual differences were observed. The Mixed-perfectionism group, i.e., those high in both Perfectionism striving (PS) and Perfectionism concern (PC), were more sensitive to social-comparison feedback, whereas those in the Pure PS group were more sensitive to self-comparison feedback. Additionally, the extent of these effects varied across the three components of EF. Strategies for maximizing the facilitative effects of feedback on cognition based on individual differences are discussed.}

In the site selection phase for GCS projects, the saturation of irreducible water is a vital indicator used to calculate the storage capacity and assess the feasibility of GCS projects. Due to its high efficiency in characterizing the petrophysical properties of porous rocks, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is an indispensable tool for analyzing irreducible water. However, limited core samples and time-consuming experiments result in scarce matched NMR data from centrifuged and saturated states, challenging the study of irreducible water for GCS projects through machine learning. Moreover, the traditional single T2 cutoff methods for determining irreducible water saturation exhibit significant errors, making precise calculation of storage capacity challenging. To overcome these obstacles, the application of Generative Adversarial Networks is proposed to enhance training data richness and lay a foundation for using machine learning to investigate irreducible water properties. When selecting the appropriate data form and network structure, amplitude variations in T2 distributions at saturated and centrifuged states were considered, and the generator and discriminator models developed with the data form of type 1 showed the best performance. Furthermore, the Random Forest algorithm is introduced to predict the tapered T2 cutoff value, further deriving the T2 distribution of irreducible water and ultimately yielding more accurate irreducible water saturation. This accurate assessment is essential for calculating both static and dynamic storage capacities, which provide critical benchmarks for project operators in source-sink matching, ensuring efficient and cost-effective storage objectives. Additionally, it enables the acquisition of the T2 distribution of free water, which is difficult to obtain with traditional methods. This extra information can provide more guidance for the site selection and injection phases of GCS projects. The proposed method, by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, offers significant improvements over traditional methods in investigating irreducible water properties, presenting a promising application outlook in GCS projects.}

This study investigates the impact of user experience on user stickiness in governmental chatbots, employing a segmented, scenario-based approach to assess variations across different user groups and technology levels. By analyzing data from groups with either practical or policy-oriented knowledge, the study explores how the integration of basic and advanced artificial intelligence technologies influences the retention of users interacting with governmental digital services. The core findings reveal that user experience significantly enhances user stickiness across all scenarios and user types, independent of the users' level of online institutionalized political participation. This study indicates that the effectiveness of user experience strategies in governmental chatbots is largely autonomous from the users' political engagement, suggesting that the intrinsic quality of the user interface is a more critical factor in promoting user retention than previously understood.}

Colleges and schools of pharmacy have implemented co-curricular programs that complement didactic and experiential learning within Doctor of Pharmacy programs. These programs are varied but all are directed at achieving educational outcomes, which may change based on accreditation standards.
Objective
The objective of this project was to describe student and faculty perceptions of the co-curricular program in one doctor of pharmacy program.
Methods
Two surveys were developed to assess the co-curricular program, one for faculty and one for students. Both surveys consisted of quantitative and qualitative elements, and both were comprised of three sections: overall program satisfaction, activities and reflections, and program logistics. Surveys were distributed via email to all Doctor of Pharmacy students and faculty and remained open for two weeks.
Results
Response rate for the faculty and student surveys was 59.3 % (19 of 32) and 48.2 % (131 of 272), respectively. Overall satisfaction with the co-curricular program was rated as a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 6–8) for faculty and a median of 6 (IQR, 5–8) for students on a 10-point scale with 10 being the most highly satisfied and one being not satisfied at all. Qualitative results revealed that faculty and students supported the program and its intent but find room for improvements. Suggested improvements included: ensuring consistent offerings of co-curricular activities in both quantity and quality, decreasing the number of required reflections, and encouraging timeliness and quality in student submissions and in faculty reviews.
Conclusion

abstract = {Background and Aims
Posterior pelvic ring disruption has been associated with high-energy trauma, and significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine functional and radiological outcomes following sacroiliac screw fixation of posterior pelvic ring injuries at a major trauma centre.
Methods
Patients who underwent sacroiliac screw fixation at our institution, between 1st January 2013 – 1st April 2020 were identified from a database. Electronic systems were accessed to obtain information regarding patient demographics, injuries sustained, and interventions performed. Patients were contacted via telephone regarding clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L, EQVAS and Majeed scores). Radiographical outcomes were assessed using the Keshishyan cross-measure method.
Results
115 patients were identified. The mean age at injury was 51.6 years (17–84 years). Most injuries resulted from falls and road traffic collisions (83.5 %). Eighty patients (69.6 %) sustained additional non-pelvic injuries and twenty-nine (25.2 %) underwent a non-pelvic procedure, most commonly limb or clavicle fracture fixation (N = 19). Thirty-day and 12-month all-cause mortality rates were 0.9 % and 1.7 %, respectively. Clinical outcomes were obtained for 82/105 possible patients (78.1 %). Regarding EQ5D3L, 36/82 patients (43.9 %) reported a full health status; only six patients reported severe problems. The mean Majeed score was 70.3. 49/59 patients (86.0 %) returned to their pre-injury employment. A significant association was found between the clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L index, EQVAS, Majeed score) and the pre-operative asymmetry value and deformity index but not the post-operative asymmetry value and deformity index. One patient (0.9 %) required revision for infection, 12 patients (10.4 %) reported post-operative lower limb paraesthesia, and one patient (0.9 %) experienced a post-operative deep vein thrombus.
Conclusions
Most patients with pelvic ring injuries experienced high-energy trauma, often resulting in multiple injuries and operative interventions. Nevertheless, mortality rates were low, and most patients experienced either mild or no functional difficulties. The magnitude of the pelvic deformity pre-operatively correlates with post-operative clinical scores.}

Nephrolithiasis is not a well-documented condition in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is possible that this condition was underestimated before the era of nusinersen because of a much shorter life expectancy. We present our observational data on nephrolithiasis and its possible risk factors in children with type 1 SMA.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 20 children with genetically confirmed type 1 SMA. Thirteen patients (aged 9 to 55 months) who underwent urinary tract ultrasonography were included in the study. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics, ultrasound results, and metabolic abnormalities.
Results
Seven children (54%) had nephrolithiasis; 5 had multiple stones and two had a single stone. Two patients had microlithiasis (<3 mm), three had a stone in the size of 3 to 5 mm, and one had a stone in the size of more than 8 mm. Two patients with nephrolithiasis had urinary tract abnormalities. Patients with nephrolithiasis were more likely to have a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (P = 0.048) and higher urine specific gravity (P = 0.014) than patients without nephrolithiasis. Five of seven children with nephrolithiasis had a urine metabolic evaluation; all had hypercalciuria, three had hyperuricosuria, but none had hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, or hypomagnesemia.
Conclusion
Children with SMA type 1 are at an increased risk for nephrolithiasis. Hypercalciuria and high urine specific gravity appear to be the most common risk factors for the occurrence of nephrolithiasis. In addition, UTI is more common in patients with type 1 SMA with nephrolithiasis.}

abstract = {Hypothesis
Although antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of new antibiotics, their inherent susceptibility to degradation requires nanocarrier-mediated delivery. While cubosome nanocarriers have been extensively studied for delivery of AMPs, we do not currently understand why cubosome encapsulation improves antimicrobial efficacy for some compounds but not others. This study therefore aims to investigate the link between the mechanism of action and permeation efficiency of the peptides, their encapsulation efficacy, and the antimicrobial activity of these systems.
Experiments
Encapsulation and delivery of Indolicidin, and its ultra-short derivative, Priscilicidin, were investigated using SAXS, cryo-TEM and circular dichroism. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand the loading of these peptides within cubosomes. The antimicrobial efficacy was assessed against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (MRSA) bacteria.
Findings
A high ionic strength solution was required to facilitate high loading of the cationic AMPs, with bilayer encapsulation driven by tryptophan and Fmoc moieties. Cubosome encapsulation did not improve the antimicrobial efficacy of the AMPs consistent with their high permeation, as explained by a recent ’diffusion to capture model’. This suggests that cubosome encapsulation may not be an effective strategy for all antimicrobial compounds, paving the way for improved selection of nanocarriers for AMPs, and other antimicrobial compounds.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Children undergoing orthopedic procedures often present numerous risk factors for thromboembolism. A recent survey, conducted by the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA), indicates that pediatric orthopedic surgeons are unaware of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention protocols and feel that certain procedures should require thromboprophylaxis. The aim of this systematic review was to properly assess the incidence of VTE in pediatric orthopedics. By using a thorough and broad search of the literature, the incidence according to different subspecialties of pediatric orthopedics was evaluated.
Methods
A systematic review on VTE in pediatric orthopedics was conducted. Four databases were searched for articles reporting these events. Three major search concepts: “pediatrics”, “orthopedic surgery/trauma” and “VTE complications” were used and broken down in MeSH, EmTree and their free vocabulary synonyms for proper literature review. Two independent authors screened 8467 titles and abstracts. Seventy articles reporting VTE in children treated by orthopedic surgeons were selected for data extraction. We reported median incidences by orthopedic subtypes and by study characteristics with a semi-quantitative review model.
Results
The 70 articles yielded a total of 845,010 participants. Spine articles (33/70) provided 25,2% of the children included in the review. Trauma studies (16/70) accounted for 47.5% of the participants. The overall VTE median incidence was 0.16% [95% CI: 0.0–1.01%]. Musculoskeletal infections had a noticeably higher median incidence of 3.5% [CI: 0.0–13.8%]. Small variations were seen for the other subtypes: trauma, spine and elective surgeries. Subgroups by article characteristics did not differ significantly either.
Conclusion
Thrombotic complications are rare events in pediatric orthopedics, but knowledge epidemiologic is important because its potential severity. In this review, VTE median incidence for all orthopedic subtypes was around 0.16% [CI: 0.0–1.01%]. According to subspecialty assessment, musculoskeletal infections were associated with greater risk of VTE occurrence.

As the metaverse has garnered considerable attention, many metaverse platforms have explosively launched. The intensified competition among metaverse platforms is increasing the value of third-party developers, who play a role of complementors in platform ecosystems as creating virtual properties. Despite the significant role of developers in the sustainability of these nascent metaverse platforms, our understanding of their choice of platforms remains sparse. The study employed an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is widely recognized for its efficiency in evaluating and ranking criteria at various levels within a hierarchical structure, aiding in systematic decision-making. The study scrutinizes not only the weights of three evaluation criteria (market attractiveness, technological readiness, and platform readiness), which have been commonly used in research on platform complementors, along with their sub-criteria, but also probes into developers' ultimate choice of specific platforms. Findings show that while user size, a sub-criterion of market attractiveness, emerges as the most crucial factor, the support of the developer community is less significant, differing from previous research findings. The study not only significantly enhances our understanding of the contemporary metaverse ecosystem, but also enriches knowledge of platform complementors.}

Fasting prior to percutaneous cardiac procedures is common, despite a lack of high-quality evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety of a nonfasting strategy. Online databases Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were searched. Quantitative analysis was performed using R software (Version 4.1.2) with meta package. Analyzed outcomes included nausea, vomiting, aspiration, intubation, hypoglycemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury, patient satisfaction score, and length of hospital stay. Eight randomized controlled trials were included with 3,382 patients. There was no significant difference between fasting and nonfasting for nausea/vomiting odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95% CI, 0.68-1.45), hypoglycemia OR 1.28 (95% CI, 0.75-2.18), aspiration OR 0.72 (95% CI, 0.36-1.43), acute kidney injury OR 0.69 (95% CI, 0.38-1.23), and hypotension OR 1.57 (95% CI, 0.47-5.30). No patient in either group underwent endotracheal intubation. Additionally, there was no difference in patient satisfaction score and length of hospital stay with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95% CI, -0.62 to 1.07) and 0.0 (95% CI, -0.6 to 0.7) respectively. Sub-group analysis, however, showed increased odds of nausea/vomiting in the fasting group compared to nonfasting OR 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04-1.39) and decreased odds of acute kidney injury in fasting compared to nonfasting group OR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.28-0.89). In conclusion, this analysis shows no significant difference in most safety outcomes between a fasting and a nonfasting strategy with potential increase in nausea/vomiting and decrease in acute kidney injury with fasting. More studies are needed to better understand these differences.}

abstract = {Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity in elderly individuals and remain a persistent challenge for medical professionals. This study aimed to identify the bacteria causing community-acquired (CA) UTIs in older patients, determine their antimicrobial resistance patterns, assess the prevalence of polymicrobial infections, and identify the risk factors.
Methods
Urine samples were obtained from patients with symptomatic UTIs and then cultured on blood and MacConkey agar. Positive cultures were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the VITEK 2 system.
Results
Polymicrobial infections were found in 69/427 (16.16 %) of older patients with CA-UTIs and associated with diabetes (p = 0.007), previous antimicrobial use (p = 0.025), and recurrent urinary infections (p = 0.043). Escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (57.26 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in 15.32 % of CA-UTIs. Escherichia coli was more common in non-diabetic patients (60.81 %) than diabetes (43.69 %). However, the rates of Klebsiella species were higher in diabetes (20.39 %) than non-diabetes (14.50 %). Gram-negative uropathogens showed 49.89 % resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, while imipenem is the least resistant (7.19 %). The gram-positive uropathogens were resistant to 9.80 % of linezolid and highly resistant to erythromycin (74.51 %), tetracycline (72.55 %), and gentamicin (70.59 %).
Conclusions
Escherichia coli isolates were the predominant bacteria in the elderly and highly resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic. The most effective drug against gram-negative bacteria was imipenem, while linezolid proved potently effective against gram-positive bacteria. Diabetes, previous antimicrobial use, and recurrent urinary infections are risk factors for polymicrobial UTIs.}

Nevertheless, as the network becomes deeper, it is easy to cause training over-fitting and performance saturation, particularly in the case of insufficient training data. In this paper, we report the design of a new network, namely parallel deraining convolutional neural network (PARDNet), for single-image deraining. Specifically, PARDNet adopts two parallel residual sub-networks based on different receptive fields to extract more comprehensive characteristics of the rain streaks, as well as decrease the depth of the network. The hybrid dilated convolution is employed to enlarge the sub-network’s receptive field to capture more context information. The efficient channel attention module is integrated into the proposed PARDNet to capture rain streaks more effectively and preserve more background details. Furthermore, to facilitate the network training, the residual learning is also fused into PARDNet in a holistic way. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PARDNet for single-image deraining.}

Technological advances over the past century have accelerated the pace and breadth of medical and surgical care. From the initial delivery of “telemedicine” over the radio in the 1920s, the delivery of medicine and surgery in the 21st century is no longer limited by connectivity. The COVID-19 pandemic hastened the uptake of telemedicine to ensure that health care can be maintained despite limited face-to-face contact. Like other areas of medicine, vascular surgery has adopted telemedicine, although its role is not well described in the literature. This narrative review explores how telemedicine has been delivered in vascular surgery. Specific themes of telemedicine are outlined with real-world examples, including consultation, triaging, collaboration, mentoring, monitoring and surveillance, mobile health, and education. This review also explores possible future advances in telemedicine and issues around equity of care. Finally, important ethical considerations and limitations related to the applications of telemedicine are outlined.}

Albumin is a relatively small molecule with a radius of 7.5 nm and a molecular weight of 65 kDa. It is the most abundant protein in plasma, accounting for 60–75% of its oncotic pressure. Its concentration in plasma is merely one static measurement reflecting a dynamic and complex system of albumin physiology, and is the net result of several different processes, one or more of which may become deranged by disease or its treatment. It is also unsurprising that hypoalbuminaemia has proved to be an indicator of morbidity and mortality risk since the underlying conditions which cause it, including protein energy malnutrition, crystalloid overload, inflammation, and liver dysfunction are themselves risk factors. In some cases, its underlying cause may require treatment but mostly it is just a parameter to be monitored and used as one measure of clinical progress or deterioration. While malnutrition, associated with a low protein intake, may be a contributory cause of hypoalbuminaemia, in the absence of inflammation and/or dilution with crystalloid its development in response to malnutrition alone is slow compared with the rapid change caused by inflammatory redistribution or dilution with crystalloids. Other significant causes include liver dysfunction and serous losses. These causal factors may occur singly or in combination in any particular case. Treatment is that of the underlying causes and associated conditions such as a low plasma volume, not of hypoalbuminaemia per se.}

The distinction between PDAC and chronic pancreatitis is sometimes challenging on routine histopathological examination, highlighting the need to identify biomarkers that can facilitate this distinction. This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic utility of nuclear receptor co-activator 3 (NCOA3), Maspin and Von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) immunostaining in PDAC. Eighty cases of PDAC, 46 cases of chronic pancreatitis and 53 normal pancreatic tissue were immunohistochemically assessed using NCOA3, Maspin and VHL antibodies on sections from a tissue microarray. NCOA3, Maspin and VHL were positive in 90 %, 100 % and 35 %, of PDAC cases respectively, whereas NCOA3, Maspin and VHL expressions were positive in 3.8 %, 0 and 100 % of normal pancreatic tissue and in 15.2 %, 21.7 % and 97.8 % of chronic pancreatitis cases respectively. Significant differences were observed between PDAC and other groups regarding NCOA3, Maspin and VHL expression (p < 0.001). The H scores of NCOA3, Maspin and VHL could significantly distinguish between PDAC and normal cases with high sensitivity (90 %, 100 % and 98.75 % respectively) and specificity (100 %, 100 % and 96.23 % respectively). Similar findings were found in the distinction between PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (Sensitivity: 90 %, 95.25 % and 98.75 %; specificity: 100 %, 100 % and 93.48 % for NCOA3, Maspin and VHL respectively). In conclusion, NCOA3 and Maspin were found to be significantly expressed in PDAC compared to non-tumorous tissue while VHL was significantly expressed in non-tumorous tissue. A panel of NCOA3, Maspin and VHL could potentially distinguish PDAC from non-tumorous pancreatic tissue.}

This conserved modification interacts with vital cellular pathways. Although O-GlcNAc is widely distributed throughout the body, it is particularly enriched in the brain, where most proteins are O-GlcNAcylated. Recent studies have established a causal link between O-GlcNAc regulation in the brain and alterations in neurophysiological function. Alterations in O-GlcNAc levels in the brain are associated with the pathogenesis of several neurogenic diseases that can lead to cognitive impairment. Remarkably, manipulation of O-GlcNAc levels demonstrated a protective effect on cognitive function. Although the precise molecular mechanism of O-GlcNAc modification in the nervous system remains elusive, its regulation is fundamental to multiple neural and cognitive functions, fluctuating levels during normal and pathological cognitive processes. In this review, we highlight the significant functional importance of O-GlcNAc modification in pathological cognitive impairments and the potential application of O-GlcNAc as a promising target for the intervention or amelioration of cognitive impairments.}

Mortality rates were standardized against the 2010 census population of China (ASMRC) and Segi's world population (ASMRW). Joinpoint regression models were used to analyze temporal trends. Our findings indicated an estimated 14,568 MM-related deaths in China. The observed crude mortality rates ASMRC, and ASMRW were 1.04, 0.80, and 0.62 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. A notable sex-related difference in mortality rates was evident, with male mortalities (8,319) surpassing female mortalities (6,249) by a factor of 1.33. Age-wise, mortality rates tended to increase after 55 years, reaching a maximum in those over 85 years (7.09 per 100,000 individuals). Provincial data revealed that the highest ASMRCs were in Zhejiang, Beijing, and Jiangxi, whereas the lowest were in Tibet, Qinghai, and Hainan. The period from 2013 to 2020 exhibited a significant increase of 58.09 % in MM mortality, with urban and rural areas exhibiting a 44.97 % and 70.94 % increase, respectively.

However, ChatGPT4 has yet to be challenged in obstetric anesthesia clinical decision-making. Study Objective: In this study, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT4 in the management of clinical labor analgesia scenarios compared to expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Intervention: Eight clinical questions with progressively increasing medical complexity were posed to ChatGPT4. Measurements: The ChatGPT4 responses were rated by seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists based on safety, accuracy and completeness of each response using a five-point Likert rating scale. Main Results: ChatGPT4 was deemed safe in 73% of responses to the presented obstetric anesthesia clinical scenarios (27% of responses were deemed unsafe). None of the ChatGPT4 responses were unanimously deemed to be safe by all seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Moreover, ChatGPT4 responses were overall partly accurate (score 4 out of 5) and somewhat incomplete (score 3.5 out of 5). Conclusions: In summary, approximately one quarter of all responses by ChatGPT4 were deemed unsafe by expert obstetric anesthesiologists. These findings may suggest the need for more fine-tuning and training of LLMs such as ChatGPT4 specifically for clinical decision making in obstetric anesthesia or other specialized medical fields. These LLMs may come to play an important future role in assisting obstetric anesthesiologists in clinical decision making and enhancing overall patient care.}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled development of natural language algorithms capable of generating coherent texts. We evaluated the quality, validity, and safety of this generative AI in preoperative anaesthetic planning.
Methods
In this exploratory, single-centre, convergent mixed-method study, 10 clinical vignettes were randomly selected, and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 4.0) was prompted to create anaesthetic plans, including cardiopulmonary risk assessment, intraoperative anaesthesia technique, and postoperative management. A quantitative assessment compared these plans with those made by eight senior anaesthesia consultants. A qualitative assessment was performed by an adjudication committee through focus group discussion and thematic analysis. Agreement on cardiopulmonary risk assessment was calculated using weighted Kappa, with descriptive data representation for other outcomes.
Results
ChatGPT anaesthetic plans showed variable agreement with consultants' plans. ChatGPT, the survey panel, and adjudication committee frequently disagreed on cardiopulmonary risk estimation. The ChatGPT answers were repetitive and lacked variety, evidenced by the strong preference for general anaesthesia and absence of locoregional techniques. It also showed inconsistent choices regarding airway management, postoperative analgesia, and medication use. While some differences were not deemed clinically significant, subpar postoperative pain management advice and failure to recommend tracheal intubation for patients at high risk for pulmonary aspiration were considered inappropriate recommendations.
Conclusions
Preoperative anaesthetic plans generated by ChatGPT did not consistently meet minimum clinical standards and were unlikely the result of clinical reasoning. Therefore, ChatGPT is currently not recommended for preoperative planning. Future large language models trained on anaesthesia-specific datasets might improve performance but should undergo vigorous evaluation before use in clinical practice.}

Methods
This comparative validation study, conducted between October 2023 and May 2024, utilized 202 thyroid ultrasound images sourced from 3 open-access databases. Both complete and cropped versions of each image were independently evaluated by expert radiologists to establish a reference standard for TI-RADS features and categories. GPT-4 and GPT-4o were prompted to analyze each image, and their generated TI-RADS outputs were compared to the reference standard.
Results
GPT-4 demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity when assessing complete thyroid ultrasound images across most TI-RADS categories, resulting in mixed overall accuracy. For low-risk nodules (benign), GPT-4 achieved 25.0% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, and 93.6% accuracy. In contrast, in the higher risk moderately suspicious category GPT-4 showed 75% sensitivity, 22.2% specificity, and 42.1% accuracy. While GPT-4 effectively identified features like smooth margins (73% vs 65% the reference standard), it struggled to identify other features like isoechoic echogenicity (5% vs 46%), and echogenic foci (3% vs 27%). The assessment of cropped images using both GPT-4 and GPT-4o followed similar patterns, though with slight deviations indicating a decrease in performance compared to GPT-4's assessment of complete images.
Conclusion
While GPT-4 and GPT-4o models show potential for improving the efficiency of thyroid nodule triage, their performance remains suboptimal, particularly in higher-risk categories. Further refinement and validation of these models are necessary before clinical implementation.}

As medical education increasingly incorporates digital methods such as video lectures, e-learning, and virtual meetings, it becomes crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual classrooms in teaching surgical techniques. This study aims to assess whether live virtual classrooms can effectively convey surgical skills to medical students.
Methods
First- and second-y medical students were randomized to in-person or live-video sessions once a week, for 2 wk. Students were taught how to perform simple interrupted sutures with instrument-tying. At the end of the workshop, participants were recorded performing simple interrupted sutures. Postinstruction skills videos, blinded to student group placement, were graded from 1 to 5 based on instrument handling, time, efficiency, tissue handling, wound closure, and overall technique.
Results
Out of 114 enrolled students, 42 completed the workshop. Notably, the virtual group had a significantly higher proportion of dropouts than the in-person group. Rubric scores showed no significant differences in various skill categories between the two groups. While both groups acknowledged the helpfulness of their respective methods, a majority expressed a preference for in-person instruction. The postcourse survey revealed that students valued in-person instruction for real-time feedback and multiple-angle demonstrations.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that video instruction may be equally effective in improving students' surgical technique compared to live sessions. However, it also highlights a clear personal preference among students for in-person instruction, emphasizing the value of a personalized, hands-on approach and enhanced visibility provided by in-person teaching methods.}

To examine the potential reliability and credibility of leveraging ChatGPT for argumentation feedback, the study conducted a retrospective analysis by applying ChatGPT to generate feedback on 50 sets of argumentation contents that human teachers had previously assessed. The study first assessed the feedback accuracy of ChatGPT and the factors that influenced the evaluation of arguments. The findings showed that ChatGPT demonstrated impressive precision rate (91.8 %) and recall rate (63.2 %) when providing feedback on arguments, indicating that ChatGPT possesses a fundamental capability to provide feedback on arguments. However, this capability of ChatGPT was significantly affected by the length of arguments and the discourse markers used in the arguments. The study then qualitatively compared the ChatGPT's feedback and teacher's feedback. The results revealed that these two types of feedback each had their own advantages and disadvantages. While ChatGPT could potentially generate comprehensive feedback and textual-based feedback, and limited to the linguistic level when provide affective feedback, teacher's feedback was more focused on student's overall learning progress, based on personal teaching experience to correctly identify immediate critical problem of the student, and consideration on the humanistic empathy interaction. Although the overall findings suggested that ChatGPT exhibited potential reliability and credibility for argumentation feedback, the study did identify several limitations.}

Methods
AAPI high school students (n = 31,071) participating in the 2019–2020 California Student Tobacco Survey were categorized by race/ethnicity and examined for ever and current (past-30-day) marijuana use. Descriptive statistics were used to describe marijuana use and harm perceptions by subgroups. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare subgroups on marijuana use with other demographics as covariates.
Results
Current marijuana use rates by ethnic subgroups were: Chinese 4.2 %, Koreans 4.9 %, Indians 5.2 %, Vietnamese 6.0 %, Hmong 6.4 %, Pakistanis 6.6 %, Japanese 9.4 %, Filipinos 9.6 %, Cambodians 17.9 %, other monoethnic Asians 10.5 %, and Pacific Islanders 22.3 %.

Disagreement persists regarding the cause of death in patients with tuberculosis (TB) between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics. This study investigated the disagreement and contributing factors between TB-related and non-TB-related deaths using an integrated national TB database in South Korea.
Methods
We identified a sub-set cohort of 29,033 patients with drug-susceptible TB registered between 2011 and 2020 who died during TB treatment. The cause of death was identified by the Korean National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (KNTSS) and Statistics Korea database. We performed a multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with the cause of death.
Results
The participants’ median age was 79 years (interquartile range, 70–85 years), with males comprising 63.2 %. Among the 29,033 deaths, 12,937 (44.6 %) and 6028 (20.8 %) were classified as TB-related deaths in Statistics Korea and KNTSS, respectively. The overall agreement rate for the cause of death between the two databases was 0.72 (95 % confidence interval, 0.71–0.72), increasing from 0.69 in 2011–0.77 in 2020. Among discrepant cases, 92.2 % (7545/8181) were classified as non-TB-related in KNTSS but as TB-related in Statistics Korea. Over the study period, the proportion of individuals classified as non-TB-related deaths in both databases and the agreement rate increased. In the multinomial analysis, age, sputum acid-fast bacilli smear, Charlson comorbidity index, and comorbidities, such as cancer and end-stage renal disease, showed distinguishing features across the cause of death groups.
Conclusions
Substantial disagreement on the cause of death persists between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics, though this decreased during the study period. Most disagreement likely indicates an underestimation of TB-related deaths in the TB registry. Age, sputum smear, and comorbidities were identifiable characteristics across groups that may influence the cause of death coding process.}

abstract = {Background
The lipomodeling technique has transformed the management of Poland syndrome-associated thoraco-mammary deformities. Complex type 3 cases with significant thoracic deformity often require a combined approach, including the latissimus dorsi flap, which is absent in about 10 % of cases. These patients face therapeutic challenges. The breast-pectoralis flap (BPF), developed for breast reconstruction, allows transfer of tissue from the contralateral breast. This study aimed to evaluate the BPF's contribution to correcting severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and associated syndromes.
Materials and methods
We conducted a case series on five female patients aged 11–16 years between 2012 and 2024 to evaluate outcomes and complications of breast reconstruction using the BPF. Four had severe stage III Poland syndrome with marked thoracic deformity. One had sequelae from cystic lymphangioma treatment, lacking the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major muscles, corresponding to severe stage III Poland syndrome. Evaluation criteria included aesthetic results, patient satisfaction, functional impact, and the number of lipomodeling sessions needed.
Results
The BPF enabled thoraco-mammary restoration in all patients. Additional lipomodeling sessions achieved the desired morphological results. All outcomes were “very good,” with no flap necrosis or other complications. Patient satisfaction was rated “very good” in all cases.
Conclusion
The BPF is a valuable technique for treating severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and should be part of the therapeutic arsenal for complex cases. However, it requires a delicate procedure by experienced plastic surgeons.}

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a keystone of the public health response to HIV, making the support of adherence a point of focus in research and service delivery. Over the past decade, measurements of viral suppression have increasingly been used to evaluate interventions, with more robust study designs gaining traction. Effective approaches include adherence counselling beyond ART education (including mental health and wellbeing approaches), reducing burden of care, tackling structural and societal determinants of health, and using mHealth platforms to deliver interventions. Increasingly, single-strategy interventions are giving way to multicomponent approaches to respond to nuances in adherence behaviour. However, determining which effective strategy to offer and to whom, when, and how remain pressing questions if professionals in the field (eg, researchers, clinicians, and community health workers) are to reach the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals in the recent context of decreased funding. As new long-acting treatments enter global formularies, interventions showing success with oral ART will probably remain relevant to inform service delivery in most contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, patient breathing can affect treatment accuracy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a bi-polar (BP) gated motion management strategy for SBRT and evaluate its feasibility geometrically and dosimetrically.
Methods
The BP strategy involved instructing patients to hold their breath briefly at the end of both inhalation (EI) and exhalation (EE), with radiation delivered only during these breath-holding periods. Eight volunteers were included to evaluate breathing stability, repeatability, and patient comfort. Additionally, 15 patients were retrospectively studied to evaluate the geometric and dosimetric efficiency of BP in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) modes. BP plans were compared with four common breathing strategies: free breathing (FB), gating at the end of inhalation (GI), gating at the end of exhalation (GE), and real-time tracking (RT).
Results
Volunteers could comfortably hold their breath for >3 minutes, demonstrating good stability and repeatability. Geometrically, the ratio of BP's internal target volume (ITV) to GI's ITV was the smallest at 0.65, compared to 1.89 for FB, 1.05 for GE, and 0.68 for RT. In the dosimetric evaluation of IMRT plans, the lung V20Gy ratio for BP to GI was the smallest at 0.89. Similar trends were observed for VMAT plans.
Conclusions
The BP strategy is a feasible option for lung SBRT, offering reduced treatment volumes and normal tissue toxicity, with a high duty cycle and less technical complexity than other RT-based methods.}

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent an emerging technology that challenges individual technology user acceptance. Whereas AVs promise several advantages, their success is conditioned on public trust. AVs impact not only those who use them but also those who share the environment with them, such as bicyclists. Empirical research has been characterized by several competing constructs aimed at explaining AV receptivity. In this article, we (1) review extant research on the receptivity of AVs, and (2) develop and validate a model of AV receptivity. A cross-sectional survey of 219 bicyclists showed empirical support for the model. The model can be a useful tool for the AV industry and policymakers in need of assessing the likelihood of success for a wider AV diffusion and help them understand intervention strategies to address populations that may be less inclined to accept the new technology on public roads. We offer several recommendations for future research on refining the measurement instrument and enhancing our understanding of AV and autonomous technology receptivity.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Magnetic controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have been proven to be effective in controlling early onset neuromuscular scoliosis but no study has evaluated the combination with a sacro-bi-iliac construct. The aim of our study is to report surgical management of early onset non-walkers neuromuscular scoliosis correction using MCGRs associated with a sacro-bi-iliac “T-construct” and its mid-term outcomes. Our hypothesis was that this set-up provided well correction of the pelvic obliquity and that this correction was maintained over time.
Methods
A retrospective single-center study was conducted including all consecutive neuromuscular early onset scoliosis who underwent spinopelvic fixation using “T-construct” with two MCGRS. Four millimeters lengthening was performed every 4 months during outpatient clinics sessions. All children had a low-dose biplanar stereoradiography in EOS-Chair at pre/postoperative phase, each outpatient clinic appointment and last follow-up.
Results
Eighteen patients were included and 17 analyzed at the last follow-up. The mean age at surgery was 9.5 (range from 5 to 12 years), the mean follow-up was 4,7 years (range from 2.5 to 6.6 years) and 8 patients had a Risser stage above four. The global complication rate was 35% (N = 6/17 patients) including three medical and three mechanical complications related to “T-construct”, while the reoperation rate was 18% (N = 2 patients for wound debridement and one for iterative pelvic fixation). Cobb angle and pelvic obliquity were significantly improved by surgery (mean correction was 33.2 ° (55%) and 11 ° (77%) respectively; p < 0.001). At the last follow-up, we noted a loss of frontal Cobb angle correction (p < 0.01) whereas we did not observe any significant loss of pelvic obliquity (p > 0.9).
Conclusions
Although the global complication rate was 35% (half of which are mechanical complications), the treatment combining pelvic T-construct and MCGRs provides satisfactory correction of pelvic obliquity correction, good maintenance in the medium term and may be a procedure to consider for the surgical treatment of early onset neuromuscular scoliosis.

Although conventional therapies remain central to cancer management, the potential of immunotherapy is increasingly recognized. Immune checkpoint therapy, a key strategy in tumor immunotherapy, has demonstrated significant efficacy against solid tumors. However, its clinical application is hindered by its limited response rate, necessitating efforts to optimize its effectiveness. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) - stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway in immune checkpoint therapy. Manganese (Mn), an essential trace element, regulates the activity of CD8+ T and NK cells by modulating the cGAS-STING pathway. Furthermore, the combination of Mn with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy has demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects. Mn also influences immunogenic cell death (ICD), further augmenting its potential as an adjunct to tumor immunotherapy. Despite a growing body of research on the role of Mn in modulating the cGAS-STING pathway and inducing ICD, comprehensive reviews that synthesize these findings and explore the potential of Mn in enhancing immune checkpoint therapy remain scarce. This review aimed to fill this gap by examining the immune mechanisms by which Mn enhances immune checkpoint therapy and its overall impact on tumor immunotherapy.}

abstract = {Objective
We evaluated the contributions of chronological age, comorbidity burden, and/or frailty in predicting 90-day readmission in patients undergoing degenerative scoliosis surgery.
Methods
Patients were identified through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator. Comorbidity was assessed using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to predict readmission using age, frailty, and/or ECI. Area under the curve (AUC) was compared using DeLong's test.
Results
A total of 8104 patients were identified. Readmission rate was 9.8%, with infection representing the most common cause (3.5%). Our first model utilized chronological age, ECI, and/or frailty as primary predictors. The combination of ECI + frailty + age performed best, but the inclusion of chronological age did not significantly improve performance compared to ECI + frailty alone (AUC 0.603 vs. 0.599, P = 0.290). A second model using only chronological age and frailty as primary predictors performed better, however the inclusion of chronological age worsened performance when compared to frailty alone (AUC 0.747 vs. 0.743, P = 0.043).
Conclusions
These data support frailty as a predictor of 90-day readmission within a nationally representative sample. Frailty alone performed better than combinations of ECI and age. Interestingly, the integration of chronological age did not dramatically improve the model's performance. Limitations include the use of a national registry and a single frailty index. This provides impetus to explore biological age, rather than chronological age, as a potential tool for surgical risk assessment.}

The association of telomere length (TL) and coronary heart disease (CHD) is still debated, and there is a lack of dose-response meta-analyses on this issue. The aim is therefore to integrate existing evidence on the association between TL and CHD risk and explore the dose-response relationship between them.
Data synthesis
PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies up to September 2024. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with data presented as RRs and 95 % CIs. Restricted cubic splines were used to assess linear and nonlinear associations. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. Fourteen articles (8 prospective cohort studies, 2 case-cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 2 cross-sectional studies) were finally included in the meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 199,562 participants and 25,752 cases. For CHD, the total RR for the highest TL group compared to the lowest TL group was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.61, 0.78, I2 = 64.5 %). For every 1 kilobase pair (kbp) increase in TL, the CHD risk decreased by 23 % (RR = 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.69, 0.87, I2 = 89.0 %). The nonlinearity test indicated a linear association between TL and CHD risk (Pnon-linearity = 0.930). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust.
Conclusions
The meta-analysis showed a linear relationship between TL and CHD. People with low TL may be more likely to develop CHD than those with high TL. The association between the two did not change in a wide range of populations.}

It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) patients not receiving anticoagulants are at higher risk of Ischemic Stroke (IS).
Objective
Our objective is to estimate how much the Medicare program spends during one-year treating a Medicare beneficiary (MB) with AF who were not being anticoagulated prior to or during their IS hospitalization.
Methods
This cross-sectional study population consisted of all MBs in the fee-for-service program who were discharged from a hospitalization for IS having AF during 2018. Patients were excluded for a prior history of stroke or already receiving long-term anticoagulants. Medicare spending was defined as paid claims during the index hospitalization and all facility claims that began within 12-months of the index hospital discharge date even if admission occurred in 2019.
Results
The final sample was 50,509 MBs. Average Medicare Part A spending per beneficiary was $46,867 ± $49,212, for a total of nearly $2.5 billion. Highest average spending per MB was for hospital services $25,848, of which $15,790 ± $20,984 occurred during the index hospitalization, and $10,058 ± $21,956 for rehospitalization. The Medicare program average MB spending included $8131 ± $14,979 at skilled nursing facilities, $5538 ± $12,739 at rehabilitation facilities, and $3056 ± $7495 for outpatient facilities or emergency departments.
Conclusion
MBs with AF who are not treated with anticoagulants and then suffer an ischemic stroke result in one-year Medicare Part A program spending of approximately $47,000 per person compared to an average spending of approximately $12,800 per beneficiary in the Medicare program in 2018 [1]. Identification and anticoagulation treatment in AF could result in significant healthcare savings.}

abstract = {Background
Myelomeningocele (MMC) disproportionately affects low-resource areas and regions without mandatory folic acid fortification. No specific literature exists on the distribution of research output regarding neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele worldwide in relation to regional disease burden. We aimed to examine the country of origin and patient population of published papers on MMC and topics related to neurosurgical management of MMC, to determine whether these were proportionate to disease burden.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted on neurosurgical aspects of MMC care. The geographic distribution of neurosurgical MMC research output was examined against the national burden of disease. Bibliometric analysis quantified author and patient country affiliations stratified by World Bank income group classification and folic acid fortification status, juxtaposed with disease burden.
Results
From 9692 titles, 1843 were included, representing 107,446 patients and 2650 authorship instances. High-income countries (HICs) constituted 3% of 2019's global neural tube defect (NTD) births, 74% of authorships, and 83% of patients represented. Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) represented 9% of NTD births, 16% of authorships, and 9% of published patients. Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) represented 55% of NTD births but only 8.6% of authorships and 7% of patients. Low-income countries (LICs) shouldered 32% of NTD births and contributed 1.3% of authorships and 1.6% of patients. Countries with mandatory folic acid fortification represented 75% of patients and 54% of authorships. Postnatal repair, hydrocephalus, and postoperative complications were the most frequently studied topics.
Conclusions
The global literature concerning neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele originates predominantly from HICs. Published experiences of myelomeningocele patients from LICs/LMICs are scarce, even though they constitute the majority of the affected population. Neurosurgeons and other health professionals must address this mismatch between disease burden and publication volume in order to inform practice, policy, and advocacy for MMC care worldwide.}

abstract = {Background
Glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, has garnered attention as a substrate for sustainable bioprocessing. This study investigates the metabolic adaptability of a newly isolated strain, Klebsiella variicola JYP01, focusing on glycerol utilization under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the potential of this strain as a proficient producer of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) in sustainable bioprocessing. The research explores the potential of K. variicola JYP01 as the efficient PDO producers with the emphasis on the integration of zero-valent iron (ZVI) to enhance energy production and PDO yield.
Methods
Isolation and characterization of the JYP01 strain, assessing its growth and PDO production under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and incorporating ZVI (as an electron donor) to identify the metabolic fluxes. Several analyses, including 16S rRNA analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and bio-electrochemical system reactors, were employed to elucidate metabolic strategies and the bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to PDO of JYP01 particularly with ZVI.
Significant findings
The integration of ZVI into the bioconversion process significantly enhanced PDO production, leading to 171 % increase from 44.0 mM to 75.2 mM. This demonstrates the distinct ability of the K. variicola JYP01 strain to utilize ZVI as an extra reducing energy in an anaerobic environment. The findings underscore this strain's metabolic capacity, its suitability for glycerol conversion on a large scale, and the novel strategy of using ZVI to elevate PDO production, advancing sustainable bioprocessing techniques.}

abstract = {Liver failure, either acute (ALF) or acute-on-chronic (ACLF), is characterized by hepatocellular dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure, leading to high mortality without liver transplantation (LT). However, LT is limited by organ shortages and medical contraindications, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. Biological liver support systems, incorporate functional hepatocytes to partially restore hepatic metabolic functions, though clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Artificial systems, such as albumin dialysis (MARS, Prometheus), facilitate toxin removal, though evidence remains limited. Continuous renal replacement therapy, while not specific for liver failure, is essential in patients with severe hyperammonemia or acute kidney injury, aiding in ammonia clearance and fluid balance control. Plasma exchange (PE) has promising detoxification and immunomodulatory effects, improving survival in ALF. In ACLF, PE may reduce systemic inflammation, though evidence remains limited. Further studies are needed to optimize ECLS therapies, refine patient selection, and establish their role in ALF and ACLF management.
Resumen
La insuficiencia hepática, ya sea aguda (IHA) o aguda sobre crónica (ACLF), se caracteriza por disfunción hepatocelular, inflamación sistémica y fallo multiorgánico, con una alta mortalidad en ausencia de trasplante hepático (TH). Sin embargo, el TH está limitado por la escasez de órganos y contraindicaciones médicas, lo que ha motivado el desarrollo de terapias de soporte extracorpóreo. Los sistemas de soporte hepático biológico, diseñados para restaurar funciones metabólicas mediante hepatocitos funcionales, no se utilizan actualmente en la práctica clínica. Entre los sistemas artificiales, técnicas como MARS y Prometheus permiten la eliminación de toxinas unidas a albúmina, aunque su uso ha disminuido y no han demostrado beneficio en la supervivencia. La terapia de reemplazo renal continua es útil en pacientes con hiperamoniemia o lesión renal aguda. El intercambio plasmático ha demostrado beneficios en la IHA y podría tener un rol en el ACLF. Se requieren estudios para definir su papel clínico.}

However, the false positive/negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical experiments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI-generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles’ abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI-generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval. However, it is vital to address the concerns regarding false detection of AI generated text and ensure that these models are used in ethical and responsible conduct.}

Furthermore, the crystal exhibited a long-time relaxation behavior at 4 K. The freezing temperature increases with frequency increasing. Additionally, we explored the response of the crystal to DC magnetization and AC susceptibility under different pressure conditions, up to 1.58 GPa. The crystal exhibits three anomalies TC = 22.0 K, T1 = 20.5 K and TN = 11.0 K under ambient pressure. An analysis of the anisotropy of the spin-glass-like behavior in the crystal was conducted, with a specific focus on the a-axis as the preferred direction of magnetization.

In brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI), children with upper trunk injuries have multidirectional movement deficits, including global abduction and hand-to-neck, hand-to-abdomen, and hand-to-spine movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of pericoracoid tissue release and postoperative structured physiotherapy as a first-step intervention to reduce the multidirectional movement deficit in children with BPBI.
Methods
Thirty-four children with BPBI underwent pericoracoid tissue release, including coracohumeral and coracoacromial ligament release, pectoralis minor release, and coracoid process osteotomy. Patients were followed up with regular physiotherapy and a home exercise program for 1 year after surgery. Before surgery and at 3 and 12 months after surgery, upper-extremity function was measured using the modified Mallet classification and Active Movement Scale, passive shoulder and elbow joint movements were measured using goniometry, and the difference in the distance between the treatment table and the acromion was measured.
Results
There was an improvement in all movement tasks evaluated with modified Mallet classification, and there was increased shoulder flexion, abduction, and external and internal rotation movements as evaluated with Active Movement Scale. Increased passive joint movements were noted in abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation movements with the arm next to the body and with the limb in 90° abduction. There was a decrease in the distance difference between the acromion and the treatment table between both sides.
Conclusions
Pericoracoid tissue release provided multidirectional improvement in shoulder joint movements in children with BPBI.

Furthermore, the relationship between the viscosity of the slurry and the solubility parameters (SPs) of the silica particles and acrylic monomers was investigated. When the SPs of the silica particles and acrylic monomers were close, the viscosity of the silica slurry decreased and high concentrations of the silica particles could be dispersed in the acrylic monomers. Therefore, SP can be used for predicting the dispersibility of silica particles. The prepared slurry was then used to fabricate sintered silica glass. Silica slurry was cured through photopolymerization to obtain a green body, which was then heat-treated at 850 °C in air atmosphere and sintered at 1710 °C under vacuum to obtain sintered silica glass. Transparent sintered silica glass with no cracks was obtained using 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate, which has a similar SP to that of silica particles, as a solvent. The obtained sintered silica glass exhibited a transmittance of 92 % at a wavelength of 400 nm. In the ultraviolet region, light absorption originated from two-coordinated Si in the glass. The absorption spectrum in the infrared region showed an extremely low peak of the SiOH group, indicating that low-OH silica glass was obtained. Thus, this study provides a new method for fabricating silica glass and provides a method of selecting solvents for the slurries used in powder sintering.}

abstract = {Objectives
The nature of paramedic workflows, where paramedics are responsible to provide care and chart concurrently, can result in incomplete or non-existent patient care reports on patient handover to the emergency department (ED). Charting delays and retrospective recollection of care may lead to patient information gaps, which can increase ED workload, cause care delays, and increase the risk of adverse events. Speech recognition documentation technology has the potential to produce complete patient care reports quicker and improve paramedic-to-ED handover. We performed a scoping review to determine paramedic perceptions and user requirements for speech recognition documentation technology.
Methods
MEDLINE, Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, ProQuest, and CINAHL were searched from 2014 to March 2024. Criteria included studies focused on paramedics’ use or perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology. This review included studies conducted in the prehospital environment and adjacent agencies (i.e., ED, fire, police, military).
Results
The review identified eight articles that met inclusion criteria. All eight articles were small focus group-based studies in laboratory settings published on or after 2020. Five studies were conducted in the United States, two in Switzerland, and one in Japan. Of the eight studies, five recommended further live environment testing of the technology examined, and three underscored the importance of a user-centred design. The top user requirements for speech recognition adoption was hands-free use, noise reduction technology, battery life, and word accuracy. All eight studies recommended further research and development of speech recognition documentation technology in the prehospital workflow.
Conclusion
This scoping review has highlighted that while there is a growing interest in speech recognition documentation technology in the paramedicine workflow, more research is needed, especially with larger samples in a live environment. The user requirements and perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology in paramedicine must be better understood to design systems with high adoption rates.}

abstract = {Objective
This review is prepared to formulate the most current, evidence-based recommendations regarding the incidence, epidemiology, classification and radiological features of primary vertebral tumors.
Materials and methods
A systematic literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL was performed from 2013 to 2023 using the search terms “primary vertebral tumors”, “incidence”, “epidemiology”, “classification,” and “radiological diagnosis”. Screening criteria resulted in 6, 5, and 34 studies respectively that were analyzed regarding incidence, epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and radiographic diagnosis of primary vertebral tumors. Using the Delphi method and two rounds of voting at two separate international meetings, ten members of the WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee generated nine final consensus statements.
Results
Primary tumors of the vertebral column are relatively rare, with an overall prevalence of 2.5 to 8.5 cases per 100,000 persons per year. In adults, hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the spine, other common benign tumors in adults include osteoblastomas and osteochondromas. The most common malignant primary spinal neoplasm in adults is plasmocytoma (30 %) and other malignant tumors in adults include chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Chordoma represents about 2–4 % of all spinal column tumors, 40 % of primary spinal tumors and has a high propensity for the sacral and cervical regions. Incidence of primary malignant vertrebral tumors is correlated with patient’s age. The risk increased significantly when patients were older than 40 years. CT and MRI are both required for proper diagnosis, with correlation of findings to age and clinical presentation. Biopsy can identify tumors and accurately determine the type, grade, and stage of tumors. Complication rates for percutaneous biopsy range between 1 and 3 %, compared to 16 % for open biopsy. Lower accuracy rates have also been reported in fibrotic, collagenous, and inflammatory lesions, as well as for specific lesions such as aneurysmal bone cysts and hemangiomas. Osteolytic or mixed lesions have a reported diagnostic yield of up to 88 %, compared with sclerotic lesions at 67 %.
Conclusions
Final nine consensus statements provide current, evidence-based guidelines on the incidence, epidemiology, classification and radiographic diagnosis of primary vertebral tumors for practicing spine surgeons worldwide.}

To evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of three Artificial intelligence (AI) models—GPT-4o, Canva-GPT, and ECG Reader-GPT—against emergency medicine specialists (EMSs) in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation using a standardized and validated test set.
Methods
In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, 50 ECG questions were selected from the reference text 150 ECG Cases. Thirty EMSs completed the test once; each AI model was evaluated on the same test set daily over 30 consecutive days. Diagnostic accuracy was compared across predefined ECG subcategories and clinical case types.
Results
EMSs achieved the highest overall diagnostic accuracy (median: 41.5; IQR: 37.0–43.0), followed closely by ECG Reader-GPT (median: 39.5; IQR: 39.0–41.0), with no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0.530). ECG Reader-GPT significantly outperformed both GPT-4o and Canva-GPT across all case categories (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ECG Reader-GPT performed comparably to EMSs in identifying ischemic syndromes, channelopathies and genetic syndromes, and normal ECGs (all p < 0.05); it surpassed them in interpreting rhythm disorders (p = 0.007).
Conclusion
ECG Reader-GPT, a customized AI model for ECG interpretation, demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to experienced EMSs and significantly outperformed general-purpose models across all ECG subcategories. These findings highlight the value of domain specialization in developing clinically effective AI tools.}

abstract = {Background
Treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) differs based on MI type, which can be difficult to determine in the emergency department. This study sought to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm (MI3) in combination with N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) can accurately differentiate MI type.
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of the multisite CMR-IMPACT trial, which prospectively enrolled adults with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and an initial indeterminate troponin. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of MI and an initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI; Abbott Laboratories) measure were included. Incidence of MI and MI type were adjudicated by expert reviewers. Receiver operator characteristic curves for MI-type were created and area under the curve (AUC) calculated for MI3 and MI3 with NT-proBNP and Gal-3. AUCs were compared using DeLong’s method.
Results
Among 123 patients with adjudicated MI, the mean age was 60±12 years and 37.4% (46/123) were female. Type 1 MI occurred in 58.5% (72/123) and type 2 MI in 41.5% (51/123). MI3 based on an initial hs-cTnI yielded an AUC of 0.704 (95% CI 0.611-0.797) for MI type. When combined with NT-proBNP and Gal-3, AUC improved to 0.789 (95% CI 0.709-0.869, p=0.0165). In patients with serial hs-cTnIs (n = 86), the AUC of MI3 for MI type was 0.721 (95% CI 0.614-0.829) and increased to 0.797 (95% CI 0.700-0.894, p=0.09) with the addition of NT-proBNP and Gal-3.
Conclusion

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions (LIs) are the cornerstone for obesity management. The Mayo Clinic Diet (MCD) offers two approaches for LIs: the In-Person LI (IPLI) and the Digital Enhanced LI (DELI). The IPLI includes a 2-day in-person program with monthly follow-ups, whereas the DELI provides on-demand digital tools. The comparative efficacy of these approaches is currently unknown.
Methods
This retrospective study included two cohorts of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2 and weight metrics at least 3 months after starting either the IPLI or DELI program. The primary endpoint was the total body weight loss percentage (TBWL%) at 6 months.
Results
The study included 133 participants in the IPLI cohort (mean age 46.3 years, 65.4 % female, BMI 36.4) and 9603 in the DELI cohort (mean age 60.1 years, 85.0 % female, BMI 33.1). The DELI group achieved superior TBWL% at 1, 3, and 6 months compared to the IPLI group (3.4 % vs. 1.5 %, 4.7 % vs. 2.4 %, 5.3 % vs. 2.9 %, respectively; p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and starting weight, the DELI group maintained a higher TBWL% (difference 2.0 %; 95 % CI [1.0, 3.0], p < 0.001) and a greater proportion of participants achieved >5 % TBWL at 6 months (OR 1.66; 95 % CI [1.08, 2.55], p < 0.023).
Conclusion
The DELI approach resulted in superior weight loss outcomes compared to the IPLI. Further research is needed to explore how digital tools can improve weight loss effectiveness.}

abstract = {Introduction
Patient Engagement Platforms, particularly chat functionalities, potentially improve communication but may also heighten workload, contributing to burnout among healthcare professionals. Natural Language Processing advancements, like ChatGPT and Med-PaLM, offer human-like responses to various questions, but concerns about their use in healthcare remain. This study evaluates whether Large Language Models can respond to patient questions as well as support staff in terms of quality and empathy.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 111 patient questions on lower limb arthroplasty, answered by support staff via an app, were selected. These questions were put into ChatGPT 3.5 to generate responses, and were collected on July 2 and 3, 2024. Two blinded healthcare professionals, an orthopaedic surgeon and an anesthetist, evaluated both the responses generated by ChatGPT and support staff, on quality, empathy, and risk of potential adverse events, selecting their preferred responses and identifying what they thought was ChatGPT’s response. A Patient Panel (n = 29) also assessed responses on empathy, preference, and source of the responses.
Results
Fifty questions were available for a comparative analysis between ChatGPT and support staff responses. No quality difference was found (p = 0.075) between ChatGPT and support staff, though ChatGPT was rated as more empathetic (p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two responses in the risk of incorrect treatment (p = 0.377). Physicians identified ChatGPT’s responses in 84–90 % of cases. The Patient Panel found ChatGPT to be more empathetic (p < 0.001) but showed no preference for ChatGPT (p = 0.086). Patients accurately identified ChatGPT’s responses in 34.5 % of cases (p = 0.005). Three ChatGPT responses showed high-risk errors.
Conclusion
This study shows ChatGPT generated high quality and empathetic responses to patient questions about lower limb arthroplasty. Further investigation is needed to optimize clinical use, but high appreciation for ChatGPT responses highlights the potential for use in clinical practice in the near future.}

In pharmacy research, LLMs have demonstrated potential utility, though challenges regarding response reproducibility, inconsistent accuracy, and information privacy persist. While LLMs can generate functional code, the usefulness of this capability for pharmacists remains underexplored. This commentary presents a practical example of how a pharmacist, drawing on digital competency, engaged with ChatGPT to create tools that support specific practice tasks, by requesting code. These include a calculator for pharmacokinetic parameters, volume and weight-based calculators, drug-drug interaction checks from a custom data table, and a hyperlink webpage tool to support multilingual translation of consumer medicines information documents. The tools were created through iterative prompting and are presented as functional prototypes, each of which passed a pilot functionality test. This commentary encourages pharmacists to enhance their digital competence to explore practice-relevant innovation through engagement with generative AI. It also highlights the value clinicians may gain through initiating such explorations as a foundation for potential collaboration with technology experts. Finally, the commentary discusses regulatory considerations related to pharmacists’ tool creation using AI, including issues on information privacy and task responsibility. Clinicians who actively leverage their digital competency to engage with AI may contribute to shaping the future of digital support tools within pharmacy practice while advancing their professional roles in the evolving landscape of healthcare technology.}

There have been 70 human cases of H5N1 influenza in the United States since April 2024 and, as shown in recent studies, our current antibody defenses are waning. Thus, it is imperative to discover new therapeutics in the fight against more recent strains of the virus. In this study, we present the Frankies framework for automated antibody diffusion and assessment. This pipeline was used to automate the generation of 30 novel anti-HA1 Fv antibody fragment sequences, fold them into 3-dimensional structures, and then dock against a recent H5N1 HA1 antigen structure for binding evaluation. Here we show the utility of artificial intelligence in the discovery of novel antibodies against specific H5N1 strains of interest, which bind similarly to known therapeutic and elicited antibodies.}

abstract = {Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by high relapse and mortality rates. Our previous investigation identified enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 3 (ECHDC3) as being of prognostic significance in AML; however, the underlying pathways remain elusive. The intricate crosstalk among genetic abnormalities, metabolic pathways, and protein dysfunctions underpins the complexity contributing to its poor prognosis.
Methods
ECHDC3 was knocked down by siRNA and subjected to RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and metabolomic assessments. Cell culture media were subjected to metabolomic assessments to evaluate changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Mass spectrometry was conducted on bone marrow leukemia stem cells (CD34+) from chemotherapy-sensitive (S) and chemotherapy-resistant (R) patients. Additionally, untargeted metabolomic sequencing was performed on bone marrow supernatants from this patient cohort, and a combined proteomic-metabolomic analysis was conducted on the sequencing results from paired samples.
Results
Knockdown of ECHDC3 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.0001), increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number MT-CO1 (p = 0.0367) and MT-CO2 (p = 0.0081), and enhanced manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity (p = 0.0003). Significant differences were observed in choline metabolism in cancer (p = 0.0063), linoleic acid (p = 0.0160), and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism (p = 0.0250) between the R and S groups. Furthermore, correlation analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data suggested that choline and glycerophospholipid metabolism may play pivotal roles in the development of chemotherapy resistance in AML.
Conclusions
ECHDC3 contributes to chemotherapy resistance in AML by regulating mitochondrial function, autophagy, and metabolic pathways. This study highlights ECHDC3 as a potential therapeutic target and offers insights into the development of AML treatments to overcome drug resistance.}

abstract = {Objective
We tested the potential of circulating galectin-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) levels at baseline in individuals with knee pain as biomarkers for development of radiographic knee and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA).
Design
This study comprised 212 individuals with knee pain from the Halland osteoarthritis cohort (HALLOA). Clinical characteristics and serum/plasma levels of galectin-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha were measured at baseline, and knee and hand radiographs were obtained at a two-year follow-up. The predictive value of circulating inflammatory markers and clinical variables at baseline was assessed using multinominal logistic regression for those who developed radiographic OA in knees only (n ​= ​25), in hands only (n ​= ​40), and in both knees and hands (n ​= ​43); the group who did not develop OA (n ​= ​104) was used as reference. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
Results
As expected, age was identified as a risk factor for having radiographic knee and/or hand OA at the two-year follow-up. Baseline circulating galectin-1 levels did not associate with developing radiographic knee OA but associated with developing radiographic hand OA (odds ratio (OR) for a 20% increased risk: 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.29) and both radiographic knee and hand OA (OR for a 20% increased risk: 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.30). However, baseline IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha did not associate with developing radiographic knee and/or hand OA.
Conclusion
Non-age adjusted circulating galectin-1 is superior to IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha in predicting radiographic hand but not knee OA.}

abstract = {Background
Neuromyths are prevalent in counseling and counselor education, potentially promoting harmful, unproven methods. This study examines the factors that predict the prevalence of neuromyths among counselors.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 415 participants, including counselors-in-training, practitioners, educators, and supervisors. The survey measured neuromyth endorsement using a 15-item questionnaire and assessed demographic characteristics, neuroscience knowledge, and the use of nine information sources. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of neuromyths.
Results
Predictors accounted for 9.0% of the variation in neuromyths (F = 4.775, p < .001). Counselors with higher educational levels endorsed fewer neuromyths compared to those with bachelor’s degrees. The use of books was associated with fewer neuromyths (β = .144, p < .01), whereas reliance on TV predicted higher neuromyth endorsement (β = -.187, p < .001).
Conclusion
Promoting accurate neuroscience knowledge through credible sources can reduce neuromyths in the counseling profession.}
