abstract = {Providing effective writing feedback to students could promote students' writing development. However, offering high-quality feedback remains a significant challenge for pre-service teachers (PSTs). Recent advancements in GenAI technology may offer solutions to this issue. The study examines the influence of a short-term teaching intervention on the feedback levels and feedback types of PSTs' ChatGPT-assisted feedback on students' written compositions, utilizing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design with 30 PSTs. The quantitative results revealed significant improvements in both feedback levels (i.e., higher-level feedback issues including ideas and elaboration and style) and feedback types (e.g., explanations and general suggestions). Additionally, the findings highlighted specific strategies employed by PSTs when considering levels and types in combination. Subsequent interviews identified the underlying influential factors of these improvements, namely the improvements in ChatGPT usage skills (i.e., prompt engineering and source use) and a deeper understanding of the feedback process (i.e., introspection). By demonstrating how short-term teaching interventions can leverage PST's ability to use GenAI tools to provide writing feedback, this research advances the theoretical understanding of human-AI collaboration in the context of writing and provides pedagogical insights for teacher training programs.}

To address this need, Human Digital Twins (HDT) have gained notoriety in which human-related data is collected to feed other methodologies such as Lean manufacturing or cognitive deloading approaches. Together with concerns regarding data privacy and regulatory compliance, this imposes a formidable challenge. This work introduces a foundational HDT component designed to facilitate the human digital twinning process. With only a single camera and heavily relying on edge computing, this system uses deep learning image processing algorithms deployed on a Google Coral Dev Board, ensuring user anonymity and privacy while delivering near real-time performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of this cost-efficient solution, experiments were conducted in an industrial laboratory setting to assess its functionality as a navigation support system for warehouse picking. To the authors’ knowledge, no prior studies have utilized a single-camera depth-perception setup for human pose estimation in this context. The system achieved strong performance, estimating the third dimension of human pose keypoints with an absolute error below 0.11 meters and classifying tasks with 94% accuracy across diverse picking sequences and subjects.}

This paper focuses on hot work and proposes an integrated risk management framework that combines computer vision (CV), optical character recognition (OCR), and ontology to monitor unsafe conditions of workers and provide emergency measures. The ontology knowledge base and rule set are developed from existing regulations and accident analyses, providing a structured foundation for risk assessment. To address challenges such as variable lighting and small object detection in hot work scenarios, the proposed ATFL-YOLO model achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.7 %. In addition, PaddleOCR is used to identify area labels, linking operational hazards with contextual text data and bridging the “logic gap” between intelligent risk assessment and emergency response. The framework can initiate emergency measures within an average of 12.3 s across diverse conditions, enhancing autonomous human–machine collaboration and delivering a reliable approach to safety management and emergency decision-making in Industry 4.0.}

The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with a learning algorithm called error backpropagation, always considered biologically implausible. To this end, recent works have studied learning algorithms for deep neural networks inspired by the neurosciences. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: it can model information processing in different areas of the brain, can be used in control and robotics, has a solid mathematical foundation in variational inference, and performs its computations asynchronously. Inspired by such properties, works that propose novel PC-like algorithms are starting to be present in multiple sub-fields of machine learning and AI at large. Here, we survey such efforts by first providing a broad overview of the history of PC to provide common ground for the understanding of the recent developments, then by describing current efforts and results, and concluding with a large discussion of possible implications and ways forward.}

The writing experiments in this study considered how to effectively and ethically work with generative AI to produce culturally appropriate EFL teaching materials. The experiments involved co-producing moral dilemmatic stories with ChatGPT to support a new Chinese EFL curriculum unit on “Morals and Virtues”. We draw on Lo's (2023a, 2023b) CLEAR framework for prompt engineering to generate appropriate stimulus materials. We refer to Durkheim's (1961) sociological theory on morality and Bernstein's (1971, 1981, 2003) concept of framing to unpack how moral decisions might be framed as dilemmas in particular sociocultural contexts. We then mobilize Martin and White's (2005) appraisal framework to uncover the patterns of cultural biases embedded in the AI-generated text. We propose a two-step “Navigation and Generation” method for effective prompt engineering with generative AI: first navigating the AI chatbot to a clear and consistent positioning around a concept, and then requesting the AI chatbot to generate text based on the clarifications generated in the first step. Our appraisal analysis indicates that WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) cultural values are embedded in moral dilemmatic stories generated by ChatGPT. EFL Teachers need to be aware of how these values are presented to encourage critical cultural awareness in their students.}

To gain a better understanding of the underlying atmospheric processes of torrential Meiyu rainfall, we investigated the moisture sources and isotopic composition of the 2020 extraordinary and persistent Meiyu rainfall in the Yangtze River valley from June 19 to July 10 using an isotopic regional spectral model. During the Meiyu period, significant amounts of Indian Ocean moisture were transported to Yangtze River valley by Indian monsoonal southwesterlies, especially in the middle levels between 850 hPa and 600 hPa. Whereas moderate amounts of East Asian continent moisture were distributed principally within the boundary layer below 850 hPa. Besides, tiny amounts of South China Sea moisture were transported by the western Pacific subtropical high to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River valley within the boundary layer below 900 hPa. With respect to isotopic characteristics, the lowest δ2H and the highest d-excess values of the Indian Ocean moisture were attributable to more rainout and below-cloud evaporation during long-distance transport. In contrast, the isotopic signals of the East Asian continent moisture and the South China Sea moisture were relatively preserved. The 2020 Meiyu rainfall exhibited significant intraseasonal variability and was classified into heavy and light Meiyu periods based on rainfall amount. Heavy Meiyu rainfall with northward migration were characterized by enhanced Indian Ocean moisture with lower δ2H and higher d-excess, resulting from the westward expansion of the western Pacific subtropical high and the deepened East Asian mid-latitude trough.}

abstract = {Restaurants are swiftly embracing automation to prepare food, experimenting with innovations from robotic arms for frying foods to pizza-making robots. While these advances promise to enhance efficiency and productivity, their impact on consumer psychology remains largely unexplored. We present four experiments that demonstrate how food service automation leads to negative downstream effects (i.e., diminished taste perceptions, decreased willingness to pay, less favorable attitudes towards food items) across multiple food categories. This stems in part from two distinct contagion effects, whereby automation appears to undermine the food's ability to contain symbolic love (positive contagion from human contact) while simultaneously increasing feelings of disgust (negative contagion from machine contact). Moreover, we highlight how communicating the consumer-oriented benefits of automation can suppress the disgust associated with automation and subsequently mitigate the deleterious effects on consumer evaluations. Our findings suggest that service retailers should consider the psychological impact on consumers when shifting away from human involvement in a category as intimate and consequential as the production of our food.}

Thirty-seven participants from three faculties participated in 14 individual interviews and seven focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis protocols. Encountered challenges were grouped into epistemological, ontological, and practical dimensions. Findings indicate that students drew upon various sources for inquiry and monitoring at the stages of planning and preparation, revising before submission, and reacting after getting results. Implications include the importance of creating low-threshold opportunities for facilitating learners’ feedback seeking. Findings also suggest that educators’ enhanced understanding of students' educational identity and epistemological beliefs may improve students’ feedback-seeking practices.}

abstract = {Background
Approximately 39% of young people (aged 16-24 y) experience mental ill health, but only 23% seek professional help. Early intervention is essential for reducing the impacts of mental illness, but young people, particularly those from culturally diverse communities, report experiencing shame and stigma, which can deter them from engaging with face-to-face services. Digital mental health (DMH) tools promise to increase access, but there is a lack of literature exploring the suitability of DMH tools for culturally diverse populations.
Objective
The project was conducted in partnership with a large-scale national DMH organization that promotes evidence-based early intervention, treatment, and support of mental health in young people and their families. The organization wanted to develop a self-directed web-based platform for parents and young people that integrates psychological assessments and intervention pathways via a web-based “check-in” tool. Our project explored the views of culturally diverse parents and young people on the opportunities and barriers to engagement with a web-based DMH screening tool.
Methods
We conducted a 2-phase qualitative study aiming to identify potential issues faced by culturally diverse communities when engaging with DMH tools designed for the Australian public. We worked with 18 culturally diverse participants (parents: n=8, 44%; young people: n=10, 56%) in a series of design-led workshops drawing on methods from speculative design and user experience to understand the opportunities and barriers that organizations might face when implementing population-level DMH tools with culturally diverse communities. NVivo was used to conduct thematic analyses of the audio-recorded and transcribed workshop data.
Results
Five themes were constructed from the workshops: (1) trust in the use and application of a DMH tool, (2) data management and sharing, (3) sociocultural influences on mental health, (4) generational differences in mental health and digital literacy, and (5) stigma and culturally based discrimination in mental health support.
Conclusions
The emergent themes have important considerations for researchers wishing to develop more inclusive DMH tools. The study found that healthy parent-child relationships will increase engagement in mental health support for young persons from culturally diverse backgrounds. Barriers to engagement with DMH tools included culturally based discrimination, the influence of culture on mental health support, and the potential impact of a diagnostic label on help seeking. The study’s findings suggest a need for culturally safe psychoeducation for culturally diverse end users that fosters self-determination with tailored resources. They also highlight important key challenges when working with culturally diverse populations.}

In this speculative essay, we demonstrate that the process of representation at work in architectural design originates from the designer's consciousness natural cognitive ability, rather than from the use of a specific mediation tool between the designer and his environment, between the mentally constructed architectural project and its representation. The effects of any tool of representation—analog or digital—on our perceptual apparatus depend primarily on the cognitive mechanisms affecting the discontinuous flow of internal representations formed by our consciousness. In other words, we propose to shed a new light on these limitations through the heuristic modeling of an architectural project designer confronted with his own cognitive biases, and the limits of the representation processes. In the present essay, the discontinuities and uncertainties inherent to the processes of representation are reintegrate in the models.}

However, ASAS systems on such basis have seen limited adoption in authentic teaching environments due to the models’ inability to explain the predictions they generate. To address this, we recruited 32 human graders to comparatively analyse the decision-making processes of human graders and AI-driven graders. Specifically, we exploited two types of data to holistically unveil the decision-making processes of human graders throughout grading, namely manual annotation of important words and gaze data of the human graders. The decision-making processes of AI-driven graders were revealed by important words extracted though eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique and grading confidence reflected by the prediction probability distributions. We measured the alignment in their decision-making regarding their (i) estimated scoring difficulty, (ii) important text segments and (iii) crucial grammatical categories to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven graders. Subsequently, we conducted randomised control studies, presenting machine-extracted insights like important words and estimated scoring difficulty to scrutinise how they affected human grading. Our findings contribute new knowledge regarding the consistency between human and machine scoring and validates machine-extracted insights, such as important words and scoring difficulty, to be valuable in facilitating human grading, encouraging the adoption of ASAS systems and urging the potential collaboration between machine and human grading in pedagogical practices. However, we emphasised the significance of grasping question context and intricacy before leveraging such machine-extracted insights.}

The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) systematic safety analysis table encapsulates the collective wisdom of experts. While knowledge graph technology exists for building HAZOP safety knowledge bases, two challenges remain: limitations in ontology design for representation of hazard propagation paths, and suboptimal performance or training efficiency of deep learning models for knowledge extraction. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative method for constructing a HAZOP knowledge graph(HPKG). First, by referring to the Scenario Object Model and the international standard IEC 61882, we propose a HAZOP Hazard Scenario Ontology (HHSO) that realizes a pattern layer capable of comprehensively representing complex pathways among various hazardous events. Second, we develop a Multi-Feature Fusion Named Entity Recognition Model (MFFNM) specifically designed for Chinese HAZOP texts, which incorporates character-level features, matched words, and Chinese radicals within an enhanced Transformer architecture for semantic fusion, thereby establishing the data layer of the knowledge graph. Experimental results on a dataset constructed from several real-world HAZOP reports show that MFFNM achieves 93.21% precision, 92.86% recall, and 93.03% F1-score with a training speed of 195.11 steps per second, outperforming existing HAZOP information extraction models. Finally, in the case analysis, by incorporating large language models and prompt-based frameworks, we further showcased the potential and capabilities of HPKG in practical applications. This methodology provides a viable solution for enhancing HAZOP knowledge management and supporting hazard prevention.}

abstract = {With the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the number of public charging piles cannot meet the immediate charging needs of EV users sometimes. The charging stations provide flexible electricity transaction schemes for users by managing charging piles and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V). Users can freely choose transaction partners and submit transaction plans to multiple charging stations. The mobility of EVs results in users randomly selecting rings multiple times, which may cause them to appear in different rings. Attackers can link multiple transaction plans and infer user privacy information. The leakage of transaction information may threaten the fairness of transactions. Aiming at the above situations, a privacy protection scheme to resist ring selection attack in Peer-to-Peer double auction V2V electricity transaction for charging stations is proposed. Firstly, the ring signcryption algorithm is improved to resist ring selection attack. Secondly, a real identity verification algorithm is designed to track malicious users. Theoretical analysis proves that the security of the proposed privacy protection scheme. The elliptic curve point multiplication is used in the scheme to improve computational efficiency. Experiments show that this scheme has low computational and communication costs. Verification cost increases slowly with the increase of the number of ring members.}

abstract = {The technological capabilities of Human Resource Analytics (HRA), enhanced by recent innovations in Machine Learning (ML), offer exciting opportunities. However, organisations often fail to realise these potentials because of a limited understanding of why individuals choose to adopt or disregard respective tools. Prior research on innovation adoption offers preliminary insights but fails to aggregate the determinants of individual adoption into actionable suggestions for decisions in the ML adoption process. Our study applies focused interviews to examine non-ML experts' reasoning for using a specific tool tailored to a public sector organisation, which corresponds to the usual end-user perspective of ML-based HRA adoption. By drawing from the HRA adoption framework, provided by Vargas et al. (2018), we contribute to the literature by identifying relevant beliefs and experiences influencing one's intention to adopt ML-based HRA and by qualitatively linking these beliefs to ML characteristics such as transparency, automation and fairness. For practitioners, we provide actionable guidance emphasising the need to ensure fairness proactively, as interviewees do not consider this aspect when deciding to adopt ML-based HRA.}

abstract = {The existing product conceptual scheme needs to be iteratively optimized to align with evolving user performance requirements driven by technological advancements. Currently, the iteration is deficient in terms of guidance on performance direction and support for rapid knowledge reuse, which hinders designers from obtaining the performance-compliant scheme. Therefore, determining the iteration direction and solution path under new performance requirements, as well as achieving rapid reuse of graphical and textual knowledge related to the initial scheme, presents a challenge for conceptual scheme iteration. To address this issue, an iterative process of product conceptual scheme based on performance constraints and rapid knowledge reuse is proposed. This process employs the design structure matrix (DSM) and k-means clustering to identify component clusters from the initial scheme and establishes performance constraint indicators through user requirements. The VIKOR algorithm is utilized to associate these clusters with performance constraint indicators, revealing the discrepancies between performance and structural space. The creative template and the conflict matrix are used to guide the initial and subsequent iterative solution paths, respectively. Combined with image-text screening, relevant patents related to the scheme iteration are acquired. An enhanced patent knowledge reuse method is proposed, which integrates an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) and template and principle feature recognition (TPFR) to extract innovative concepts from patent drawings, thereby assisting designers in iterative conceptual scheme. The validity of the proposed process and method are demonstrated through an iterative design case study of a natural gas downhole throttle valve.}

Digitalized shopfloors can leverage an unprecedented availability of data for better and faster decision-making, resulting in enhanced operational performance. However, limited research has investigated the organizational and individual implications for those who run the manufacturing lines: production managers, supervisors, team leaders, and workers. By adopting a socio-technical framework, this study aims to disentangle the effects that digitalization has on shopfloors’ organizational structures, decision-making processes, and individual competencies, as well as the interdependencies among them. An exploratory approach was adopted, based on an empirical cross-country study involving 34 semi-structured interviews conducted in the Italian and Spanish automotive sectors. Analyzed through the lenses of information-processing, knowledge-based, and dynamic capability theories, our findings reveal through five propositions how digitalization induces a “polarization” of operational decision-making: shopfloors are run by knowledgeable data-empowered production managers and autonomous information-processing team leaders on the front line, with a reduced importance of supervisors. Upskilling needs appear for team leaders but not production workers, whose involvement, however, emerges as a key factor for a successful digitalization and overall performance in initial DT stages. This study contributes to literature on digitalization by exposing managerial tensions and dynamic capabilities, along with a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of DT in terms of implications for shop-floor decision-makers. Managerial implications are directed at creating awareness about the centrality of production team leaders, and future research avenues are proposed.}

Following a targeted literature review, it dives into the specific context of AI in finance, highlighting current applications and potential pitfalls. It examines existing doctrinal and regulatory challenges encountered in governing AI, drawing comparisons, and identifying discrepancies across different regions. It further illuminates additional concerns specific to generative AI, such as bias, transparency, and accountability. In response to these concerns, some solutions for regulating generative AI are proposed, underpinned by principles that prioritize human rights, ethical considerations, and sustainability. The establishment of a global AI body to facilitate coordinated and effective oversight is also suggested. Access to justice, ethical considerations, and human rights remain central throughout the proposed approach. Ultimately, this chapter advocates for a nuanced and human-centered regulatory landscape for generative AI, ensuring its responsible application within the financial services market and beyond.}

We investigate whether confirmation bias (through prior audit opinions) occurs among auditors during the audit process and decision-making, and whether experience mitigates this effect. A total of 175 non-experienced auditors run a 2x4 between-subjects experiment (experiment 1) studying how financial information (IV with two levels: negative and neutral/positive) and previous audit report (IV with four levels: absence, negative, moderately negative, and positive) might influence the issuance of the subsequent decision-making (DV). In addition, a total of 32 junior level 1 auditors (less than one year of experience), 31 junior level 2 auditors (up to 3 years of experience) and 20 senior auditors (more than 3 years of experience) run a 2 × 4 × 3 between-subjects experiment (experiment 2) analyzing if experience (IV with three levels of experience: less than one-year, between one and three years, more than three years) mitigates this effect (experiment 2). Results confirm that the previous-year audit report affect auditors' current assessment, showing that positive and negative prior opinions persuade auditors when suggesting the next one. This finding is relevant as auditors' opinions could be conditioned by prior opinions instead of their own expertise. Our evidence also suggests that professional experience mitigates this influence on auditors' assessments. Consequently, this study has relevant implications for partners, audit professionals and audit firm recruiters. A general implication is that auditor training courses should reinforce the auditor's own expertise and criteria based on the deep analysis of financial and economic data rather than on the work of previous auditors.}

This study develops a novel calculation model for sluice gate flow in both free and submerged conditions by examining the complete energy–momentum equations and taking into account factors such as section contraction, velocity uniformity, and energy loss. Numerical simulations were subsequently conducted to establish equations for the contraction coefficient, Coriolis, Boussinesq, and energy loss coefficient. Finally, a sluice gate flow experiment was conducted, and the results of this and previous experiments were used to compare the performance of the proposed model with that of simplified energy–momentum equation models as well as the Henry, Swamee, Simulation of Irrigation Canals, and Specification models. The results indicate that the smallest prediction error, measured at just 4.51 %, was demonstrated by the proposed model, which also exhibited the lowest sensitivity to the submergence degree. Therefore, this study advances the theoretical understanding of free and submerged flows and offers a valuable reference informing flow measurements during irrigation and flood discharge processes.}

Thirty-three of the 162 papers (20.4%) at least briefly mentioned one of twelve judgmental biases affecting forecasting. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that algorithms can potentially mitigate the adverse impacts of biases inherent in human judgment related to forecasting. Furthermore, these algorithms can leverage biases as an advantage, enhancing forecast accuracy. Intriguing revelations have surfaced, focusing mainly on four biases. By providing timely, relevant, well-performing, and consistent algorithmic advice, people can be effectively influenced to improve their forecasts, considering anchoring, availability, inconsistency, and confirmation bias.

To fill this gap, following a realist perspective of entrepreneurship, this article examines digital opportunities as profit propensities afforded by a digitalized environment, while treating digital innovation and transformation as the actualization process. To elaborate, first, we coin Digitalized Opportunity Space (DOS) to describe the digitalized environment as a critical intersection of four spaces - resource, utility, digital, and institutional- that muster conditions without which digital opportunities cannot be actualized. Second, we develop four managerial archetypes - resource orchestrators, utility integrators, digital evangelists, and institutional realists- who tend to recognize digital opportunities based on their organizational location and thereby endorse different digital innovations. Third, to facilitate a systemic and balanced approach to digital transformation, we recommend group-level heuristics - the generic density perspective, the ecosystem view of the firm, multi-dimensional network effects, and disciplined imagination- which restore totality from partiality. Taken together, the DOS framework (of opportunity generation), the managerial archetypes (of opportunity recognition), and the group-level heuristics (of opportunity actualization) constitute the opportunity-centric (vs technology-centric or organization-centric) perspective on digital innovation and transformation, thereby materializing the connection between digital literature and entrepreneurship.}

To achieve the stated objectives, data was collected from user comments on YouTube car reviews and analyzed using various algorithms and part-of-speech rules, finding that Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with noun-adjective combinations proved most effective in generating comprehensible topic labels and capturing emotional expressions. The results revealed six underserved labels, one served right, and two overserved categories for new vehicle design improvements, providing valuable insights into user experiences. The insights provided in this context are expected to contribute to the potential improvement of vehicle attribute designs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the entire design process.}

abstract = {Silicon is recognized for its protective role under (a)biotic stress, yet its influence on fruit ripening remains largely unexplored. Here, ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit was used as a model to investigate the effects of external Si application on placenta and pericarp ripening. Silicon predominantly accumulated in placenta and pedicel junction, resulting in delayed ripening. This delay was associated with altered ethylene signaling, particularly via modulation of AP2/ERF transcription factors, and modifications in cell wall structure, including increased arabinogalactan proteins and altered homogalacturonan methyl-esterification. Also, silicon induced tissue-specific metabolic shifts, notably in sugars, organic acids, and polyphenolic biosynthesis, including the anthocyanin–proanthocyanidin branch point. Extensive transcriptomic reprogramming following silicon application, especially in placenta, highlighted its key role in early silicon responses. Proteins such as lipoxygenase, 60S ribosomal protein L28 and carboxypeptidases were commonly regulated in both pericarp and placenta during late cold storage, suggesting roles in ripening initiation. Proteogenomic integration identified conserved elements, like 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, and highlighted post-transcriptional regulation under cold storage. Comparison with calcium-treatment data revealed partially overlapping silicon–calcium responses, including ethylene suppression and structural remodeling. These findings establish silicon as a novel regulator of kiwifruit ripening and provide a valuable resource for exploring its role in kiwifruit and other fruits.}

However, integrating these sophisticated AI systems into academic and professional practices raises critical questions about responsible use, ethical considerations, and the preservation of human expertise. This article introduces a novel framework for understanding and implementing responsible AI use by drawing an analogy between the optimal use of LLMs and the role of the second student in an Oxford Tutorial. Through an in-depth exploration of the Oxford Tutorial system and its parallels with LLM interaction, we propose a nuanced approach to leveraging AI language models while maintaining human agency, fostering critical thinking, and upholding ethical standards. The article examines the implications of this analogy, discusses potential risks of misuse, and provides detailed practical scenarios across various fields. By grounding the use of cutting-edge AI technology in a well-established and respected educational model, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI ethics. It offers valuable insights for academics, professionals, and policymakers grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by LLMs.}

However, we propose from an information overload perspective that having more products and longer stay time may not always be better for sales. In this study, we empirically analyze 472 live streams to explore the curvilinear effects of the number of products and stay time on livestream shopping sales. Our findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between the total number of products and the average audience stay time with sales. Moreover, we find that these relationships are contingent on the total duration of the stream and the age of the streamer. The results have practical implications for retailers regarding the design of effective livestream programs.}

In addition, some dedicated mobile apps can capture driving and diagnostic data from a vehicle via a Bluetooth-enabled OBD-II scanner. In this paper, we propose a new process for effective automotive forensics. It collects and analyzes three different types of data left on an Android phone which has been connected to the OBD-II port of a vehicle via Bluetooth communication. The three types of data are OBD-II Android apps' data, Bluetooth HCI snoop log, and the main log buffer of the Android logging system. By analyzing them individually and integratedly, we find Bluetooth connection time, vehicle information, MAC address of the OBD-II scanner, vehicle velocity, sharp speeding event, sudden braking event, refueling event, and so on. We also construct a timeline of Bluetooth traffic and driving events through the timeline analysis, which can be used to determine the driver's behaviors in terms of vehicle forensics.}

Current research has so far largely neglected to include the viewpoints of the decision-affected and of surrogate decision-makers in the discussion. To address these gaps, in this study we rely on two experimental designs and complement our findings with qualitative interview data to shed light on both sides: the perspective of those affected by the decision and that of the decision maker in surrogate and ethically complex decision contexts. Findings reveal that the individual decision-making perspective may lead to opposing perceptions. Whereas the willingness to delegate an ethically challenging decision to AI in a surrogate decision context is lower than that in a non-surrogate context (decision-maker perspective), people affected by the decision do not generally prefer humans to AI (decision-affected perspective). By these findings, we contribute to the literature on AI-enabled decision-making and decision delegation to non-human entities.}

Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) are vital for organizations in managing knowledge creation, sharing, and utilization. Integrating KMS with advanced technologies like knowledge graphs and semantic technologies can greatly enhance their functionality in business contexts. This research aims to systematically reviews and evaluates studies on the integration of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. The study follows PRISMA guidelines for methodological rigor. The review includes articles published between 2005 and 2024 from databases like ScienceDirect and IEEE Xplore, focusing on keywords such as “knowledge graph” and “knowledge management systems.” From an initial 18,900 articles, 73 were selected for detailed analysis. The findings indicate that using tools like RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS enhances KMS capabilities, enabling features like semantic search and intelligent recommendations. However, challenges such as scalability, semantic disambiguation, and data privacy need to be addressed to fully realize KMS's potential in supporting organizational knowledge management.}

In response to signaling cues, they differentiate to phenotypes with robust capacities to synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling molecules. Although activated fibroblast phenotypes are associated with pronounced changes in metabolism, it remains unclear how the metabolic network upholds the effector functions of fibroblasts in the infarcted heart. We found that two enzymes that could facilitate a phosphoenolpyruvate cycle, i.e. pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2), are elevated in the heart after MI. Although Pck2 deletion had no effect on post-MI remodeling, fibroblast-specific switching of Pkm2 to Pkm1 (fbPkm2 → 1) mitigated ventricular dilation, wall thinning, and losses in ejection fraction caused by MI. Despite these salutary effects, fbPkm2 → 1 switching did not alter cardiac fibrosis in vivo, nor did it affect collagen production, cytokine or chemokine secretion, myofibroblast differentiation markers, or transcriptional regulation in vitro. Nevertheless, Pkm2 → 1 splice variant switching increased myofibroblast contractile activity as well as influenced the metabolic phenotype of fibroblasts, as shown by increased pyruvate kinase activity, higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and elevation in glycolytic intermediate abundance. Despite these changes, Pkm2 → 1 switching had relatively minor effects on glucose carbon fate, as determined by stable isotope-resolved metabolomics. Nevertheless, these metabolic data demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts exhibit minimal glucose-supported de novo glycine synthesis in vitro, yet possess high hexosamine and glucuronate biosynthetic pathway activity. Collectively, these findings reveal that fibroblast PKM isoforms influence post-MI remodeling, highlighting pyruvate kinase as a potential therapeutic target.}

Based on the practice-based view framework and the characteristics of Chinese semiconductor industry, we investigate how DT affects GTI. Utilizing data from 191 Chinese semiconductor firms during 2014–2022, we draw empirical evidence that DT has positive effects on GTI and the positive effects are more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises than in state-owned enterprises. Interestingly, media coverage and executive compensation incentives weaken the positive effects. These findings advance the literatures of GTI and practice-based view and offer valuable managerial implications to enhancing GTI of Chinese semiconductor firms.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words. Compared with the existing approaches, our proposed framework is based on the perspective of human psychology with higher credibility and significant theoretical support. In addition, we purposefully design and implement an intuitive visualisation for the framework, instead of complex numerical representations, to improve the explanation comprehensibility for a broader audience.}

Articles 3 and 4 of European Union Directive 2019/790 and sections 243 and 244 of Singapore’s Copyright Act of 2021 are examples. Both exceptions are subject to the condition of ‘lawful access’. The interpretation of this concept, which is vague and undefined by law, is crucial to these exceptions, as it may, ultimately, deprive them of all usefulness. This paper seeks to unpack the meaning of lawful access and its inverse by drawing on other uses of the concept, namely in cybercrime law, and its underlying values. This analysis points towards an understanding of unlawful access as the circumvention of technological restrictions to access, such as paywalls. However, adopting such measures may reduce the content that is freely available in the digital sphere, thereby impoverishing society and depriving creators of a powerful tool for publicising their works. Finally, the paper considers possible solutions to this problem and their drawbacks.}

The findings are as follows: (1) With environmental information disclosed, the national air quality monitoring program can reduce the outdoor fine particulate matter concentration by an overall effect of 3.31%, equivalent to an almost 1% reduction calculated by its average value. (2) This program can enhance public environmental attention and stimulate environmental practitioners’ employment, thereby achieving a synergistic effect on air pollution reduction. (3) The pollution reduction effect is expected to be more pronounced in cities located in the southern and eastern regions, cities with higher population densities, and cities with favourable ventilation capabilities. (4) In response to air pollution problems, the public will adjust their daily consumption patterns to avoid potential health risks. As a result of the short-term behavioural changes, they will be more willing to pay for clean air by purchasing household air purifiers.

It offers new insights on how ESG constraints affect performance and risk in dynamic portfolios, accounting for time-varying correlations of responsible assets. The paper uses a quantitative approach by considering two models: one using only Markowitz’s theory about mean–variance (MV) optimality without considering the ESG criteria, and another model with a constraint that enforces a minimum acceptable threshold in ESG scores, named here as MV-ESG. The minimum spanning tree (MST) method was adopted for correlation network construction, and it would consider studying dynamic correlation structures on two different periods: crisis and post-crisis. The data used are the closing prices of companies listed on the Casablanca stock exchange (CSE), obtained from their official website, while the ESG scores were obtained from Refinitiv. The results show that responsible portfolios (RPs), optimized by traditional and network approaches, are neither more profitable nor less volatile than their conventional counterparts, with the exception of peripheral portfolios (Pp), which show more attractive profitability in the responsible case, but at the cost of higher risk. While the network approach has facilitated better opportunities for higher returns, reduced losses, and better ESG scores than the traditional method, the results show that in a social orientation crisis, performance will be unfavorable; it has not been able to provide positive returns during this period.}

This study develops an advanced optimization framework. The framework improves IDC energy efficiency by leveraging their spatio-temporal flexibility for intelligent participation in power system operations. The proposed framework uses an energy portfolio comprising combined heat and power (CHP) units, fuel cells (FCs), locally controllable generators (LCGs), and renewable energy sources (RESs), to reduce reliance on the main grid while maintaining operational efficiency. To address supply/demand uncertainties, robust optimization (RO) is applied. Furthermore, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used for feature selection and engineering, identifying key parameters mostly effecting the IDCs behavior. These features are then fed into a Transformer-based machine learning (ML) model, which captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies and provides accurate forecasts. The predictions are then incorporated into the RO-based decision-making process to support real-time energy optimization. The proposed framework is validated on the IEEE 33-bus standard distribution network, simulating realistic IDC operation scenarios. Results show the higher performance of the proposed strategy, achieving at least 35.3 % improvement in mean absolute error (MAE), reduced to 16.22 kWh, and 16.7 % improvement in root mean square error (RMSE), reduced to 33.56 kWh, compared to conventional ML models. Additionally, the proposed model is evaluated by the other KPIs of root mean square relative error (RMSRE=0.35), mean square relative error (MSRE=0.12), mean absolute relative error (MARE=0.16), normalized RMSE (nRMSE=0.14), and normalized MAE (nMAE=0.08). These findings confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework in enhancing IDC operational efficiency.}

This research addresses these gaps through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative analysis using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for enrollment forecasting reveals nuanced dynamics in female enrollment, enhancing precision in predictions. Specifically, the ARIMA(0,1,1) model predicts the constant change of future values beyond the available data, while the prediction interval indicates enrollment fluctuations, gradually decreasing within the confidence intervals, and considering the simulated features. Qualitative document analysis provides contextual insights into socio-economic and policy-related factors, such as cultural attitudes, societal norms, educational policies, availability of female role models, level of support, and gender biases. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model comprehensively analyzes the impact of these (contextual) factors on the probability of female enrollment. Essentially, the prioritization of efforts should commence with addressing educational policies, promoting female role models, increasing support mechanisms, challenging cultural attitudes and societal norms, and addressing gender biases with nuanced strategies. Eventually, this study offers a cohesive understanding of female enrollment dynamics, providing a foundation for targeted interventions and policies to foster gender diversity in Tanzanian mathematics Master's programs.}

abstract = {With the trends of technology convergence and technology interdisciplinarity, technology-field (TF) resolution and classification of patents have gradually been challenged. Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs). In addition, some specific patents could contain more TFs than claimed or be assigned questionable IPC codes; subsequently, in a regular search for technology/patents, information could be missed. Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).}

Recently, machine learning (ML) has been adopted to address the supply chain’s complexities for effective planning. ML provides dynamic and data-driven solutions that enhance decision-making. It has been applied for predicting biomass yields, forecasting supply and demand, optimizing logistics and facility location, and improving the efficiency of conversion processes. This review paper highlights the role of ML in BSC planning. This study considers biomass sources such as food processing residues, animal waste (e.g., manure), in addition to forest-based and agricultural-based biomass, examining processes across all stages of a supply chain from upstream to downstream. We examine ML models in previous studies based on their learning paradigms: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and the type of performed analytics: predictive, and both predictive and prescriptive analytics. Challenges related to data availability, computational requirements, and model generalization limit ML applications in BSCs. Future research could focus on scalable and adaptable models for preprocessing, transportation, and harvesting activities by addressing the uncertainty. Integrating advanced ML could significantly enhance the resiliency, sustainability, and efficiency of BSCs, supporting bioeconomy advancement and the achievement of sustainability goals.}

abstract = {Background
Surgical lighting systems (SLSs) provide optimal lighting conditions for operating room personnel. Current systems are mainly adjusted by hand; surgeons either accommodate the light themselves or communicate their requirements to an assistant to ensure optimal surgical conditions. This poses challenges to maintaining sterility, proper accessibility, and illumination and can lead to potential collision problems. Furthermore, the personnel operating the light may not have deep medical knowledge or equipment expertise.
Objective
This paper introduces a touch-free interaction concept for controlling an SLS using speech and gestures.
Methods
We used an iterative, user-centered design approach with participatory design sessions. This process involved conducting a literature review, several observations of actual surgical sites, and engaging stakeholders through interviews and focus groups. In addition, we carried out 2 user studies: one in a virtual reality setup and another in a living laboratory environment.
Results
Our findings indicate that our interaction concept is a viable alternative for controlling an SLS. Despite some technical limitations, surgical experts found the system intuitive and useful, recognizing the significant potential for touch-free lighting adjustments in the operating room. The combination of speech and gesture modalities was seen as helpful and even necessary, with some interactions better suited to one modality over the other. Offering both modalities for each interaction provided greater flexibility.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that our proposed touch-free interaction concept can enhance surgical conditions and has the potential to replace traditional adjustment.}

Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers complementary insights into brain structure and function, thereby improving the diagnostic accuracy of neurological disorders and advancing brain-related research. However, the widespread applicability of MRI is substantially limited by restricted scanner accessibility and prolonged acquisition times. Here, we present TUMSyn, a text-guided universal MRI synthesis model capable of generating brain MRI specified by textual imaging metadata from routinely acquired scans. We ensure the reliability of TUMSyn by constructing a brain MRI database comprising 31,407 3D images across 7 MRI modalities from 13 worldwide centers and pre-training an MRI-specific text encoder to process text prompts effectively. Experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn-generated images can be utilized along with acquired MRI scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of multiple brain diseases, substantially reducing the time and cost of MRI in the healthcare system.}

abstract = {Purpose
The research paper’s purpose is to contribute to the literature by analysing the essential resources and processes required for successful commercialisation, the contemporary challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence initiatives in Türkiye, and the diverse models and methods employed by these initiatives.
Design/methodology/approach
Within the scope of the research, interviews were conducted with 10 entrepreneurs who established artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises in technoparks in Istanbul and Antalya. All 10 interviews were analysed using the MAXQDA20 software tool. Structured qualitative content analysis was used for the data analysis procedure.
Findings
Based on the research, external factors have a significant impact on the future growth opportunities of the market. Expanding the client base, gaining international recognition, and securing financing are crucial for success. However, the findings reveal challenges in the relatively young local ecosystem. One major criticism is the lack of support in marketing and sales activities for refined products. To address this, providing financial incentives and knowledge transfer to those in need is vital.
Research limitations/implications
Since the research was conducted only with entrepreneurs who established and successfully commercialised artificial intelligence-oriented enterprises, it is recommended that future studies be performed with a widespread sample group, considering this limited situation. Furthermore, to overcome survivorship bias, it is recommended that posterior studies include failed commercialisation attempts in AI ventures.
Practical implications
It can be argued that there is no deliberate approach or model for commercialization. Entrepreneurs often draw from their own prior experiences or observe industry trends. Given the limited financial resources available in the domestic market and the challenge of attracting foreign investors to Turkish brands, entrepreneurs tend to rely on internal approaches for commercialisation.
Originality/value
This research delves into the commercialisation prospects and obstacles encountered by AI start-ups in Türkiye. It comprises qualitative insights into business models, commercialisation approaches, opportunities, and challenges. The data were obtained from interviews with entrepreneurs operating in the industry.}

Leveraging foundational models integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the study introduces an approach to process diverse combustion research data, spanning experimental studies, simulations, and literature. The multifaceted nature of combustion research emphasizes the critical role of knowledge processing in navigating and extracting valuable information from a vast and diverse pool of sources. The developed approach minimizes computational and economic expenses while optimizing data privacy and accuracy. It incorporates prompt engineering and offline open-source LLMs, offering user autonomy in selecting base models. The study provides a thorough examination of text segmentation strategies, conducts comparative studies between LLMs, and explores various optimized prompts to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. By incorporating an external vector database, the framework outperforms a conventional LLM in generating accurate responses and constructing robust arguments. Additionally, the study delves into the investigation of optimized prompt templates for the purpose of efficient extraction of scientific literature. Furthermore, we present a targeted scaling study to quantify the algorithmic performance of the framework as the number of prompt tokens increases. The research addresses concerns related to hallucinations and false research articles by introducing a custom workflow developed with a detection algorithm to filter out inaccuracies. Despite identified areas for improvement, the framework consistently delivers accurate domain-specific responses with minimal human oversight. The prompt-agnostic approach introduced holds promise for future improvements. The study underscores the significance of integrating LLMs and knowledge processing techniques in scientific research, providing a foundation for advancements in data assimilation and utilization.}

In this systematic review, we review 69 existing experimental research studies on disability discrimination in hiring, published between June 1972 and January 2025, and outline key areas for future research in the field. Our review underlines significant differences in callback rates as well as variability in effect sizes across applicant and occupational characteristics. We also find that certain chronic health conditions and impairments have received more empirical attention than others. Exploring discrimination levels across a wider range of chronic conditions and impairments is necessary to move beyond monolithic understandings of disability as a binary ascriptive status and to discern different causal mechanisms associated with adverse employment outcomes among different subgroups. We argue that intersectional, theoretically grounded, and cross-national experimental approaches are needed to better understand and address disability discrimination in hiring.}

abstract = {Lodging resistance (LR) in rice is a complex trait determined by a plant’s culm strength to withstand bending or breaking force, especially under high input and direct seeded rice (DSR) conditions. Although, the sd1 gene provided early gains in LR, it has now become insufficient in modern cultivars with increased biomass and plant height. Deeper understanding of the intricate morphological and anatomical attributes, mathematical relationships and physical principles governing culm structural strength offer promise for enhancing LR. To unravel the genetic and structural basis of LR, we comprehensively phenotyped 353 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter-subspecific cross between Swarna (indica) and IRGC 39111 (tropical japonica), over multiple seasons for 12 culm strength (CS) and seven grain yield (GY) traits. Breaking resistance (BR) as a measure of internode breaking weight (IBW) and section modulus (SM) emerged as primary contributors to LR. Extensive phenotypic evaluations revealed wide variation and high heritability for most CS traits, as reflected in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimates. Conversely, traits like tiller number exhibited low heritability as evidenced by the marked difference between their genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variation indicating a strong environmental influence traits. Significant phenotypic correlations between CS and GY traits were observed. Histological analysis of the culm revealed that strong culm RILs possessed compact, thickened sclerenchymatous tissue and larger secondary vascular bundles compared to Swarna. NGS based GBS generated 63,367 SNP markers, and a high-density genetic map comprising 11,098 binned SNPs revealed 36 QTLs, including 15 major effect loci. Two consistent and major-effect QTLs—qCT7 (R2-14.49 %; 109 kb) and qIBW7 (R2-16.57 %; 33.83 kb) —on chromosome 7 were identified as key regions for LR. In-silico analysis of qCT7 revealed putative candidate genes including BRITTLE CULM1 like (OsBC1L 6, 7, 8), Cellulose synthase genes (OsCesA 3, 6, 8) and OsCSLF 1, 2, 9 involved in key processes underpinning cell wall thickening. The identification of qCT7 and its future cloning hold potential to enhance lodging resistance in rice, particularly under DSR conditions, contributing to the development of climate-resilient, high-yielding cultivars beyond the Green Revolution paradigm.}

This protracted preclinical phase offers a crucial window for potential therapeutic interventions, yet its comprehensive characterization remains elusive. Accumulating evidence suggests that amyloid-β (Aβ) may mediate neuronal hyperactivity in circuit dysfunction in the early stages of AD. At the same time, neural activity can also facilitate Aβ accumulation through intricate feed-forward interactions, complicating elucidating the conditions governing Aβ-dependent hyperactivity and its diagnostic utility. In this study, we use biophysical modeling to shed light on such conditions. Our analysis reveals that the inherently nonlinear nature of the underlying molecular interactions can give rise to the emergence of various modes of hyperactivity.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) has been a subject of debate concerning its impact on human health, particularly sleep patterns and daytime sleepiness. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing research on the effects of DST on sleep quality, duration, and sleepiness, identifying gaps, and setting a future research agenda.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The included studies were those that examined the impact of DST on sleep outcomes and daytime sleepiness in populations aged 6–85 years, using objective and subjective measures of sleep.
Results
The review analyzed 27 studies, revealing heterogeneous findings. The transition to DST was associated with adverse effects on sleep duration and quality, as well as increased sleepiness, more evident in evening chronotypes.
Conclusions
Although the transition to DST appears to negatively affect sleep patterns, particularly in spring and among evening chronotypes, definitive conclusions are hampered by methodological inconsistencies and external influences. This review highlights the need for future research employing standardized, objective measures across representative samples to elucidate the true impact of transitions to and from DST and the difference between standard time and permanent DST on sleep and daytime functioning. Addressing these gaps is crucial for informed public health policies.}

In contrast to previous approaches that primarily focus on job recommendations based on a fixed set of concrete job advertisements, our approach involves the creation of a corpus that combines data from the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and EURopean Employment Services (EURES) job advertisements, ensuring an up-to-date and well-defined representation of general job titles in the labor market. Our two-step evaluation approach, consisting of an application-grounded evaluation using EURES job advertisements and a human-grounded evaluation using real-world resumes and Human Resources (HR) expert feedback, provides a comprehensive assessment of CareerBERT’s performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that CareerBERT outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art embedding approaches while showing robust effectiveness in human expert evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of CareerBERT in supporting career consultants by generating relevant job recommendations based on resumes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of job consultations and expanding the perspectives of job seekers.

A laser beam with a Gaussian distribution was used to expose the solid thermal medium, thereby bringing a source of heat into the system. The study is grounded in the expanded theory of thermoelasticity without energy dissipation, which considers the interconnection between thermal, elastic, and magnetic phenomena. This theoretical framework serves as a basis for understanding the interactions and behaviors of thermal and mechanical processes within an elastic material. The system was analyzed using a direct approach, employing the Laplace transformation method to provide solutions for the system's equations. This methodology enables the computation and presentation of precise equations for several domains of concern, such as displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses. The discussion and analysis focused on a copper-based material, and graphical representations were used to demonstrate the behavior of the researched physical fields. These graphical representations aid in comprehending the development of displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses within the material caused by the laser beam and the interplay between thermal, magnetic, and elastic processes. The results demonstrate that the laser pulse parameters have a significant impact on the temperature and thermal stress distribution, thereby influencing the thermo-mechanical reactions of the solid medium. Ultimately, this study enhances our comprehension of the intricate behavior and interplay of thermal, magnetic, and elastic phenomena in thermoelastic materials.}

Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of online PEMFCs is challenging, primarily due to factors such as complex nonlinear degradation patterns and unknown data.

The performance of RUL predictions was evaluated using different starting RUL prediction points to compare them with the existing study. The experiments are conducted with different future prediction steps for future RUL prediction to determine the model's prediction step limit.

Online dating apps have become increasingly popular in recent years as a tool for finding partners. However, there is a gap in research on the comprehensive factors that influence users’ intentions to prefer online dating apps over traditional means, specifically in Indonesia. The present study thus proposes using web semantic techniques and integrates the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to get a holistic perspective on predicting users’ intentions in online dating. The questionnaires analyzed using SEM-PLS indicate that the attitude toward online dating is positively affected by the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Additionally, attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy positively affect the intention to utilize online dating apps. The research thus introduces a consolidated technology to offer new insights and implications for the design and marketing of online dating apps by highlighting the importance of user-friendly interfaces, perceived benefits, social influence, and individual confidence in using the apps.}

The results reveal that recommendations by ChatGPT and the existing AI recommender similarly influence the consumer purchase journey from perceived performance (PP) toward intention to adopt a consideration set (IC) via trust in the recommender (TR) and trust in recommended products (TP). However, ChatGPT has a higher impact of PP on TR and a higher IC than the existing AI recommender. The higher the level of brand awareness, the higher the TP, but the gap is narrowed by the moderating effect significantly at low and medium levels but not at high level, which leads to IC. The study underscores the importance of marketers enhancing brand awareness despite the effectiveness of AI recommenders in influencing consumer choice. This empirical comparative study contributes to marketing literature by elucidating the interplay between ChatGPT, AI recommenders, consumer choice and brand awareness.}

Traditional empirical methods often fail to capture the complex interactions between flow, sediment, and pier geometry, leading to inaccurate scour depth predictions. This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach to improve scour depth prediction accuracy and interpretability. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from experimental studies reported in the literature, encompassing a range of pier configurations, sediment characteristics, and fluid properties under steady current conditions in both clear-water and live-bed environments. Advanced ML models, including ensemble techniques (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF)), deep learning models (Neural Network (NN), 1D convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), Deep neural network (DNN)), and traditional methods (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Logistic regression (LR)), were implemented and evaluated. XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive performance, outperforming both empirical methods and other ML models, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85 on the testing dataset between the predicted and observed results. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which highlighted the importance of features such as pier geometry, sediment properties, and fluid dynamics. Pile diameter (bp) and pile spacing in the perpendicular flow directions (Sn) were identified as the most influential parameters in determining normalized scour depth, followed by bottom pile cap elevation (h0), pile cap longitudinal extension from column (f1), and pile cap thickness (T), which also play significant roles. In contrast, pile spacing parallel to the flow direction (Sm), the number of pile lines parallel to the flow direction (n), and shape factor of CBP exhibited minimal influence. The proposed ML framework not only outperforms conventional methods but also provides interpretable predictions, offering a reliable tool to support scour risk assessment in bridge design and maintenance.}

With much of the literature on DEE focused on organisational-level analysis, there is a need for further research that includes system-level analysis, and specifically research that explores how ecosystem actors support Digital Entrepreneurship (DE) by facilitating adaptation of the institutional environment. We analyse a single longitudinal case study of the Danish FinTech ecosystem, a DEE that developed in the context of a traditional, highly regulated industry and a turbulent global FinTech scene. FinTech DEEs have emerged across the world as a response to a global reshaping of financial institutions that resulted from the global financial crisis and ongoing technological shifts. We use this case to explore two questions: “what institutional forces influence the development of the DEE?”, and “how do institutional entrepreneurs facilitate institutional changes to develop a DEE?” We find the development of the Danish FinTech DEE was enabled and shaped by changes to institutions that support: (i) new collaboration dynamics and mechanisms, particularly between incumbent firms and start-ups, (ii) adaptations to the regulatory framework, and (iii) the development of global connections. Institutional change required collective efforts, depending on different institutional entrepreneurs at different times. Neutral leadership of institutional entrepreneurs became crucial for institutional change. Furthermore, both system and organisation-level agencies influenced institutional change during the development of the DEE. As such, this study contributes to a better understanding of DEE development and, therefore, the conditions that foster DE in the FinTech field.}

However, studies have yet to highlight and isolate the consequences of changing demographic dynamics in different world regions on global patterns of biodiversity. To fill this research gap, we link a computational general equilibrium economic model (GTAP-AEZ) with biodiversity characterization factors representing potential species loss per unit area due to human land-uses in different world regions for mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants combined. This allows us to project the impact on species loss of a business-as-usual global economic scenario between 2021 and 2041, driven by changes in population, GDP, capital stock, labor force, and productivity growth. Second, we focus on demographic change as a sole driver of biodiversity loss and contrast the impacts of historical population growth (2001−2021) with those of future demographic trends (2021–2041) using the same biodiversity metric and economic model. Third, we analyze how the biodiversity projections are affected by the underlying uncertainty in 2041 population based on the United Nations Probabilistic Population Projections. Finally, we also identify those economic sectors and the three major market mechanisms driving the land-use change that explains biodiversity loss in each region. These are: domestic substitution of imports; direct increase in trade to satisfy the increased population abroad; and indirect increase in trade through third markets. The findings highlight how slowing population growth in the wealthiest countries will benefit biodiversity in some parts of the world, while continued strong population growth in Africa will lead to more rapid biodiversity loss in other regions. Our results provide insights into the global hotspots, drivers, and linkages that can be useful to diverse stakeholders (businesses, governments, and conservationists) for making progress towards the achievement of the global biodiversity targets and the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land).}

The findings indicate that reducing technological uncertainty enhances both online word-of-mouth (active peer effects) and government procurement (passive peer effects), both of which facilitate greater NEVs adoption. Additionally, moderation effect analyses suggest that social trust amplifies the negative impact of technological uncertainty on NEV consumption intensity, thereby indirectly validating the role of peer effects in fostering NEV adoption. Ultimately, this research underscores that, even without government fiscal subsidies, peer effects can serve as a vital self-reinforcing mechanism in adopting green technologies.}

Writing in the digital age has transformed from a mere communicative practice into a computational interface for multimodal creation—establishing a new paradigm where natural language functions as executable code for artificial intelligence systems. This research examines the pedagogical implications of this “Writing is Coding” framework, focusing on how learners navigate cross-media AI co-creation processes. Through a comprehensive three-round experiment, 102 undergraduate students engaged in progressive AI collaboration across textual, visual, and video modalities, using natural language as their primary creative instrument. Employing grounded theory methodology, the researchers analyzed data from student reflection journals, teacher observation logs, and semi-structured interviews to identify emergent patterns in AI-human creative partnerships. Five interconnected themes emerged: (1) prompt engineering as algorithmic thinking, (2) multimodal literacy development, (3) collaborative negotiation of creative agency, (4) emotional engagement through iterative refinement, and (5) metacognitive awareness of human-AI boundaries. Findings suggest that the “Writing is Coding” framework facilitates a deeper understanding of computational processes while enhancing creative expression. The three-round progression demonstrated increasing student comfort with AI collaboration, though tensions around authorship and creative identity persisted. This research contributes to emerging pedagogical approaches that position writing as a form of programming in AI-enhanced learning environments, with implications for curriculum design and digital literacy development.}

In the presence of sorafenib, the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen–positive cells was significantly higher in clofazimine-, cyclosporin A–, and itraconazole-treated reconstructed human epidermis models than in sorafenib-treated models, and candidate drugs suppressed sorafenib-induced apoptosis in normal human epidermal keratinocytes.

The main goal of the proposed method is to adaptively select and combine LF data, by assessing its quality, to create the most accurate surrogate. The core idea lies in interpreting the quality levels of LF data sources as the relative importance of LF surrogates that serve as basis functions in a multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate. Based on this approach, the proposed AQBMF surrogate framework comprises four main stages. In the first stage, a newly defined augmented MF formulation is constructed, initially assuming equal importance for all LF data sources. In the second stage, LF surrogates are ranked by importance through the proposed MF basis screening method. In the third stage, promising candidate surrogates are systematically constructed based on the importance ranking of the LF surrogates. During this stage, both the selection and filtering of LF data, as well as the hierarchical and ensemble combination-based MF methods are considered. In the last stage, the best surrogate is selected from the candidates using the proposed algorithm. Various benchmark test results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework. Finally, engineering application results show that the proposed AQBMF surrogate achieves higher accuracy than existing ones within the same computational budget.}

abstract = {With the advent of smartphones, we can access internet services regardless of location. This shift in environment has led to the demand for services that can be utilized anytime, anywhere. Consequently, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology, which automates simple and repetitive tasks in industrial settings, is gaining significant attention. There is a growing trend to combine this with Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot technology to achieve full automation and handle higher-level tasks. However, when performing high-level tasks based on an AI chatbot-based RPA system, situations arise where the AI chatbot relies on the user’s judgment. In such scenarios, the absence of an appropriate mechanism or technology to perform identity verification between the user and the AI chatbot exposes the system to security threats like personal information leakage and system takeover. Accordingly, this paper proposes an OAuth 2.0 integrated authentication framework utilizing a context-based risk assessment approach. This framework aims to reduce the likelihood of security threats and minimize the scale of damage caused by such threats. It achieves this by enabling access control based on the user’s context while requiring the user to provide minimal information when utilizing the AI chatbot-based RPA system. More specifically, the proposed framework employs a risk assessment based on the sigmoid function, which accounts for sensitivity variations across different contexts. This approach enables sensitive adjustments to access permissions in response to contextual changes, rather than applying a fixed risk assessment. This demonstrates the framework’s capability to provide a trustworthy automated work environment through appropriate access control. Specifically, the proposed risk assessment formula quantitatively analyzes sensitivity changes for each contextual variable through mathematical interpretation. Based on this, it structurally derives the correlation between risk scores and policies. Furthermore, experimental results confirm consistency between policy flow and risk assessment, such as issuing ‘Full Access Tokens’ in normal situations and applying Access Denied in high-risk situations. Furthermore, using data flow diagrams and STRIDE, potential security threats within the proposed framework were modeled. Simulation of actual security threats demonstrated the framework’s ability to mitigate these threats, with an average latency of 9.22ms and memory usage of 64.00MB required for threat response. This empirically demonstrates that the proposed framework is a valid authentication structure capable of simultaneously achieving real-time performance, security, and lightweight characteristics even in AI-based automated environments.}

abstract = {Background
Metabolic reprogramming has recently been recognized as a critical driver in the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). While Songorine has been shown to modulate macrophage metabolism, its direct effects on chondrocyte metabolism and inflammation remain poorly understood.
Purpose
This study set out to explore how Songorine regulates glycolysis-driven inflammation in OA chondrocytes and to elucidate a novel mechanism linking metabolic reprogramming, histone lactylation, and inflammatory signaling.
Study Design
We utilized both in vivo OA rat models and in vitro IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation models to assess Songorine's metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects.
Methods
Histological and biochemical analyses were performed on OA rat joints to evaluate cartilage degeneration, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory markers. RNA sequencing, ¹³C-glucose metabolic flux assays, and Seahorse extracellular flux analysis were used to characterize glycolytic activity. Histone lactylation levels were assessed by immunoblotting and CUT&Tag. The binding between Songorine and PFKFB3 was evaluated by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
Results
OA cartilage exhibited elevated glycolysis and inflammation, while Songorine treatment significantly restored metabolic homeostasis and alleviated inflammation. In IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, Songorine suppressed glycolytic flux, reduced lactate production and histone H4K12 lactylation. Lactate-induced H4K12 lactylation promoted the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and reinforced a PFKFB3-mediated positive feedback loop that sustained glycolysis and inflammation. SPR confirmed that Songorine directly binds to and inhibits PFKFB3, thereby disrupting this loop.
Conclusion
Songorine protects cartilage by directly targeting PFKFB3, thereby limiting glycolytic-driven lactate production, histone lactylation, and downstream inflammatory signaling. These findings uncover a novel glycolysis–lactylation–inflammation axis in OA and support Songorine as a promising metabolic modulator for OA therapy.}

Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., BERT, Bard, Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), LLaMA, etc., have the ability to take instructions, or prompts, from users and generate answers and solutions based on very large volumes of text-based training data. This paper assesses the impact and potential impact of ChatGPT on the field of digital forensics, specifically looking at its latest pre-trained LLM, GPT-4. A series of experiments are conducted to assess its capability across several digital forensic use cases including artefact understanding, evidence searching, code generation, anomaly detection, incident response, and education. Across these topics, its strengths and risks are outlined and a number of general conclusions are drawn. Overall this paper concludes that while there are some potential low-risk applications of ChatGPT within digital forensics, many are either unsuitable at present, since the evidence would need to be uploaded to the service, or they require sufficient knowledge of the topic being asked of the tool to identify incorrect assumptions, inaccuracies, and mistakes. However, to an appropriately knowledgeable user, it could act as a useful supporting tool in some circumstances.}

Such disruption may lead to bacterial translocation, subsequently triggering enterohepatic and systemic inflammation. Impaired intestinal barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, particularly chronic gut and liver diseases. In this review, we will summarize the fundamental functions of intestinal barrier and discuss clinical correlations between intestinal barrier dysfunction and diseases such as colitis, colorectal cancer, and chronic liver diseases including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

This study explores students’ level of self-determination, learning engagement, and use of language technology toward English language learning with an analysis in different engineering disciplines and correlation between variables. The descriptive-quantitative-correlation approach with different instruments was adopted and administered to 369 students in an international engineering college. Results revealed that there is a positive relationship between self-determination and learning engagement, where students are determined and recognize the importance of English learning. Moreover, there is a significant relationship between learning engagement and language technology engagement, indicating that there is indeed a certain correlation between the degree of learning engagement and use of language technology in the learning process. However, there is no significant relationship between self-determination and language technology engagement, which suggests individuality and independence in language learning and indicates a need for additional support in technology integration.}

However, supervised learning methods have encountered several common challenges, such as overfitting and underfitting, in the process of mineral prospectivity modeling, particularly due to imbalanced sample sizes used for model training. This imbalance could limit the generalization capability of models and result in inadequate predictive performance of individual models. The present study introduced a novel hybrid ensemble model (HEM) that integrates various learner methods, including generative adversarial network (GAN) and transfer learning techniques, to effectively address the issues above. These intelligent prediction techniques were applied to analyze the geological, geochemical, and geophysical dataset in order to delineate potential areas for W-Sn mineralization in Malipo County, Yunnan Province, China. Meanwhile, some well-established supervised learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Boosting-based model (e.g., LightGBM), and Bagging-based models, which demonstrated exceptional performance in dealing with classification issues were also integrated into the HEM. The weights for integrating these models were determined automatically using the equidistant-sampling technique. The superior performance of the HEM in identifying known deposits made it an efficient tool for mineral prediction mapping. Additionally, this model also offered high flexibility and scalability by allowing adjustments to the types and quantities of base learners based on data characteristics.}

However, the conventional standard reconstruction methods under sparse view may lead to low-quality image in photoacoustic tomography. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sparse sinogram (projection domain) data reconstruction method based on mean-reverting diffusion model. By simulating the forward and reverse of the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) processes from high-quality images (full-view projection data) to degraded low-quality images (sparse-view projection data), this method enables the restoration of sparse-view projection data to full-view projection data without relying on any task-specific prior knowledge. Blood vessels simulation data, circular phantom data, the animal in vivo experimental data, and data acquired from an actual PAT system were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In the experimental tests on the “T”-shaped sample data acquired from the actual imaging system, even under extremely sparse projections (16 projections), the proposed method demonstrated significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to Cycle-GAN and U-Net, with increases of 16.46 dB (∼69.2 %) and 0.86 dB in the projection domain, respectively. This method enhances the sparse reconstruction capability of PAT in the sinogram domain, which is expected to reduce the costs and shorten the acquisition time of PAT in the practical applications, thus further expanding the application scope of PAT.}

abstract = {Background
The use of real-world data (RWD) warehouses for research in Asia is on the rise, but current trends remain largely unexplored. Given the varied economic and health care landscapes in different Asian countries, understanding these trends can offer valuable insights.
Objective
We sought to discern the contemporary landscape of linked RWD warehouses and explore their trends and patterns in 3 Asian countries with contrasting economies and health care systems: Taiwan, India, and Thailand.
Methods
Using a systematic scoping review methodology, we conducted an exhaustive literature search on PubMed with filters for the English language and the past 5 years. The search combined Medical Subject Heading terms and specific keywords. Studies were screened against strict eligibility criteria to identify eligible studies using RWD databases from more than one health care facility in at least 1 of the 3 target countries.
Results
Our search yielded 2277 studies, of which 833 (36.6%) met our criteria. Overall, single-country studies (SCS) dominated at 89.4% (n=745), with cross-country collaboration studies (CCCS) being at 10.6% (n=88). However, the country-wise breakdown showed that of all the SCS, 623 (83.6%) were from Taiwan, 81 (10.9%) from India, and 41 (5.5%) from Thailand. Among the total studies conducted in each country, India at 39.1% (n=133) and Thailand at 43.1% (n=72) had a significantly higher percentage of CCCS compared to Taiwan at 7.6% (n=51). Over a 5-year span from 2017 to 2022, India and Thailand experienced an annual increase in RWD studies by approximately 18.2% and 13.8%, respectively, while Taiwan’s contributions remained consistent. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) was predominant in Taiwan (n=410, or 65.8% of SCS) but less common in India (n=12, or 14.8% of SCS) and Thailand (n=11, or 26.8% of SCS). CER percentages in CCCS were similar across the 3 countries, ranging from 19.2% (n=10) to 29% (n=9). The type of RWD source also varied significantly across countries, with India demonstrating a high reliance on electronic medical records or electronic health records at 55.6% (n=45) of SCS and Taiwan showing an increasing trend in their use over the period. Registries were used in 26 (83.9%) CCCS and 31 (75.6%) SCS from Thailand but in <50% of SCS from Taiwan and India. Health insurance/administrative claims data were used in most of the SCS from Taiwan (n=458, 73.5%). There was a consistent predominant focus on cardiology/metabolic disorders in all studies, with a noticeable increase in oncology and infectious disease research from 2017 to 2022.
Conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of RWD research in Taiwan, India, and Thailand. The observed differences and trends emphasize the unique economic, clinical, and research settings in each country, advocating for tailored strategies for leveraging RWD for future health care research and decision-making.

Beating behavior of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a symptomatic individual and an asymptomatic individual carrying a mutation for Brugada syndrome was analyzed with Ca2+ imaging method. Using machine learning methods, it is studied whether it is possible to classify the current peak data successfully and whether differences in the two mutant cell lines could be observed. We applied more machine learning methods than before. Baseline signals were first recorded and they were then exposed to adrenaline and these to an antiarrhythmic drug flecainide which should provoke the disease phenotype. Calcium transient signals derived from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were used for all computational analyses executed. Good classification results were generated with effective machine learning methods. Various test situations were applied to study how different parts of data can be separated to ensure their differences. Good results were gained that support the target so that it is possible to analyze whether the drug impacted on iPSC-CMs. It is also possible to separate which cells were affected by the drug and which were not affected. An important finding was that there were significant differences between calcium transient signals data originated from control subjects and patients and also between responses of the cells from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.}

Design of inquisitive bots which ask questions on a given topic of interest is one such application. To improve the quality of questions generated by such a bot while leveraging the power of transformer models, it is necessary to add a component to the pipeline that also considers the topic of discussion. This research examines transformer models pre-trained on natural language with the addition of topic context and subsequent optimization using genetic algorithms to generate more relevant questions. In our hybrid framework, we first use topic modeling for extracting context from the conversation history and then use these topics as input in the conversational training pipeline for generating questions on the given category. We attempt to fine-tune the framework to find the optimized weights using genetic algorithm. Our experiments are carried out using a large-scale dataset that is readily available to the public for the purpose of conversational question generation. We further evaluate the trained models on a dataset of Java passages performing qualitative analysis. Our analysis suggests that utilizing the genetic algorithm-optimized topic aware mechanism improves the quality of generated questions substantially in the conversational set-up.}

In the FC model, in-class sessions are typically conducted in teams to promote active participation, group discussion, problem-solving, and collaborative learning. However, a review of previous studies reveals that the factors contributing to behavioral engagement in team-based FCs remain underexplored. Thus, we aim to explore team-based FCs by integrating the theories of expectancy–value and social motivation. Given that collaborative norms are crucial for enhancing students’ behavioral engagement in teams, we propose that team collaborative norms moderate the relationship between individuals’ beliefs (value and competence beliefs) and behavioral engagement. We collected data from 808 students across 238 teams in 28 team-based FCs and used a hierarchical linear model to examine the hypothesized relationships. The results indicated a positive relationship between utility value and students’ behavioral engagement, as well as between interest value and engagement in team-based FCs. Conversely, there was a negative relationship between learning anxiety and students’ behavioral engagement. No significant relationship was found between attainment value and engagement. Additionally, self-efficacy and team collaborative norms were positively associated with students’ behavioral engagement in team-based FCs. Notably, the moderating effect of team collaborative norms on the relationships between utility value and behavioral engagement and between interest value and behavioral engagement was stronger under high team collaborative norms than under low ones. This study contributes to existing research by validating the role of team collaborative norms in students’ behavioral engagement within team-based FCs.}

In agile environments with pressure due to changing requirements, it is necessary to incorporate user needs into product development to ensure product success. Accordingly, User Experience (UX) methods should be integrated into the agile environment. The nature of the disciplines Agile and UX shows similarities that form a reasonable basis for this, like avoiding false expectations using continuous reviews and reducing late changes and associated costs.
Objective:

To support researchers and practitioners, we provide an overview of the development of the Agile UX research field to detect research gaps. Challenges and solution approaches are identified to provide concrete assistance in the integration of Agile and UX.
Methods:
Based on a tertiary review of 30 related work papers, the evolution of the research field and gaps are identified. Then, a secondary systematic literature review of 86 papers is used to examine challenges and solution approaches to the integration of Agile and UX to make recommendations for action.
Results:
28 challenges (e.g., “Interdisciplinary Knowledge”) and 103 solution approaches (e.g., “UserX Stories”) were identified, whereby one challenge can have several solution approaches and vice versa. Furthermore, all challenges were still addressed in recent years (2020-2023) and cannot be considered solved.
Conclusion:
With our results, practitioners can identify solution approaches that may be relevant for internal company challenges and make use of synergies.

In this study, multiple one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) are developed for automatically extracting implicit damage-sensitive features from the structural raw dynamic responses to localize damage in the pile foundations of pedestrian bridges considering uncertainties such as environmental and operational variations (EOVs) inherent in dynamic responses. For this purpose, transient dynamics numerical computation models are established to simulate the multi-point dynamic response of the structure under different typical damage scenarios, forming the baseline dataset. Then, on-site vibration tests are conducted on the structural prototype. Ambient vibrations of the real intact bridge are considered EOVs and integrated into the baseline dataset, forming the test dataset. Additionally, the intact structural dynamic response with measured EOVs replaces the simulated intact structural dynamic response in the baseline dataset to form a reference dataset. The network architectures based on one-dimensional convolutional layers proposed in this paper are trained on the baseline dataset and reference datasets to obtain baseline and reference models. Subsequently, model performance evaluation is conducted on the test dataset, and the results indicate a significant decrease in the performance of damage models based on a single deep learning when EOVs are present. However, integrating the baseline and reference models achieves zero false negative/positive predictions which is safety-oriented and an exemplary classification accuracy of up to 97.2 %.}

Although Kickstarter has been requiring technology entrepreneurs to disclose project risk information since 2012, the value of this disclosure remains underexplored amidst controversies in the literature about whether project risk description enhances crowdfunding success. In addressing these issues, this research employs signaling theory and curvilinear analysis to examine what project risk description length and sentiment levels maximize crowdfunding success for technology projects, particularly those in developing countries. Statistical analyses of 1059 campaigns on Kickstarter partly support and challenge this study's theorizations. Risk description sentiment and length have U-shaped and inverted U-shaped effects on crowdfunding success respectively. Although these effects do not differ across projects in developed and developing countries, detailed risk descriptions generally yield better results for projects in developing countries. These insights advance and clarify the underdeveloped literature on the link between project risk description and crowdfunding outcomes and offer guidance on how developing country entrepreneurs can couch project risk statements to optimize crowdfunding success.}

We surveyed 2,026 Chinese undergraduates who had used GenAI in their studies. The findings indicated that the influence from others on using GenAI and hedonic motivation toward using GenAI were positively related to undergraduates’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge and negatively related to their view of it as a hindrance. Conversely, the anthropomorphic features of GenAI showed the opposite pattern. Undergraduates who viewed using GenAI as a challenge reported more positive emotions and demonstrated higher GenAI-powered learning productivity. Those who saw it as a hindrance experienced more negative emotions but showed no significant relationship with GenAI-powered learning productivity. Moreover, undergraduate students’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge or a hindrance and their emotional experiences played mediating roles in this influential process. Importantly, these relationships varied significantly across different student groups, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in GenAI integration. Our study provides insights for educators and policymakers on effectively integrating GenAI in higher education.}

abstract = {In pursuing the goals of sustainable development and transiting from fossil fuel-dependent electricity generation to renewable and sustainable alternatives as endorsed by COP28, Malaysia set a 31 % target for renewable-energy in the power generation mix by 2025. This underlines Malaysia's commitment to combat climate change, mainly by reducing its economy-wide GDP carbon intensity by 45 % from the 2005 levels by 2030. To better understand the effects of renewable energy expansion on the economy, environment, electricity output and input-mix, a computable general equilibrium model is applied using an updated benchmark. The simulation results show that increasing the share of coal and gas in the power generation mix compromises emission reduction targets. Further, there is a trade-off between subsidized natural gas supplies and power generation and exports. The results also show that a larger proportion of renewable energy leads to improved welfare. As the share of gas and coal in renewable energy generation is not very high, its impact on carbon emissions is limited. However, if renewable energy expansion is complemented by subsidy rationalizations, the positive impacts are more pronounced. In terms of policy implications, the findings suggest that Malaysia must step up its emission reduction efforts by augmenting the generation of renewable rather than non-renewable resources. Complementary initiatives such as emission abatement policies and consumption subsidies for refined oil products and fossil-fuel power generation should be rationalized to expand renewable resources, improve energy security, and attain emission reductions.}

abstract = {This study investigates how technology-enabled democratization affects market structures and incumbent firm strategies, with a focus on generative AI and content marketing agencies (CMAs). While past technologies augment marketing capabilities, generative AI redistributes core creation, technical, and economic capabilities—challenging traditional agency–client dynamics and prompting strategic reconfigurations among incumbent firms. Drawing on a qualitative study of 22 professionals from CMAs and their clients, we develop a framework showing how generative AI enables widespread content marketing capabilities, alters content marketing market structures, and forces CMAs to redefine their value propositions. Our findings reveal a shift from execution-based services to expertise-driven roles, including creative consulting, hyper-personalization, and AI-enabled service innovation. We contribute theoretically by extending the concept of technology-enabled democratization, offering a structured framework that links capability redistribution, market restructuring, and incumbent response strategies. Practically, we propose a playbook to help CMAs adapt to this transformation through (1) strategic repositioning, (2) operational integration, (3) ethics, regulation, and compliance, (4) and market and client engagement. Overall, the study offers conceptual and managerial insights into the evolving interplay between generative AI, market democratization, and marketing agency transformation.}

abstract = {Data centers increasingly rely on Operational Data Analytics (ODA) for real-time insights from vast streams of telemetry data. They typically utilize NoSQL databases for scalability and to handle diverse data types, which results in unstructured data representations and poses significant challenges for data retrieval and interoperability. Indeed, the lack of standardization, combined with schema flexibility and complex data structures, makes it difficult for system administrators to write and execute queries, ultimately complicating the automation of data retrieval tasks. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), with their latent knowledge, promise a ready-to-use AI-driven data interoperability layer, enabling data retrieval through natural language input. However, they often generate inaccurate or hallucinated query code when handling heterogeneous data sources and complex data structures. In this paper, we present EXASAGE, the first operational data analysis assistant for ODA, which leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based approach to provide an AI-driven interoperable layer that addresses LLM limitations and simplifies data retrieval tasks in data center facilities through a prototype implementation. EXASAGE employs an LLM-based query generator to convert natural language into SPARQL queries (native to KGs), executed at a graph database endpoint, along with a virtual KG approach that dynamically generates KGs with only the data relevant to the user’s input query, significantly reducing the storage overhead associated with a fully materialized KG in such large-scale telemetry systems. In evaluations on 1000 user input queries, EXASAGE achieved a 93.6 % accuracy in generating correct SPARQL code and retrieving correct answers, significantly outperforming the 25 % accuracy of NoSQL/SQLite queries, which frequently exhibited severe hallucinations. Furthermore, SPARQL queries were generally more concise and demonstrate shorter inference and execution times compared to NoSQL/SQLite queries. The average end-to-end time for a single execution cycle was 12.77s, making it suitable for interactive, non-critical operational data analysis tasks. The maximum observed storage overhead across all generated virtual KGs was just 52.62 MiB.}

abstract = {Despite rapid healthcare digitization, extracting information from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), such as nursing notes, remains challenging due to inconsistencies and ambiguities in clinical documentation. Generative large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for automating information extraction (IE); however, their application in real-world clinical settings, such as residential aged care (RAC), is limited by critical gaps. Prior studies have often focused on structured EHR data and conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, overlooking critical aspects like robustness, fairness, bias, and contextual relevance, particularly in unstructured clinical narratives. To address these gaps, this study develops a holistic evaluation framework for clinical IE from free-text nursing notes in the Australian RAC. We systematically evaluate 17 LLMs, including general-purpose and healthcare-specific variants (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Gemini, T5) across retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and few-shot learning configurations (one-shot, three-shot, four-shot, five-shot). The evaluation focuses on two clinical IE tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and summarization. Results reveal LLaMA 3.1 achieved 88.58 % accuracy, 87.43 % F1 score in NER, 88.18 % F1 score, and 83.15 % relevance in summarization. However, robustness remained low (4.00 % for NER, 4.31 % for summarization) despite excellent fairness (99.9 %) and minimal bias (0.11 %) in both tasks. Further, healthcare-specific LLMs slightly outperform general models, and RAG-based approaches (LangChain, LlamaIndex) yield superior results. Task-specific optimal few-shot settings emerged: three-shot for NER and five-shot for summarization. This study provides a foundation for safely integrating generative AI into clinical decision support.}

abstract = {Durian (Durio zibethinus L.), an economically important fruit crop in Southeast Asia, is known for its strong sulfuryl aroma resulting from the accumulation of sulfur-containing compounds. However, our understanding of sulfur metabolism in fruit remains limited. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production. This study provides novel insights into sulfur metabolism in durian fruit.}

French Broad River Basin, southeastern United States
Study focus
We combined fluvial and dendro-based paleoflood hydrologic data with instrumented data to understand long-term changes in extreme flow events.
New hydrological insights for the region
Droughts and extreme floods are underrepresented in streamflow records because of short instrumentation records. This study is among the first to develop a centennial-scale record (1734–2024) of hydrologic extreme events in the southeastern U.S. Interannual and interdecadal variability of extreme floods and droughts was observed. This suggests that hydrologic volatility is a persistent pattern in basins where precipitation is heavily influenced by the Bermuda High (North Atlantic subtropical high) and El Niño Southern Oscillation. Landfalling hurricanes generated some of the largest floods in the record. A late spring flood in 1791 CE, however, surpassed the magnitude of all other floods (0.0025 annual exceedance probability), including the 2024 CE Hurricane Helene flood (0.02 annual exceedance probability). Flood frequency and magnitude has declined since the 1800s, however. In contrast, drought severity has increased in the last century. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest flood frequency analyses reliant on floods-of-record from the last century to represent flood extremes may be underestimating flood risks, and droughts and extreme floods both occur on annual and decadal timescales, setting the stage for frequent sequencing of hydrologic extremes in the southeastern U.S.}
