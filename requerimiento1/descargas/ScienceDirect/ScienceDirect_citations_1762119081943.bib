abstract = {Background
Morton’s interdigital neuroma, caused by compression of the interdigital nerve, often requires surgery when conservative treatment fail. This study compared open neurectomy and percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR), focusing on various predictive factors.
Methods
A retrospective study, comprising 46 patients (58 feet) with Morton’s neuroma who underwent either open excision (n = 24) or PILR (n = 22) from 2012 to 2022. Data included demographics, MRI-measured neuroma size, complications, and revision surgery. Outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and satisfaction scores.
Results
Open excision yielded better outcomes than PILR for neuromas larger than 7.40 mm, with lower VAS scores (2.3 vs. 3.9), higher FAAM scores (87 vs. 72), and greater satisfaction (3.2 vs. 2.1). Neuroma width predicted outcomes in the PILR group.
Conclusion
Open excision is superior for larger neuromas, while PILR may suit smaller ones (<7.40 mm).
Level of evidence
Level III cohort study
Clinical relevance
This study highlights the importance of neuroma width in determining the success of percutaneous intermetatarsal ligament release (PILR). Our findings suggest that PILR may be more appropriate for smaller neuromas (<7.40 mm), while open excision offers better outcomes for larger neuromas. This insight could guide surgeons in selecting the most suitable surgical approach, optimizing patient outcomes, and minimizing complications.}

abstract = {Lung cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with treatment strategies primarily including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Although immunotherapies targeting T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are widely used, therapies targeting neutrophils remain underdeveloped. Neutrophils are regarded as a specialized cell population that, once matured, lack the capacity for proliferation and are rapidly depleted in circulation, limiting their role to immune defense. However, recent discoveries have revealed that neutrophils represent a highly heterogeneous immune cell population, across diverse microenvironments. They are referred to as tumor-associated neutrophils when recruited to the tumor microenvironment. Initially, tumor-associated neutrophils were believed to primarily promote tumor growth and metastasis. Contrarily, emerging evidence indicates that tumor-associated neutrophils exhibit anti-tumor functions under specific conditions, acting as inhibitors during the initial growth or metastatic phases of lung cancer. This functional heterogeneity positions neutrophils as a promising focus for novel approaches to lung cancer immunotherapy. This review aims to explore the role of tumor-associated neutrophils in lung cancer progression and to investigate responses in the context of tumor control, thereby deepening the understanding of neutrophil function in lung cancer.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The nutritional needs of preterm newborns (PTNB) are increased and enhancing nutritional management is essential to meet them. The addition of multicomponent additive (MA) to human milk (HM) is used as a treatment strategy. The objective of the research is to analyze the association between the use of MA added to HM with nutritional and clinical outcomes in low-birth weight PTNB admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods
Prospective cohort study with PTNB weighing less than 2500 g during hospitalization in the NICU, who were divided into two distinct groups based on the presence or absence of MA supplementation. We investigated outcomes related to nutritional status at discharge, length of stay, presence of metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP), extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) and encouragement of breastfeeding at discharge.
Results
A total of 65 PTNB were included. We found that the lower the BW, the more often the use of MA was observed (p = 0.006). At discharge, there was a decline in z- scores, in which 46 % of PTNB who used MA developed malnutrition. The length of stay was longer in the group of PTNB who used MA (p < 0.001). The percentage of PTNB with MBDP who used MA (52.5 %) was higher than the percentage of those who did not use it (p = 0.006). The probability of PTNB with MBDP using MA is 2.65 times higher than those without MDBP.
Conclusion
The use of MA to HM did not prevent or avoid the decline in nutritional status of the PTNBs, considering that those who used it had greater difficulty gaining weight, longer hospital stays, and more MBPD diagnoses compared to the group that did not use supplementation. However, the MA was crucial as it provided essential nutritional support for those PTNB who are more susceptible to MBDP.}

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the most recent LLMs—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash—in yielding correct answers to questions related to soil science, a fundamental discipline in agricultural, natural resources, and environmental sciences. For this purpose, 105 specialized multiple-choice questions covering all domains of soil science were selected from the Iranian national PhD entrance exam in soil science. The GPT-4o-based chatbot, also known as ChatGPT, was employed to translate questions from Persian into English to assess the impact of input language on its performance. The LLMs were compared using Cohen's Kappa coefficient and the Chi-Square test. The study results indicated that the overall performance of chatbots powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o was comparable, as both models correctly answered 64.80 % of the questions. Nevertheless, these chatbots had significantly higher answering accuracy than Gemini 1.5 Pro and cost-efficient LLMs, namely Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that soil science questions could be categorized as complex tasks for chatbots. The GPT-4o model's performance in answering questions was not significantly dependent on the language used (p > 0.05), revealing that input language is not a limiting factor when applying ChatGPT to soil science. Overall, AI chatbots can, at best, achieve slightly above-moderate performance in answering soil science questions. The study highlights the importance of soil scientists' knowledge and experience in integrating AI chatbots into soil science research and education.}

It is important to design and optimize the geometry of architected materials within a wide search space. This study integrates Voronoi tessellation and informatics to construct architected materials informatics for geometry optimization. Voronoi tessellation can design diverse architected materials by dividing a design space with bisecting planes between arbitrarily arranged seed points and replacing the bisecting plane edges with solid struts. The neural network surrogate model predicts the properties of the architected materials based on the seed point coordinates and the strut radius. The genetic algorithm inversely analyzes the surrogate model to optimize the seed point coordinates and strut radius directly linked to the optimized architected material geometry. This framework rapidly optimized the geometry of cellular-structured heat sinks, optimally balancing pressure loss and heat transfer (Pareto front) under forced convection. The optimized geometry of the Pareto front was validated using computational fluid dynamics and experiments. In addition, the data obtained during the optimization was analyzed to develop a strategy to improve the pressure loss and heat transfer trade-off. This study provides architected materials informatics framework to optimize the geometry of architected materials for diverse applications.}

It explores how GAI affects both senders’ ability to create salient messages and receivers’ costs of absorbing them. The analysis reveals that while GAI can increase communication by reducing costs, it may also disrupt traditional signalling mechanisms. In a salience model, GAI generally improves outcomes but can potentially reduce receiver welfare. In a pure signalling model, GAI may hinder effective communication by making it harder to distinguish high-quality messages. This suggests that GAI’s introduction necessitates new instruments and mechanisms to facilitate effective communication and quality assessment in this evolving landscape.}

In domains such as urban dynamics, environmental monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems, predictive models must effectively integrate heterogeneous data sources while maintaining transparency in decision making. This paper introduces a novel Two-Stage Attention Integrated Graph-Based Multi-source Spatio-Temporal Data Fusion Network (2S-AGMSTDF) that leverages generative AI-enhanced representations to improve both prediction accuracy and model interpretability. In the first stage, we perform external feature embedding using an Augmented Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (AKGCN), spatial feature embedding via a GCN-ResNet-based Cross-Modality Transformer (GRCMT), and temporal feature embedding using an Attention-Based LSTM. The second stage fuses the learned embeddings through a Sparse Attentive Backtracking LSTM, enabling the model to trace influential patterns across modalities and time steps. This architecture allows for effective fusion of diverse data types, such as environmental indicators, mobility patterns, and auxiliary data such as traffic flow and point-of-interest (POI) information. The proposed method demonstrates how generative AI techniques can improve both the quality of the representation and the fusion process across modalities, enabling scalable and interpretable predictions in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets validate the superiority of 2S-AGMSTDF in terms of predictive performance and model transparency, making it a strong candidate for GenAI-based information fusion applications.}

The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies’ abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters). We conclude that machine learning algorithms can be trained and used to classify abstracts for their eligibility, significantly reducing the workload for the researchers without diminishing objectivity and quality when updating systematic literature reviews with or without a meta-analysis.}

abstract = {Background
Pyloromyotomy is a clean surgical procedure with a low risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). Despite this, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is often administered, raising concerns about unnecessary antibiotic exposure and antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether SAP reduces SSI rates in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and to propose a guideline for selective SAP omission.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Infants undergoing pyloromyotomy between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 were included. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included stratified rates of superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space SSIs.
Results
Among 4917 infants (age <1 year; 84.26 % male), 49.48 % received SAP. Additionally, 81 patients (1.65 %) received post-operative antibiotics beyond the intraoperative period. The overall SSI rate was 1.42 %, primarily comprised of superficial SSIs. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between infants receiving SAP (1.15 %) and those not receiving SAP (1.69 %) (p = 0.110). The rate of unplanned readmission and unplanned return to the operating room within 30 days was 2.44 % and 1.04 %, respectively, with no significant difference between those who received post-operative antibiotics and those who did not (p > 0.2 for both comparisons).
Conclusions
Routine SAP administration in pyloromyotomy is unnecessary given the low risk of SSIs. SAP in ASA Class I or II infants undergoing isolated pyloromyotomy without mucosal perforation, immune-compromising conditions, infections, or trauma should be omitted. These findings support efforts to optimize antibiotic stewardship in pediatric surgical practice.

In this study, a green, efficient, and cost-effective tactic was creatively proposed so that the aerated liquid fraction of digestate (aerated-LFD) could be employed to pretreat corn straw. The influence of aerated-LFD post different aeration intervals (10 min, 60 min, 120 min) and aerated-LFD without aeration on the biomethane production of corn straw were compared. The results show that the lignocellulosic array structure was disrupted, promoting microbial attachment and releasing soluble organic matter crucial for methane production. Methane production performance was better in all aerated-LFD groups than in the liquid fraction of digestate (LFD) and control group. The methane production of corn straw pretreated by 120 min aerated-LFD was the highest, which was 198.23 mL/gVS, 40.05 % higher than the untreated corn straw, together with a 67 % lag time reduction. The coupling model could well explain the kinetic behavior during anaerobic digestion of corn straw. These findings highlight the potential of aerated-LFD pretreatment as a sustainable bioenergy production strategy, offering insights into meeting energy needs while mitigating environmental impacts.}

abstract = {Medical image generation has recently garnered significant interest among researchers. However, the primary generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), often encounter challenges during training, including mode collapse. To address these issues, we proposed the AE-COT-GAN model (Autoencoder-based Conditional Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network) for the generation of medical images belonging to specific categories. The training process of our model comprises three fundamental components. The training process of our model encompasses three fundamental components. First, we employ an autoencoder model to obtain a low-dimensional manifold representation of real images. Second, we apply extended semi-discrete optimal transport to map Gaussian noise distribution to the latent space distribution and obtain corresponding labels effectively. This procedure leads to the generation of new latent codes with known labels. Finally, we integrate a GAN to train the decoder further to generate medical images. To evaluate the performance of the AE-COT-GAN model, we conducted experiments on two medical image datasets, namely DermaMNIST and BloodMNIST. The model’s performance was compared with state-of-the-art generative models. Results show that the AE-COT-GAN model had excellent performance in generating medical images. Moreover, it effectively addressed the common issues associated with traditional GANs.}

abstract = {Introduction: In an era where technological advancements in large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT continually redefine the boundaries of medicine, the advent of Amazon Web Services (AWS) HealthScribe on July 26th, 2023, heralds a transformative moment in healthcare. This HIPAA-eligible generative AI service, capable of transcribing patient-provider conversations and automatically entering them into an electronic health record (EHR) system, represents a profound intersection of technology and medical practice. As this technology permeates clinical settings, addressing associated patient concerns with AI becomes paramount. Although providers may grasp the intricacies of such technology swiftly, patients are likely to harbor concerns. Patients may be unfamiliar with the technology or question its safety. Clear and precise communication will be essential for physicians to ease patient concerns. Our team interviewed forty-eight subjects to survey their understanding, concerns, and opinions on artificial intelligence. We then classified and visually charted their responses. Based on our data, we created a framework for ethical communication physicians can follow when talking to patients about using artificial intelligence in clinical settings. Method: A multidisciplinary team encompassing physicians, advanced practice providers specializing in hematology and oncology, and bioethicists engaged with forty-eight subjects. The study population represented a diverse cross-section of society, differing in aspects such as age, sex assigned at birth, political orientation, education, income, ethnicity, occupation, and religious affiliation. Our investigative process included a structured interview containing twenty-five foundational questions. No personal health information was collected during the questionnaire, and all questions sought only to garner subject opinion. Questions were designed to probe areas of interest such as: (1) the subject's general feelings about AI in healthcare, (2) their familiarity with AI technologies, (3) the existence of any specific concerns, and (4) a deeper exploration of those concerns. The responses were meticulously collected, categorized, and analyzed to discern emergent trends. Results: Our team developed The TRUST Framework based on our research findings by identifying and addressing the three primary concerns with AI in healthcare; transparency, confidentiality, and consent. The data presented a mosaic of varied opinions, with minimal discernible trends correlating with specific demographic attributes. One of the subtle patterns identified pertained to age. Subjects within the 12-35 age bracket demonstrated a familiarity with artificial intelligence, generally expressing indifference rather than concern or enthusiasm. Those aged 35-65 exhibited greater pronounced indifference than any age demographic and revealed an unfamiliarity with existing artificial intelligence tools. Conversely, respondents aged 65 and older expressed the highest level of concern and a prevalent unfamiliarity with the range of available artificial intelligence applications. Conclusion: Effective communication when introducing the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings is imperative. This conclusion is based on abstract reasoning and rooted in real-world feedback received from a diverse subject population. Our research revealed that subjects have varying feelings and concerns with artificial intelligence, irrespective of their background. Therefore, avoiding unconscious bias and having a framework for communicating how AI will be used is essential. As the frontier of AI continues to expand, the need for ethical and transparent communication will only grow. This study serves as a call to action for healthcare providers to commit to clear, honest, and empathetic communication about AI's role in patient care. Doing so will promote the overall acceptance of AI in healthcare, subsequently enhancing patient outcomes and alleviating patient concerns by building trust.}

abstract = {As a result of the “publish or perish” environment for biomedical journal authors, as well as new developments in open access publication models (“pay to publish”) and rapid improvements in artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT), troubling trends and a propensity for ethical violations now exist. Credit is commonly being taken for authorship by those who fail to meet authorial criteria, which is unethical. Experienced coauthors are providing inadequate diligence in drafting, critical review, and final approval of submitted articles, which is unethical or, at the very least, careless. Research lacking originality (“copycat” studies) is becoming common, which although not unethical, is uninteresting and creates a burden for journal reviewers, editors, and, most of all, readers. Publication of least publishable units (LPU or “salami slicing”), where authors divide a single research publication into a number of papers with small amounts of information in each paper, results in quantity rather than quality and is ethically inappropriate. LPU can result in redundancy, self-plagiarism, publication overlap, and duplicate reporting of patient data that can result in inaccurate conclusions in systematic reviews. Duplicate submission of a paper to more than one journal (in the same or different languages), such that the paper is under peer review by multiple journals at the same time is unethical and can result in two or more journals publishing the same article. Duplicate publication (publication of a paper that overlaps substantially with one already published), without clear reference to the previous publication is unethical. Predatory journals, with low standards of quality or peer review, and predatory practices by publishers and owners of ostensibly nonpredatory journals, can result in solicitation and acceptance of articles (as well as author publication charges or fees) for the purpose of generating revenue, rather than for legitimate editorial reasons based on article quality and content. This is unethical. Opportunities exist to mitigate against these trends, and by naming these trends and identifying opportunities to avoid ethical transgression, our well-intentioned community can publish our scholarship in an unimpeachable manner.}

And refrigerant is widely employed in low and medium grade energy utilization and heating ventilation and air conditioning. The refrigerant mixtures can effectively combine the advantages of their components, which plays a key role in decarbonization. As a basic thermophysical property, critical temperature, Tc, plays an important role in thermodynamic calculation and thermodynamics system design. In this work, the structure-property relationship models of Tc for binary refrigerants were established by developing predictive models based on 61 binary refrigerants with 275 sets of experimental Tc data and six machine learning algorithms. Also, specific halogenated groups of refrigerants are used to characterize the components and molecular structures of binary mixtures. The Multiple-layer Perceptron model owns the best fitting and generalization ability with the average deviation is lower than 2 ​%. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed model does not rely on any experimental property data or empirical parameters, and can accurately predict Tc of binary refrigerant mixtures directly from their components and mixing ratios. The present work could be guided in building predictive models for other properties, thereby supporting the development of novel refrigerant mixtures.}

Grounded in Porter’s Five Forces framework—specifically the threat of substitutes—this commentary explores whether AI can adequately fulfill the complex and relational functions of pharmacists in delivering patient care. Drawing from foundational definitions of pharmaceutical care and economic theories of substitution, the paper examines both historical and emerging competitors to pharmacist-provided services, including physicians, nurses, and now AI-powered tools. Rather than assert a binary conclusion about AI’s ability to replace pharmacists, this paper identifies conditions under which substitution may be more or less likely. Key factors include the nature of the pharmaceutical care service, patient preferences, the quality and accessibility of AI tools, and regulatory and institutional constraints. Using examples from practice and education, the commentary highlights areas where AI may function as a substitute—such as information delivery or curricular mapping—and others where human oversight remains essential. Ultimately, the question is not whether AI will serve as a substitute, but to what extent, under what circumstances, and with what implications for pharmacy educators. Preparing students for a professional environment augmented by AI requires a shift in educational strategies, with a focus on adaptability, data literacy, and meaningful integration of emerging technologies.}

Here we present a case of a 4-month-old female with new onset infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) with initial etiology concerned for congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) due to a positive urine CMV PCR and maternal viral syndrome during pregnancy. Her brain MRI was significant for type 1 lissencephaly without other radiographical features of cCMV. The patient initially responded to high dose Prednisolone but had relapse of spasms at 9-month-old and required an ACTH course. She later developed generalized tonic seizures and focal impaired awareness seizures. Subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES) trio revealed a de novo PAFAH1B1 (c.405G > A, p.W135*) heterozygous nonsense variant which is pathogenic and thus solved the diagnostic puzzle. This case demonstrates that the absence of cCMV stigmata should raise concern for alternative etiology in cases of lissencephaly and the importance of genetic evaluation for subsequent management and family counseling.}

However, much of the current literature on psychopathy impairment appears mixed in findings, varying by the traits examined and measured outcomes. The current paper aims to contribute to this field of research by examining how a triarchic model of psychopathy relates to a wide variety of potential consequences, including impairment, personality functioning, interpersonal functioning, internalizing, and perceived quality of life. Through two studies utilizing the Triarchic psychopathy model in undergraduate samples, significant psychopathy impairment was identified. Broadly, disinhibition was related to the most significant impairments across functioning domains. Boldness was more variable and elicited both positive (e.g., higher quality of life, lower self-harm) and negative (impairments in empathy and intimacy) outcomes. Meanness was primarily related to interpersonal difficulties; however, differences in measuring meanness led to different findings on its connection to personality functioning. By better understanding the consequences of psychopathy and how they vary by dimensional traits, interventions can be better tailored to alleviate both individual and societal suffering.}

However, regulatory, ethical, and technical challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective implementation. Bias in AI can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, while the “black-box problem” raises concerns about transparency and trust. Ethical principles must guide AI integration, particularly regarding patient safety, accountability, and liability. Privacy risks related to data collection and security are especially critical in ophthalmology, where large imaging datasets are essential. Additionally, AI-generated inaccuracies, or “hallucinations,” pose potential risks to clinical decision-making. Cybersecurity threats targeting AI-powered healthcare systems further emphasize the need for robust protections. Despite these challenges, AI has the potential to improve access to ophthalmic care, particularly in underserved regions, as seen in AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening. However, financial and infrastructural barriers remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among stakeholders, including regulators, healthcare providers, AI developers, and policymakers, to establish clear guidelines and promote trustworthy AI systems. This review explores key regulatory and ethical concerns and highlights strategies to ensure the responsible integration of AI into ophthalmology.}

Mental health is an important public health issue in China, compounded by a shortage in psychiatric services. Against this backdrop, digital technologies could offer solutions. Digital mental health interventions use technologies, such as smartphone applications, to improve mental health outcomes. Although there has been a drastic increase in mental health mobile apps available in recent years, current evidence-based digital interventions for mental health are scarce and seldom evaluated for effectiveness and implementation in China. In this Viewpoint, we review digital mental health interventions in China and propose a framework that could guide the development of culturally sensitive digital mental health innovations, with the adoption of co-creation and community engagement strategies. We also provide recommendations to address issues related to usage, interventions, and implementation to improve health equity and implementation of digital mental health interventions in the Chinese context.}

The nanopores and hills, at different etching conditions, were found to have higher surface area as well as enough space to possess highly populated SERS-active sites. For short term etching in MCEE technique, the vertical etching was found to be dominant making the nanostructures narrow, whereas for long term etching pore size increased due to accelerated top lateral etching. It was noted that smaller Ag-NCs with the size distribution of 29.04±5.69 nm were observed within eSi-NSs of shorter etching time, whereas comparatively bigger Ag-NCs with the size distribution of 51.36±11.21 nm were observed within those of longer etching time. Strong SERS-activity was observed in presence of Ag-NCs-decorated eSi-NSs using Rhodamine 6G. The SERS-enhancement was noted to be as high as 1 × 106. SERS enhancements in presence of eSi-NSs with shorted etching time was noted to be nearly double of those with longer etching time. EM near-field distributions derived from finite difference time domain simulations validated the observations as well. A plausible explanation and correlation with the experimental observations have been amended.}

abstract = {Accurate prediction of postoperative vault, the distance between the implantable collamer lens (ICL) posterior surface and the crystalline lens anterior surface, is critical for the success of ICL surgery. Existing regression-based prediction methods fail to provide visual postoperative observations, which are essential for a comprehensive risk assessment. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of anterior segment structures. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of using the generative adversarial network to predict postoperative AS-OCT images and quantify the clinical parameter. Given the direct contact between the iris posterior surface and ICL anterior surface, the iris critically influences ICL positioning. Motivated by this, we propose a Prior Anatomical Knowledge-guided GAN (PAK-GAN) to enable both accurate vault prediction and visual observation of postoperative anterior segment structures. Specifically, the Iris morphology perception Auxiliary Branches (IAB) are designed to capture the context of the iris position and shape. Additionally, we incorporate a Gaussian weight map into the loss function to strengthen the model’s attention around the iris root region. To validate the performance of our method, we collected paired pre- and post-operative ICL images from multiple hospitals. Comprehensive ablation experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show that our PAK-GAN achieves the best prediction accuracy for vault and iris position. Furthermore, compared to two clinically used postoperative vault prediction methods, NK-formula and KS-formula, our approach shows the best correlation and agreement with the achieved vault.}

abstract = {The frequent appearance of clouds, particularly thick clouds, in optical Remote Sensing (RS) images significantly restricts the continued use of RS images. The current multi-temporal cloud removal models have two drawbacks when the cloud occlusion ratio varies substantially across the temporals. The first is the static processing for temporals with varying cloud occlusion ratios, and the second is the lack of a dynamic adaptive mechanism for adjusting the prompt intensity acrosstemporals. A novel dynamic deep-learning model with a two-stage coarse-to-fine network framework (ACA-Net) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, which incorporates three main modules to accomplish adaptive processing: (1) a Self-Attention Adaptive K module, which dynamically adjusts the proportion of attention maps according to cloud occlusion ratios, balancing effectiveness and efficiency, (2) an Adaptive High-Low Frequency module, which selectively emphasizes frequency components to improve detail recovery and structural consistency, and (3) an Adaptive Temporal Prompt module, which adaptively modulates prompt intensity across temporals to enhance cross-temporal information fusion. Extensive experiments on our cloud removal datasets demonstrate that ACA-Net significantly outperforms five typical cloud removal modules in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Importantly, ACA-Net maintains strong cloud removal performance even when cloud occlusion ratios vary greatly across the three temporal inputs. Compared with the latest DiffCR model, ACA-Net achieves a 34.2 % PSNR improvement and a 13.0 % SSIM improvement, while requiring 89.4 % fewer parameters. These results highlight ACA-Net’s effectiveness and efficiency in thick cloud removal. The source code of ACA-Net model can be accessed at https://github.com/BaopuHou/ACA-Net.}

Background
Anorectal malformations (ARM) are often accompanied by urological anomalies, which can contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of kidney and urinary tract anomalies, as well as bladder dysfunction, and their potential impact on the development of CKD in children with ARM.
Study design
This single-center, retrospective study included 175 children with ARM, after excluding 75 children with missing data. Clinical and radiological findings and serum creatinine levels were obtained from medical records. Anorectal malformations were classified as “high” and “low” type based on the Wingspread classification, and also further classified by fistula type and sex distribution according to the Krickenbeck International Classification. CKD was defined and staged according to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines.
Results
The median age of the patients was 9.7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.13:1. Among the 175 patients, 97 (55 %) had intermediate or low-type ARM, and 78 (45 %) had high-type ARM. Kidney and/or urinary tract anomalies were identified in 85 patients (48.5 %), with 63 having kidney anomalies and 71 having urinary tract anomalies. The most common urinary tract anomaly was vesicoureteral reflux (n = 58). Bladder dysfunction was observed in 56 patients (32 %). CKD was diagnosed in 30 patients (17 %); six of them were in CKD stage 5, and the remaining 24 were in stages 2–4. The development of CKD was more common in both females and males with kidney anomalies (p < 0.001), urinary tract anomalies (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), bladder dysfunction (p < 0.001), urinary tract infection (p < 0.001), in addition females with persistent cloaca (p = 0.023) and spinal anomalies (p = 0.013). Kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction were independently associated with the development of CKD (p < 0.001 and p = 0.046, respectively).
Discussion
This study highlights that approximately half of the children with ARM had kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and one-third had bladder dysfunction. Additionally, almost one-fifth of the patients developed CKD, mostly in the early stages. Our findings also suggest that both kidney anomalies and bladder dysfunction are significant risk factors for CKD development in children with ARM.
Conclusion
This study emphasizes the presence of kidney anomalies, along with bladder dysfunction as risk factors for CKD. Physicians should take care to monitor and manage these risks to minimize the long-term impacts on kidney health in children with ARM.}

Prevention focuses on reducing these immune cells through leukoreduction and irradiation. While leukoreduction of blood components decreases white blood cell content and improves overall transfusion safety, it does not fully prevent TA-GVHD, as viable T cells may persist. Irradiation using gamma or X-ray methods remain the most effective strategy, inactivating donor T cells by inducing DNA damage and suppressing proliferation. However, it also compromises red blood cell quality by increasing hemolysis, oxidative injury, membrane damage, extracellular potassium, and reducing storage duration. As an alternative, hypothermic storage of leukoreduced red blood cells is gaining attention. Evidence suggests that extending storage beyond 21 days significantly reduces T cell viability and proliferation without compromising red blood cell integrity. Further research is needed to directly compare the efficacy of hypothermic storage to irradiation.}

abstract = {Background
The purpose of our study was to develop a novel magnetic resonance imaging classification system to predict the progression of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TONFH) in young adults and assess its clinical implications.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2007 to December 2022, including 134 hips (134 patients, mean age 41 years (range, 21 to 43), 65.7% men) diagnosed with TONFH at Association Research Circulation Osseous Stage I. The bone repair band (BRB) classification system categorized lesions into Superficial (Type S), Uncertain (Type U), and Extensive (Type E) based on magnetic resonance imaging coronal views. Patients were followed with observational treatment and x-ray assessments. Radiographic signs and femoral head collapse were evaluated during follow-up. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between BRB classification and disease progression.
Results
The 134 hips were categorized into Type S (n = 54), Type U (n = 21), and Type E (n = 59). Over a mean follow-up of 39.6 months, radiographic signs were most prevalent in Type E (94.9%) and least in Type S (9.3%), with median times to radiographic signs of 18 months for Type U and 16 months for Type E. Femoral head collapse occurred in 50.8% of Type E, 23.8% of Type U, and none in Type S, with a median time to collapse of 34 months for Type E. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified BRB classification as an independent predictor of disease progression, with Type E showing the highest risk for adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
The newly proposed BRB classification provides a systematic approach to assessing necrotic lesion severity in TONFH and demonstrates significant correlation with femoral head collapse risk. Future studies are needed to further validate its clinical significance and explore the anatomical basis underlying this classification.}

However, cell processing facilities (CPFs) still heavily rely on manual operations by cell processing operators (CPOs). The intricate nature of cell culture and stringent sterility requirements impose a considerable psychological burden on CPOs, particularly the risk of cell contamination. This study delves into the psychological aspects experienced by CPOs in relation to the risk of contamination during cell culture. An online survey was conducted across 47 sites to investigate concerns regarding contamination and the strategies implemented to mitigate contamination risk in cell processing facilities. The survey findings revealed that 72 % of operators expressed concern about contamination, with 18 % reporting direct experiences of contamination. This indicates that the perceived contamination risk in CPFs is higher than the actual reported incidents. Furthermore, this study examines operational practices, such as material handling, and the utilization of biological safety cabinets (BSCs). The results highlight variations in BSC utilization and material handling practices, underscoring potential operational challenges. Implementing risk assessments and leveraging evidence-based data at each site could help address these challenges and alleviate the psychological strain on CPOs. This, in turn, would enhance the quality of cell therapy products and improve the well-being of CPOs.}

abstract = {Introduction
Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has biomechanical advantages but is associated with increased intraoperative bleeding. The role of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing postoperative joint haemarthrosis and improving the short-term outcomes of double-bundle ACLR has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the effects of intraoperative TXA on postoperative joint haemarthrosis and short-term functional outcomes in patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included 80 male patients who underwent double-bundle ACLR between January 2019 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two groups: those who received TXA and those that did not. The TXA group received 50 mL of TXA (10 mg/mL) intravenously approximately 10 min before tourniquet release, followed by an intra-articular injection of 50 mL TXA (10 mg/mL) immediately after wound closure, prior to tourniquet release, whereas the control group did not receive TXA. Primary outcomes included postoperative haemarthrosis volume, assessed using Coupens and Yate (CY) values; and short-term functional recovery, evaluated using range of motion (ROM), quadriceps strength, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores on day 1, day 15, week 6, and week 12 postoperatively.
Results
Intraoperative administration of TXA in patients undergoing double-bundle ACLR reduced postoperative haemarthrosis, as measured by a lower CY value on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.004) and day 15 (P < 0.001). Compared to patients in the control group, patients in the TXA group reported lower VAS pain scores on day 1 (P < 0.001), day 15 (P < 0.001), and week 6 (P = 0.028), together with improved quadriceps strength (P = 0.043, day 1; P = 0.009, day 15) and ROM (P < 0.001, 12 weeks postoperatively) during the early postoperative period.
Conclusion
The use of TXA during double-bundle ACLR may reduce postoperative joint haemarthrosis and enhance short-term functional outcomes.}

abstract = {The ability to use digital technologies effectively is unevenly distributed among adolescents. Youths from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, girls, and migrants frequently exhibit lower digital competencies, which can contribute to long-term educational and occupational disadvantages. To design educational strategies that promote digital equity, it is essential to understand when and for whom these inequalities emerge. This longitudinal study examined the development of social, gender, and migration-related disparities in digital competencies during adolescence. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (N = 4872), we examined digital competencies that were assessed three times between ages 12 and 18 with standardized achievement tests. Latent growth curve analyses revealed distinct developmental patterns: socioeconomic disparities were initially large (Cohen's d = −0.22) but decreased over time (Cohen's d = −0.16); gender differences favoring boys were small at first (Cohen's d = 0.07) but widened during adolescence (Cohen's d = 0.18); and the migrant gap was already substantial in early adolescence (Cohen's d = −0.18) and remained stable later on. Comparative analyses for math and reading literacy highlighted partial parallels between digital inequalities and traditional educational inequalities. Overall, the results indicated persistent social, gender, and migration-related disparities in digital competencies throughout adolescence. Because these gaps remained considerable in later adolescence, they appear insufficiently addressed by the current educational system. To reduce digital inequalities, educational interventions may need to begin even before adolescence and target younger children in order to prevent disparities from becoming firmly established.}

We utilized data with tens of thousands of alloy materials from the Materials Project (MP) and Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery (AFLOW) databases. Without any experimental voltage input, we identified over 30 alloy systems that have been experimentally validated with good precision. Additionally, we predicted over 100 alloy anodes with low potential and high specific capacity.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into medical education, with transformative potential for learning and assessment. However, their performance across diverse medical exams globally has remained underexplored.
Objective
This study aims to introduce MedExamLLM, a comprehensive platform designed to systematically evaluate the performance of LLMs on medical exams worldwide. Specifically, the platform seeks to (1) compile and curate performance data for diverse LLMs on worldwide medical exams; (2) analyze trends and disparities in LLM capabilities across geographic regions, languages, and contexts; and (3) provide a resource for researchers, educators, and developers to explore and advance the integration of artificial intelligence in medical education.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted on April 25, 2024, in the PubMed database to identify relevant publications. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed, English-language, original research articles that evaluated at least one LLM on medical exams. Exclusion criteria included review articles, non-English publications, preprints, and studies without relevant data on LLM performance. The screening process for candidate publications was independently conducted by 2 researchers to ensure accuracy and reliability. Data, including exam information, data process information, model performance, data availability, and references, were manually curated, standardized, and organized. These curated data were integrated into the MedExamLLM platform, enabling its functionality to visualize and analyze LLM performance across geographic, linguistic, and exam characteristics. The web platform was developed with a focus on accessibility, interactivity, and scalability to support continuous data updates and user engagement.
Results
A total of 193 articles were included for final analysis. MedExamLLM comprised information for 16 LLMs on 198 medical exams conducted in 28 countries across 15 languages from the year 2009 to the year 2023. The United States accounted for the highest number of medical exams and related publications, with English being the dominant language used in these exams. The Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) series models, especially GPT-4, demonstrated superior performance, achieving pass rates significantly higher than other LLMs. The analysis revealed significant variability in the capabilities of LLMs across different geographic and linguistic contexts.
Conclusions
MedExamLLM is an open-source, freely accessible, and publicly available online platform providing comprehensive performance evaluation information and evidence knowledge about LLMs on medical exams around the world. The MedExamLLM platform serves as a valuable resource for educators, researchers, and developers in the fields of clinical medicine and artificial intelligence. By synthesizing evidence on LLM capabilities, the platform provides valuable insights to support the integration of artificial intelligence into medical education. Limitations include potential biases in the data source and the exclusion of non-English literature. Future research should address these gaps and explore methods to enhance LLM performance in diverse contexts.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
In the past decade, the increasing availability and prevalence of fentanyl in the drug supply have heightened the risk of fatal overdose and increased the frequency and severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms. We aimed to examine how opioid withdrawal impacts engagement in harm reduction behaviors among people who use drugs.
Methods
Data came from a community-based research study in Baltimore, Maryland, conducted from 2022 to 2024. Participants were adults who used heroin, fentanyl, or prescription opiates to get high in the past month (N = 676). Structured surveys assessed withdrawal as a barrier to testing drugs for potency and overdose prevention. Logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of engagement in harm reduction during periods of withdrawal.
Results
Half the sample (46.6 %) reported that withdrawal “always” or “often” prevented them from testing drugs, and 66.6 % agreed that withdrawal was a barrier to overdose prevention. Depression symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.56, 95 % CI 1.09–2.25), increased opioid use per week (aOR: 1.12, 95 % CI 1.03–1.22), and White race (aOR: 1.75, 95 % CI 1.16–2.62) were independently associated with lower engagement in drug testing and overdose prevention during withdrawal.
Conclusions
Withdrawal significantly impacts engagement in harm reduction behaviors, even among those with high awareness and receptivity to drug testing and overdose prevention strategies. Withdrawal management and mental health support are emergent and critical components for harm reduction interventions to prevent overdose morbidity and mortality among people who use drugs.}

abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis because it can characterize tissue based on contrast agent kinetics. Conventional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including both early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scanning times that can cause patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and contribute to higher costs and limited availability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive pipeline for synthesizing long-term (late-phase) contrast-enhanced breast MRI images from short-term (early-phase) counterparts, aiming to replicate the behavior of the time-intensity (TI) curve in enhanced regions while maintaining visual properties across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a new loss function called the Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), which leverages the temporal behavior of the contrast agent to guide the training of a generative model. Furthermore, as established normalization strategies show undesirable effects on the enhancement behavior, a novel normalization strategy (TI-norm) is also proposed, which preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps. Additionally, two new metrics are proposed to evaluate the synthesized image quality, i.e., the Contrast agent Pattern score (CPs), which determines the validity of annotated regions according to their enhancement patterns (plateau, persistent, washout), and the average difference in enhancement (ED), which quantifies the difference between the real and generated enhancement in selected regions. Evaluation was performed using a public DCE-MRI dataset that includes studies from 3T and 1.5T scanners with different imaging techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method accurately synthesizes the contrast enhancement response in terms of the TI curve in regions of interest and significantly outperforms other models, while maintaining visual properties comparable to real late-phase contrast-enhanced images. By enabling accurate synthesis of late-phase contrast-enhanced images from early-phase data, our method has the potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols, reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This advancement brings generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios, enhancing efficiency in breast cancer imaging.}

Because academic research on the integration of artificial intelligence and ideological and political education is lacking, the progress in practical applications is slow. To address this gap, this study took disciplinary system theory as the analytical framework, knowledge sociology as the theoretical perspective, and the Chinese literature database as the source, using data visualization software CiteSpaceVI to examine the knowledge production situation in the combination of artificial intelligence and ideological and political education in China. Through word segmentation technology and cluster analysis, this study found that research in this field began in 2018 and peaked in 2021 and 2023; scholars from more than 10 different disciplines participated in the research, and five stable research areas were formed. This field of study received support from 45 national funds and 29 funds from the Ministry of Education, along with various provincial fund projects. As a result, there are many urgent issues in this field waiting for more in-depth research and exploration in the future.}

abstract = {Purpose
Epidural analgesia (EA) is commonly employed for postoperative pain management in children undergoing abdominal tumor resection. Indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) often remain for the duration of EA administration due to concern for associated urinary retention. This study focuses on children undergoing abdominal tumor resection with appropriate EA coverage, to assess whether IUC can be removed early with minimal risk of reinsertion for urinary retention.
Methods
A retrospective review of children who underwent abdominal tumor resections with EA between 2015 and 2023 at two institutions was conducted. Data were summarized, and rates of postoperative urinary retention requiring catheter reinsertion and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) were compared between patients with early and late IUC removal groups using Fisher's exact testing. “Early” was defined as IUC removal with EA in place and “late” as IUC removal after or concurrent with EA discontinuation.
Results
A total of 228 children underwent abdominal tumor resections with EA. Of these, 104 had early, and 124 had late IUC removal. The average postoperative day (POD) of IUC removal in the early group was 1.1±0.5 days and 2.9±1.1 days in the late group. EA was at T12 level or higher in 101 patients (97.1 %) in the early group, and 68 (54.8 %) in the late group (p<0.001). EA contained opioids in 27 (26.0 %) in the early group and 54 (43.5 %) in the late group (p=0.005). There were 6 (5.8 %) children in the early group and 1 (0.8 %) in the late group requiring re-catheterization (p = 0.049). For those requiring re-catheterization, the EA level was T7-8 in 5 patients, T10-11 in 1 patient, and T4 in 1 patient (late). There was 1 (1.0 %) patient with a CAUTI in the early group, and 3 (2.4 %) patients in the late group (p = 0.63).
Conclusions
Early removal of indwelling urinary catheters in the setting of thoracic epidural analgesia is associated with a small risk of urinary retention necessitating catheter re-insertion. Balancing the need for IUCs with this possibility, patient comfort, and infectious risk should inform decision-making to best align with enhanced recovery efforts.}

abstract = {AIM
Cervical lymphadenopathy can indicate various benign or malignant conditions. While ultrasound-guided core biopsy is commonly used for diagnosis, its effectiveness can vary. Our study aimed to determine factors that affect the diagnostic yield of this procedure, potentially guiding appropriate patient referrals towards either more invasive diagnostic procedures, such as open biopsy or less intensive approaches like ongoing follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective study was conducted evaluating ultrasound-guided core biopsies performed for cervical lymphadenopathy at a single institution. Imaging features and technical details were documented. Two radiologists collected data from formal procedure reports and recorded sonographic images. Data were then correlated with histopathologic reports.
RESULTS
The study included 136 patients with final diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disease (95 patients, 69.8%), reactive lymphadenopathy (24 patients, 17.6%), and carcinoma (17 patients, 12.5%). Twenty-four of the initial biopsies were nondiagnostic (17.6%), requiring diagnosis through surgery, follow-up, or repeated biopsy. Of the 24 nondiagnostic biopsies, 17 were eventually identified as reactive lymph nodes, and 7 harboured lymphoproliferative disease. All carcinoma cases were detected on the initial biopsy. Larger lymph node size correlated with higher diagnostic yield (P < 0.01). No correlation was found with needle gauge (P = 0.13), proximity to large vessels (P = 0.68), or overshoot potential (P = 0.26).
CONCLUSION
Our study results show that smaller lymph node size and the presence of a fatty hilum are correlated with reduced diagnostic yield. Patients with unfavourable characteristics should be considered for imaging surveillance, fine-needle aspiration (FNA), or an open biopsy.}

However, its effects on DNA damage are not well understood. This pilot study investigated the effects of music listening therapy on cortisol levels and DNA damage in children and adolescents with ASD.
Methods
Participants listened to a selection of classical music daily for 30 days. Cortisol levels and DNA damage (measured by micronucleus frequency and nuclear buds) were assessed before and after the intervention.
Results
After one month, the pilot study did not find a significant reduction in cortisol levels. However, music listening therapy was associated with a reduction in DNA damage, as evidenced by a decrease in micronucleus frequency.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that music listening therapy could be a promising non-pharmacological intervention for children and adolescents with ASD.}

Based on a PLS-SEM analysis performed to examine the outcomes of an online survey (N = 145), our study provides insights into the connections between changes in the teachers' identity, digital mastery, successful role transition, and the teacher-student relationship. Our results show that the loss of teaching identity has a direct negative impact on the digital mastery, the success of the transition of the teaching role, and the student-teacher relationship as well. We suggest that a transition process is successful if it is well-managed and supported during its psychological phases, places significant emphasis on the phenomenon of loss of identity and provides guidance towards defining the new identity.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
Deep learning technologies have demonstrated the ability to identify dyssynergic defecation for diagnosis of common gastrointestinal motility disorders through nuanced interpretation of 3-dimensional high-definition anal manometry (3D-HDAM). We aimed to validate a deep learning algorithm capable of spatiotemporal analysis of 3D-HDAM in a multicenter setting.
Methods
We included 1214 consecutive anorectal manometry studies performed across 3 large health care systems between 2018 and 2022. Deep learning results were compared with expert interpretation according to the London consensus protocol as reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using bootstrap sampling to calculate area under the curve (AUC). We used Wilcoxon tests to analyze how well the confidence scores from the deep learning model correlated with the likelihood that experts would assign ambiguous labels in cases where determinations were uncertain. Video-based deep learning features were clustered using Gaussian Mixture Modeling to reveal novel dyssynergia subtypes.
Results
The deep hybrid learning algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.99 (± 0.001 standard deviation), 0.90 ± 0.008, and 0.79 ± 0.003 at Dartmouth Health, Henry Ford Hospital, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, respectively, performance comparable or superior to solely deep learning or traditional modeling on every cohort. The algorithm appeared capable of reporting confidence aligned with manual expert interpretation of ambiguity (W = −20.50; P < .001; −1.73; P = .08; and −3.22; P = .001). We further identified 2 novel classes of dyssynergia patterns that may represent clinically relevant phenotypes of dyssynergia.
Conclusions
3D-HDAM combined with video-based deep learning is a useful and clinically relevant technology for evaluating anorectal dyssynergia. Future use cases can be expanded to evaluate other motility disorders and their treatment.}

In the proposed Bayesian statistical continuum mechanics theory, the nonlinear elastic potential energy is used as a prior in a Bayesian inference network, which can intelligently and inversely recover the detailed continuum deformation mappings with only the information on the shapes of the deformed and undeformed continuum body, without knowing the actual boundary conditions, including both traction and displacement boundary conditions, and the fine scale material constitutive relation. To solve the mixed variational problem, we developed an operator splitting or staggered algorithm that consists of a finite element (FE) step and a Bayesian learning (BL) step, analogous to the well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By solving the probabilistic Galerkin variational finite element problem, we demonstrated in several examples that the proposed method can inversely predict continuum nonlinear deformation mappings without requiring knowledge of the external load conditions. This long-sought-after inverse problem solution has been a significant challenge in the forensic pattern analysis of structural failures over the past several decades, and the proposed method provides a robust machine-intelligent solution.}

abstract = {Objectives
Numerous prior works have demonstrated the risk of clinical deterioration with movement and transport, and the higher the patient's acuity, the higher the risk and consequence of decompensation.
Methods
We performed a descriptive study of patients with a cardiac arrest during critical care transport (CCT) October 2020 through September 2022. Inclusion criteria included all patients with arrest after the arrival of the CCT team. To analyze factors associated with arrest, we performed a case-control study. Exclusion criteria included scene transports, pediatric patients, patients who did not arrest en route, and patients not transported.
Results
Over two years, 87 patients (0.7 %) had a cardiac arrest after arrival of the CCT team. The most common indications for transport were severe trauma, respiratory arrest, and aortic emergencies, and patients were commonly ED to ED transfers. In the case-control assessment, four variables were associated with arrest: mode of transport, OR 2.66 (95 % CI 1.05–6.75), number of vasopressors [1, OR 3.46 (95 % CI 1.05–11.39), 2, OR 6.67 (95 % CI 1.97–22.55), 3, OR 16.0, (95 % CI 3.77–68.0)], and initial MAP and SBP [both OR 0.98 (95 % CI 0.97–0.99)]. Of the 32 patients who arrested in transport, only 15 (46.9 %) had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
Conclusions
In a case-control assessment, four variables were associated with arrest in CCT: mode of transport, the number of vasopressors, the initial MAP, and the initial SBP. While cardiac arrest was uncommon, the rate of ROSC was only 46.9 %. Future work should build upon this work to determine thresholds for which patients are at the highest risk for arrest in transport.}

Estimating noncompliance and understanding its motivations is important for developing strategies to reduce illegality. In Chile, the socio-ecologically important kelp fishery (Lessonia spicata; L. berteorana) is suspected of having high levels of noncompliance. We estimated the levels and types of noncompliance within the fishery directly from small-scale fishers, along with exploring motivations for noncompliance. We did so across four different harvesting regulations, two management regimes, and two geographies. Levels of noncompliance differed across all three factors. Fishers have higher compliance in areas managed with territorial user rights management regimes compared to those managed by regional management plans that establish control rules. However, the differences were more pronounced in one geography compared to another. Fishers show high levels of normative and legitimacy-based motivations with respect to complying with kelp harvesting regulations. In contrast, instrumental motivations were weaker and more heterogenous, which may be tied to noncompliance. Results support the premise that a lack of enforcement may be the main driver of noncompliance in the Chilean kelp fishery. Thus, deterrent mechanisms such as enhancing the perceived likelihood of detection, improving surveillance methods, increasing penalties, and strengthening co-management governance through combining informal and formal mechanisms may help increase compliance.}

These methods need a novel and effective way of presentation for convenient comprehension and implementation. ‘Clinical algorithms’ is one such way, wherein a large amount of data is simplified, conceptual intricacies abstracted, and clinical application made easier. This article uses a modified version of the Horabin and Lewis algorithm to construct a clinical algorithm for Bhasma selection in the management of Pandu (anemia). The textual descriptions regarding the pathology and clinical presentations of Pandu have been compiled, and broadly classified, and the Bhasmas indication in suit each set of disease presentation has been specified. The algorithm is validated and optimized at single centre, while multicentre implementations and post-hoc modifications are warranted.}

abstract = {Introduction
Medical reports contain critical information and require concise language, yet often display errors despite advances in digital tools. This study compared the effectiveness of ChatGPT 4.0 in reporting orthographic, grammatical, and content errors in German neurology reports to a human expert.
Materials and Methods
Ten neurology reports were embedded with ten linguistic errors each, including typographical and grammatical mistakes, and one significant content error. The reports were reviewed by ChatGPT 4.0 using three prompts: (1) check the text for spelling and grammatical errors and report them in a list format without altering the original text, (2) identify spelling and grammatical errors and generate a revised version of the text, ensuring content integrity, (3) evaluate the text for factual inaccuracies, including incorrect information and treatment errors, and report them without modifying the original text. Human control was provided by an experienced medical secretary. Outcome parameters were processing time, percentage of identified errors, and overall error detection rate.
Results
Artificial intelligence (AI) accuracy in error detection was 35% (median) for Prompt 1 and 75% for Prompt 2. The mean word count of erroneous medical reports was 980 (SD = 180). AI-driven report generation was significantly faster than human review (AI Prompt 1: 102.4 s; AI Prompt 2: 209.4 s; Human: 374.0 s; p < 0.0001). Prompt 1, a tabular error report, was faster but less accurate than Prompt 2, a revised version of the report (p = 0.0013). Content analysis by Prompt 3 identified 70% of errors in 34.6 seconds.
Conclusions
AI-driven text processing for medical reports is feasible and effective. ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated strong performance in detecting and reporting errors. The effectiveness of AI depends on prompt design, significantly impacting quality and duration. Integration into medical workflows could enhance accuracy and efficiency. AI holds promise in improving medical report writing. However, proper prompt design seems to be crucial. Appropriately integrated AI can significantly enhance supervision and quality control in health care documentation.
Zusammenfassung
Einleitung
Arztbriefe enthalten wichtige Informationen und erfordern eine präzise Sprache. Sie weisen jedoch trotz Fortschritten in der modernen Textbearbeitung häufig Fehler auf. Unsere Studie vergleicht die Effektivität von ChatGPT 4.0 bezüglich der Identifikation und Korrektur orthografischer, grammatikalischer und inhaltlicher Fehler in deutschen neurologischen Arztbriefen mit dem Korrekturlesen durch eine medizinisch versierte Fachkraft.
Material und Methoden
Zehn neurologische Musterarztbriefe wurden jeweils mit zehn sprachlichen Fehlern, darunter orthografische und grammatikalische Fehler, sowie einem schwerwiegenden inhaltlichen Fehler versehen. Die Überprüfung durch ChatGPT 4.0 erfolgte anhand dreier unterschiedlicher Eingabeaufforderungen (Prompts): (1) Identifikation von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit tabellarischer Auflistung der Fehler, ohne den Originaltext zu verändern, (2) Erkennung von Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehlern mit anschließender Erstellung einer überarbeiteten Textversion unter Wahrung der inhaltlichen Integrität, (3) Überprüfung des Textes auf inhaltliche Ungenauigkeiten, einschließlich fehlerhafter Informationen und Behandlungsfehler, mit Fehlerbericht ohne entsprechende Textmodifikation. Als Kontrolle diente eine erfahrene medizinische Schreibkraft. Die Evaluationsparameter umfassten die Bearbeitungszeit, den prozentualen Anteil erkannter Fehler sowie die Gesamtfehlererkennungsrate.
Ergebnisse
Die Fehlererkennungsgenauigkeit der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) betrug für Prompt 1 im Median 35% und für Prompt 2 im Median 75%. Die durchschnittliche Länge der fehlerhaften Arztbriefe lag bei 980 Wörtern (SD = 180). Die KI-basierte Fehleranalyse erfolgte signifikant schneller als die menschliche Korrektur (KI Prompt 1: 102,4 s; KI Prompt 2: 209,4 s; Mensch: 374,0 s; p < 0,0001). Während Prompt 1 als tabellarischer Fehlerbericht schneller, jedoch weniger präzise war, erwies sich Prompt 2 mit einer überarbeiteten Textversion als genauer (p = 0,0013). Die inhaltliche Analyse durch Prompt 3 identifizierte 70% der Fehlinformationen in 34,6 s.
Schlussfolgerungen
Die KI-gestützte Textüberprüfung für Arztbriefe ist schon jetzt praktikabel und effektiv. ChatGPT 4.0 zeigte gute Leistungen mit einer schnellen Fehlererkennung und Fehlerberichterstattung. Die Effektivität der KI hängt maßgeblich vom Prompt-Design ab, das Qualität und Bearbeitungsdauer signifikant beeinflusst. Eine Integration solcher Tools in die Arztbriefschreibung hat das Potenzial, die Genauigkeit und Effizienz des Prozesses zu steigern. KI-Unterstützung stellt daher eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit zur Verbesserung von Arztbriefen dar. Eine smarte Promptgestaltung erscheint auch bei dieser Aufgabe für große Sprachmodelle (LLM) entscheidend zu sein. Durch die Einbindung von KI können die Supervision und die Qualitätskontrolle in der medizinischen Dokumentation erheblich verbessert werden.}

abstract = {The increasing rate of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceaer (CRE) infections poses a significant threat to global public health. Patients infected with CRE often experience frequent recurrences after antibiotic treatment, making it difficult to cure. The design of better antimicrobials that can not only kill CRE but also disrupt biofilms and eliminate persister cells will play a crucial role in improving antibacterial efficacy and preventing recurrent infections. In this hypothesis, we employ an innovative “water pipe” theory to elucidate the potential underlying causes of CRE infection recurrence. We propose a potential therapeutic approach utilizing engineered phages to combat CRE infections, demonstrating the mechanism of action of phages carrying lytic enzymes or antimicrobial peptides against biofilms and persister cells. Furthermore, we evaluate its efficacy and feasibility, which may effectively address the recurrence of CRE infections and reduce antibiotic usage.}

abstract = {Background
Underdiagnosis or undertreatment of osteoporosis consequently impacts individual morbidity and mortality, as well as on healthcare systems and communities as a whole. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard method for identifying osteoporosis, however, opportunistic CT screening is capable of precisely estimating bone mineral density (BMD) in abdominopelvic imaging with no additional cost, radiation exposure or inconvenience to patients. This study uses opportunistic CT screening to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis and anatomic distribution patterns in patients presenting with lower extremity fractures at our institution.
Hypothesis
Trauma patients with low bone mineral density (BMD) are more likely to present with peri-articular versus shaft fractures.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of 721 patients presenting as trauma activations to the emergency department (ED) of a Level 1 Trauma Center with lower extremity fractures. Patients were excluded if under the age of 18 or lacking a CT scan upon arrival in the ED. Hounsfield Units (HU) were measured at the L1 vertebral level on CT scans to determine bone mineral density. Values of ≤100 HU were consistent with osteoporosis, whereas 101–150 HU were consistent with osteopenia.
Results
The final cohort included 416 patients, with mean age of 49 ± 21 years. Average bone density was 203.9 ± 73.4 HU. 15.9% of patients were diagnosed as osteopenic and 9.9% as osteoporotic. 64.2% of fractures were peri-articular, 25.7% were shaft, and 10.1% were a combination. Peri-articular fractures were significantly more likely to have lower average BMD than shaft fractures (189 ± 74.7 HU vs. 230.6 ± 66.1 HU, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a significant relationship between low bone mineral density and lower extremity fracture pattern, however, likely influenced by other factors such as sex. Opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis in trauma settings provides ample opportunity for early detection of low BMD and implementation of highly effective lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy intervention. Reduction in the overall incidence of peri-articular fracture with widespread adoption of opportunistic CT screening may lessen the morbidity, mortality, and total cost currently afflicting patients, healthcare systems, and communities.
