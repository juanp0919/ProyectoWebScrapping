Unlike conventional approaches, GAI-PDPPO incorporates an invertible transformer-based actor-critic architecture capable of modeling high-dimensional channel state information and unknown-source interference. Through the integration of generative pretraining and prioritized experience replay, the framework accelerates convergence and enhances policy generalization.

Faculty redesigned a drug information (DI) assignment to incorporate generative artificial intelligence (AI), encouraging the responsible use of AI to craft DI responses. The purpose of this study was to explore pharmacy students' perceptions of using AI tools in DI assignments and the value of AI-enabled assignments in health professions education.
Educational activity
A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted of third-year pharmacy students' narrative reflections after completing an AI-enabled team DI assignment in a Spring 2024 critical care elective. The steps to complete the DI assignment were: 1) create an AI-generated response to a DI question, 2) critique the AI output, 3) complete an individual literature search, 4) synthesize a final team DI submission, 5) reflect. Student AI use at baseline and anticipated use following the assignment were collected via a pre−/post- course survey.
Evaluation findings
Twenty-one students were enrolled in the course and submitted narrative reflections on the DI assignment. Most students stated that prior to the assignment they had never employed the use of AI for professional or academic reasons (n = 14/20; 70 %). Two themes, describing benefits and challenges, and six sub-themes were identified from the reflective statements: user benefits, awareness of AI and its capabilities, quality of the AI response, skepticism, user responsibility, and limitations of AI.
Analysis of educational activity
Through narrative reflection, students identified benefits and challenges of integrating AI into a DI assignment. While AI enhanced efficiency, students emphasized the importance of ensuring the validity and detail of the AI-generated DI question response.}

Due to its antiviral role, several viruses express proteins that bind IFN-γ, blocking its interaction with the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR). However, varicella zoster virus glycoprotein C binds IFN-γ and induces the expression of a subset of specific ISGs, similar to biased IFN-γ agonists generated based on the crystal structure of the IFN-γ – IFNGR complex. Here, we propose using structural and mechanistic information from viral proteins and biased agonists to design novel IFN-γ agonists that fine-tune IFN-γ – IFNGR activity, reducing the immunosuppressive and toxic effects of this cytokine.}

Unlike conventional forward design approaches, the proposed method enables the direct generation of structural cross-sections from prescribed mechanical performance, represented by target skeleton curves. The DDPM is trained to learn the conditional distribution of feasible joint geometries given a specific input curve, effectively inverting the typically implicit structure-property relationship. To ensure adequate training data, 70,000 samples were generated based on the MNIST dataset, with 60,000 allocated for training and 10,000 for testing. The DDPM learns the conditional distribution of beam-column joints given a specific skeleton curve, thereby effectively mapping performance requirements to sectional design parameters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the DDPM can generate a variety of beam-column sections based on prescribed mechanical performance and can even produce accurate joint sections for skeleton curves not present in the training dataset. The quantitative structural simulation results indicate that 98.3 % of the generated cross-sections have mechanical behavior with a mean error controlled within 10 % of the target curve. This indicates the effectiveness and accuracy of the DDPM in generating beam-column sections that meet desired performance criteria. The proposed inverse design framework highlights the potential of DDPM for intelligent structural design. Future work will explore extending this approach to achieve the inverse design of entire structures.}

However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output. As such, this work provides not just a case study for the integration of LLMs, and GAI more broadly, into chemical engineering curricula, but also valuable insight into student perceptions regarding the use of this nascent technology more generally.}

abstract = {Background
Since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have attracted significant attention in various fields, including surgery. These advancements have been particularly notable for creating highly detailed and contextually accurate images from textual prompts. A notable area of clinical application is the representation of surgeon demographics in various specialties, particularly in the context of microsurgery and plastic surgery-related subspecialties.
Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted in June 2024, utilized the latest version of the Copilot Creative Mode powered by DALL-E 3 to generate images of surgeons across various plastic surgery subspecialties. Real-world demographic data from the US, Japan, and Zambia were compared with AI-generated images for an accurate representation analysis.
Results
Five hundred images (350 from various subspecialties and 150 from geographical sources) were analyzed. The AI model predominantly generated images of male and female surgeons with a statistical underrepresentation of female and Black microsurgeons. Geographical prompts influenced the representation, with an overrepresentation of female (64.0 %; p < 0.001) and Black (16.0 %; p < 0.001) plastic surgeons in the US and exclusively Asian surgeons in Japan. Discrepancies were also observed in the depiction of surgical equipment, with the majority of AI-generated microsurgeons inaccurately portrayed using either surgical loupes (46.0 %) or optical microscopes (32.0 %), not with surgical microscopes (4.0 %).
Conclusions
This study revealed significant disparities between AI-generated images and actual demographics in the fields of microsurgery and plastic surgery-related subspecialties, highlighting the need for more diverse and accurate training datasets for AI models.}

abstract = {Objective
Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using preprocedural Doppler echocardiogram.
Methods
A total of 110 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict postprocedural pressure gradient waveform from preprocedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.
Results
The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and the ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, whereas the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared with the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.
Conclusions
A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement time-varying pressure gradient from the preprocedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications. Further studies are necessary to investigate the gradient change of other valve types.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (gAI) models, such as DALL-E 2, are promising tools that can generate novel images or artwork based on text input. However, caution is warranted, as these tools generate information based on historical data and are thus at risk of propagating past learned inequities. Women in medicine have routinely been underrepresented in academic and clinical medicine and the stereotype of a male physician persists.
Objective
The primary objective is to evaluate implicit bias among gAI across medical specialties.
Methods
To evaluate for potential implicit bias, 100 photographs for each medical specialty were generated using the gAI platform DALL-E2. For each specialty, DALL-E2 was queried with “An American [specialty name].” Our primary endpoint was to compare the gender distribution of gAI photos to the current distribution in the United States. Our secondary endpoint included evaluating the racial distribution. gAI photos were classified according to perceived gender and race based on a unanimous consensus among a diverse group of medical residents. The proportion of gAI women subjects was compared for each medical specialty to the most recent Association of American Medical Colleges report for physician workforce and active residents using χ2 analysis.
Results
A total of 1900 photos across 19 medical specialties were generated. Compared to physician workforce data, AI significantly overrepresented women in 7/19 specialties and underrepresented women in 6/19 specialties. Women were significantly underrepresented compared to the physician workforce by 18%, 18%, and 27% in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics, respectively. Compared to current residents, AI significantly underrepresented women in 12/19 specialties, ranging from 10% to 36%. Additionally, women represented <50% of the demographic for 17/19 specialties by gAI.
Conclusions
gAI created a sample population of physicians that underrepresented women when compared to both the resident and active physician workforce. Steps must be taken to train datasets in order to represent the diversity of the incoming physician workforce.}

Findings reveal that potential customers could not clearly differentiate between the two types of MR and could not clearly identify the ‘better’ of the two.

abstract = {Background
Digital health has been taught at medical faculties for a few years. However, in general, the teaching of digital competencies in medical education and training is still underrepresented.
Objective
This study aims to analyze the objective acquisition of digital competencies through the implementation of a transdisciplinary digital health curriculum as a compulsory elective subject at a German university. The main subject areas of digital leadership and management, digital learning and didactics, digital communication, robotics, and generative artificial intelligence were developed and taught in a transdisciplinary manner over a period of 1 semester.
Methods
The participants evaluated the relevant content of the curriculum regarding the competencies already taught in advance during the study, using a Likert scale. The participants’ increase in digital competencies were examined with a pre-post test consisting of 12 questions. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, an analysis of the acceptance of the transdisciplinary approach as well as the application of an alternative examination method (term paper instead of a test with closed and open questions) was carried out.
Results
In the first year after the introduction of the compulsory elective subject, students of human medicine (n=15), dentistry (n=3), and medical biotechnology (n=2) participated in the curriculum. In total, 13 participants were women (7 men), and 61.1% (n=11) of the participants in human medicine and dentistry were in the preclinical study stage (clinical: n=7, 38.9%). All the aforementioned learning objectives were largely absent in all study sections (preclinical: mean 4.2; clinical: mean 4.4; P=.02). The pre-post test comparison revealed a significant increase of 106% in knowledge (P<.001) among the participants.
Conclusions
The transdisciplinary teaching of a digital health curriculum, including digital teaching methods, considers perspectives and skills from different disciplines. Our new curriculum facilitates an objective increase in knowledge regarding the complex challenges of the digital transformation of our health care system. Of the 16 student term papers arising from the course, robotics and artificial intelligence attracted the most interest, accounting for 9 of the submissions.}

This research investigates how distinct types of GenAI nudges (narrow vs. broad) shape goal desirability and, in turn, consumer empowerment. Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability. Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability, leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes, including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net promoter score). These findings advance theoretical perspectives on GenAI as a nudge for consumer decision-making and offer practical insights for designing AI systems that effectively guide consumer decisions within structured choice architectures.}

AI integration in education is gaining interest, including in nursing, as students seek formal training on its healthcare applications and limitations.
Aim
To evaluate the predictive effect of nursing students' attitudes and acceptance of artificial intelligence on their clinical competencies.
Methods
This descriptive-correlational study was conducted at 2 universities (February–June 2024) with 441 nursing students. Full-time students in clinical practice participated; those absent or on leave were excluded. The Nursing Students Competency Scale, General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale, and Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale were used. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used.
Results
The main factors affecting nursing students' clinical competence were “facilitating conditions,” “social influence,” and “negative attitudes” toward AI. A weak correlation was found between positive AI attitudes and acceptance, which explained 8.6% of the competency levels.
Conclusion
Positive perceptions of AI may increase competence, while skepticism may deepen engagement and critical learning. Strategies to improve the acceptance and use of AI are crucial to maximize its benefits in nursing education and practice.}

Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease requiring ongoing patient education and individualized management. The increasing reliance on digital tools, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI), to answer health-related questions has raised concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensibility of AI-generated information for people living with asthma.
Objective
To evaluate systematically the reliability, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and understandability of responses generated by three widely used artificial intelligence–based chatbots (ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot) to common questions formulated by people with asthma.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 15 questions regarding asthma management were formulated by patients and categorized by difficulty. Responses from ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot were evaluated by international experts for accuracy and comprehensiveness, and by patient representatives for understandability. Reliability was assessed through consistency testing across devices. We conducted a blinded evaluation.
Results
A total of 21 experts and 16 patient representatives participated in the evaluation. ChatGPT demonstrated the highest reliability (15 of 15 responses), accuracy (median score, 9.0; interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-9.0), and comprehensiveness (median score, 8.0; IQR, 8.0-9.0) compared with Bard and Copilot (P < .0001). Bard achieved superior scores in understandability (median score, 9.0; IQR, 8.0-10.0; P < .0001). Performance differences were consistent across question difficulty levels.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–driven chatbots can provide generally accurate and understandable responses to asthma-related questions. Variability in reliability and accuracy underscores the need for caution in clinical contexts. Artificial intelligence tools may complement but cannot replace professional medical advice in asthma management.}

At the same time, higher education (HE) institutions have responded to GenAI by devising policies on their use. Recognizing that L2 writers' processes can be shaped by GenAI, as well as their institutions and instructors' policies, there is a need to understand how L2 writers engage with GenAI tools and negotiate agency as they transition into their studies and find themselves within the boundaries of their HE institution's policies. Through the lens of critical digital literacies (CDL), agency and empowerment, this qualitative study adopted in-depth focus group interviews with a preference selection task to explore how twenty-one post-graduate L2 writers position themselves in relation to GenAI tools and how they and GenAI have been positioned by their instructors. Data were collected within the first month of their post-graduate studies. The findings show that the L2 writers have integrated GenAI into various aspects of their academic writing processes. Their responses suggest that the L2 writers believe the tools empower them and augment their writing abilities. Yet, from a CDL perspective, this may be false empowerment, as the writers showed little critical awareness of how the tools work. At the same time, tensions exist between their perceptions of agency and some of their instructors' GenAI policies. The L2 writers prefer GenAI policies that give them the autonomy to use GenAI flexibly. However, they recognize the need to be accountable for their academic writing and transparent in their GenAI use. Bans on GenAI use were perceived as unfair, restricted agency, and not reflective of GenAI affordances. The findings can inform academic writing training and instructors' policies.}

To address this gap, this study developed a moderated mediation model grounded in identity theory and social cognitive theory, positioning AIL as the predictor, creative self-efficacy (CSE) as the mediator, and creative mindset as the moderator. Using a cross-sectional design, the study employed structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. The results show that AIL significantly and positively predicts CPI, with CSE partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, fixed and growth mindsets exerted distinct moderating effects across the model’s pathways. Multi-group analysis further revealed that among students with more than two years of exposure to generative AI, the impact of AIL on CPI was stronger, whereas the influence of CSE on CPI was weaker. From both cognitive and psychological perspectives, this study clarifies the mechanisms through which AIL shapes students’ creative identity and highlights how differences in AI usage experience alter these pathways. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding creative identity construction in the digital era and offer actionable insights for designing curricula and teaching practices that foster creativity in university education.}

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents unprecedented opportunities to redefine conceptions of personhood and cognitive disability, potentially enhancing the inclusion and participation of individuals with cognitive disabilities in society.
Objective
We aim to explore the transformative potential of GenAI in reshaping perceptions of cognitive disability, dismantling societal barriers, and promoting social participation for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Methods
This study is a critical review of current literature in disability studies, artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, and computer science, integrating insights from disability theories and the philosophy of technology. The analysis focused on 2 key aspects: GenAI as a social mirror reflecting societal values and biases, and GenAI as a cognitive partner for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Results
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of GenAI on perceptions of cognitive disability. It introduces the concepts of GenAI as a “social mirror” that reflects and potentially amplifies societal biases and as a “cognitive copilot” providing personalized assistance in daily tasks, social interactions, and environmental navigation. This paper also presents a novel protocol for developing AI systems tailored to the needs of individuals with cognitive disabilities, emphasizing user involvement, ethical considerations, and the need to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by GenAI.
Conclusions
Although GenAI has great potential for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities, realizing this potential requires a change in societal attitudes and development practices. This paper calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and close partnership with the disability community in the development and implementation of GenAI technologies. Realizing the potential of GenAI for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities requires a multifaceted approach. This involves a shift in societal attitudes, inclusive AI development practices that prioritize the needs and perspectives of the disability community, and ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper emphasizes the importance of proceeding with caution, recognizing the ethical complexities and potential risks alongside the transformative possibilities of GenAI technology.}

abstract = {Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced novel paradigms for long-tailed medical text classification. This task is challenging because tailed classes suffer from severe data scarcity while requiring a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific medical information. To this end, we propose a Generative Class feature Fusion with Agent attention (GCFA) model, which leverages LLM-driven data generation and information fusion to enhance feature representations and mitigate data imbalance. Specifically, a generative head-tailed fusion strategy is proposed, which generates tailed samples by strategically fusing semantically diverse features from both head and tailed distributions. This ensures that generated samples retain tail-class identity while enriching their semantic diversity. Then, we design a prompt-based medical terminology learning method, where LLMs can mine critical, especially some low-frequency medical terms, from three public datasets to construct a medical vocabulary dictionary. This dictionary guides our Medical Agent Attention Mechanism, enabling targeted emphasis on important medical terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated datasets. Our code is available: https://github.com/WQYwqy123456/GCFA-123#.}

Initially, by employing educational resource libraries and learning behavior data, data quality is augmented, and analytical efficiency is refined by preprocessing techniques including data cleansing, resource categorization and labeling, multimodal alignment, and consistency verification. Subsequently, the Transformer architecture is employed to extract learning characteristics from behavioral data, while content relevance is augmented via knowledge point embedding and multimodal content production. A reinforcement learning approach is incorporated to execute a feedback-driven dynamic optimization procedure. Ultimately, comparison trials confirm the substantial benefits of the AIGC-based individualized learning material generation method in enhancing generation efficiency, optimizing resource flexibility, and improving learning outcomes. AIGC enhances educational quality by producing tailored learning materials, so effectively advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 4) for excellent education.

abstract = {Owing to the ability to fuse non-Euclidean node-edge information, Graph Learning (GL) is pervasively leveraged across applications including web recommendation, community detection, and molecular classification. Current GL paradigms extremely emphasize absolute fairness and impartiality for all clients. This limits its flexibility and adaptability in addressing specific circumstances that demand customizable model queries (e.g., access control and intellectual property protection), where authorizable GL models present non-trivial obstacles in realization. Inspired by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), to overcome this limitation, we propose Auth-Graph, the first authorizable GL methodology via a built-in-model access control mechanism. Specifically, our Auth-Graph employs a generative perturbating-driven backdoor to reach authorizable access. The activation of the backdoor is exclusively confined to rightly masked and perturbed inputs, which yield accurate results, whereas all other inputs induce the GL model to produce erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to strengthen compatibility and support multi-user functionality, the masking mechanism operates correctly with a generative masker solely for authorized users possessing valid tokens, with each user’s token being uniquely distinct. Empirical results across benchmark GL models and datasets substantiate that Auth-Graph robustly prevents unauthorized access (average accuracy 3.68%) while promoting legitimate users to attain standard outputs (average accuracy drop 3.45%).}

keywords = {attitude, generative artificial intelligence, GenAI, longitudinal study, perception, qualitative study, senior hospital leader, technology adoption},
abstract = {Background
The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming health care globally. In China, hospitals are rapidly embracing digital transformation. Senior leaders are pivotal in influencing and deciding the adoption of GenAI technologies in professional settings. However, evidence on their perceptions and attitudes and how they evolve over time is lacking.
Objective
This study aims to investigate senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions relating to GenAI and their attitudes toward adopting GenAI technologies in professional settings and to document how their perspectives evolve.
Methods
A longitudinal, descriptive qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. Senior leaders, including hospital directors/deputies and department heads/deputies, from 3 tertiary hospitals across the Hebei, Guangdong, and Sichuan provinces were purposively sampled. Data were collected through semistructured telephone interviews at two time points (baseline and 6 months later). Interview transcriptions were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method to extract themes related to knowledge acquisition, attitudinal shifts, and evolving barriers and facilitators to GenAI adoption.
Results
A total of 32 participants were interviewed in August 2024 and February 2025, including 11 (34.4%) participants from Hebei, 12 (37.5%) from Sichuan, and 9 (28.1%) from Guangdong. Their roles included 8 (25%) hospital directors/deputies and 24 (75%) department heads/deputies. The analysis of the interview transcriptions revealed three primary themes. First, participants’ understanding of GenAI improved markedly over time as they engaged with diverse information sources and gained practical experience. Second, despite widespread support for personal use, senior leaders shifted from initial reluctance to formal institutional adoption. Third, initial obstacles, such as limited technical literacy and resource constraint concerns, diminished over time, while new drivers, including peer influence and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, emerged to catalyze adoption.
Conclusions
Senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions and attitudes toward GenAI have evolved significantly over time. Improved knowledge through diverse information channels has enhanced their comprehension and shifted their stance from cautious personal experimentation toward formal institutional adoption. The dynamic interplay between diminishing obstacles and emerging catalysts, notably the influence of peer practices and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, underscores the potential for transformative change in health care management. Targeted educational initiatives, pilot projects, and robust policy frameworks are needed to facilitate GenAI integration.}

Current empirical studies have mixed results on how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis explores whether and how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. We used the PRISMA method to select, analyze, and report the results. We screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. We compared the effect on student engagement between ChatGPT-based and non-ChatGPT learning. We found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in ChatGPT-based learning in the random effects model. Our analyses further suggest that ChatGPT-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-ChatGPT learning. Our findings revealed ChatGPT is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. We also suggested three roles ChatGPT plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. Our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance.}

This study develops a typology of GenAI-supported work grounded in individual ambidexterity (IA), which highlights employees’ capacity to balance exploration and exploitation while navigating competing demands. Through a thorough review of the literature and empirical examples, we identify four GenAI-enabled work types: Design and Innovation, Data Analysis and Insight Evocation, Customer Service and Engagement, and Content Generation and Optimization. These types reflect the interplay of two critical IA tensions – specialization (generalist vs. specialist) and task routinization (routine vs. non-routine), offering insights into how employees can adapt their skills and roles. Our findings provide actionable recommendations for workforce development, including designing targeted skill-building programs, implementing ethical guidelines, and fostering empowering organizational environments. Additionally, we address the psychological and procedural challenges of integrating GenAI into workplaces and propose strategies to align workforce transformation with policy objectives. By bridging theoretical insights with practical recommendations, this study offers managers a structured roadmap for fostering an ambidextrous and resilient workforce in the age of GenAI.}

The qualitative phase aims to identify the critical factors that influence GAI identity threat. After coding 30 semi-structured interview transcripts, we find that GAI's high intelligence and human-like abilities facilitate three kinds of affordance that influence GAI identity threat: creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance. The quantitative phase, based on IT identity threat theory, constructs a research model to examine how the three types of affordance influence GAI identity threat, as well as identifying the behavioral consequences. An examination of survey data from 405 users indicates that GAI's creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance are associated with GAI identity threat, which may lead to users’ resistance behavior. Furthermore, GAI autonomy and user self-identity moderate the relationship between GAI affordances and GAI identity threat, respectively. This study identifies users’ negative psychological mechanisms when using AI, develops IT identity threat theory in the context of GAI, and provides implications for practitioners to reduce identity threats.}

However, the factors associated with SPI at team level remain underexplored. This study examines the roles of team skill differentiation and team adaptability in fostering SPI, proposing that these factors support teams in the pursuit of sustainability-oriented innovation more effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in shaping the strength of these relationships. Drawing on the double diamond framework and its AI-augmented adaptation, we hypothesize that skill differentiation expands the range of potential solutions in the divergent phase of innovation, while adaptability enhances responsiveness in the convergent phase. GenAI is posited to enhance these effects by augmenting knowledge recombination and real-time strategic adaptation. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a multi-industry survey of NPD teams engaged in sustainability initiatives, applying multiple regression analysis to assess the proposed relationships. All our hypotheses were empirically supported. Overall, this study contributes to SPI research by integrating team capability theory with AI-driven innovation frameworks. The findings highlight the need for firms to cultivate multidisciplinary teams with adaptive capacities while leveraging GenAI as an amplifier rather than a substitute for human expertise. The results also underscore that effective SPI requires both internal knowledge diversity and external responsiveness, alongside AI tools that enhance creativity and sustainability-driven decision-making. Finally, this research provides insights into how NPD teams can enhance their engagement in sustainable innovation, aligning with the broader objectives of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 12.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) leverages large language models (LLMs) that are transforming health care. Specialized ambient GenAI tools, like Nuance Dax, Speke, and Tandem Health, “listen” to consultations and generate clinical notes. Medical-focused models, like Med-PaLM, provide tailored health care insights. GenAI’s capability to summarize complex data and generate responses in various conversational styles or literacy levels makes it particularly valuable since it has the potential to alleviate the burden of clinical documentation on health care professionals (HCPs). While GenAI may prove to be helpful, offering novel benefits, it comes with its own set of challenges. The quality of the source data can introduce biases, leading to skewed recommendations or outright false information (so-called hallucinations). In addition, due to the conversational nature of chatbot responses, users may be susceptible to misinformation, posing risks to both safety and privacy. Therefore, careful implementation and rigorous oversight are essential to ensure accuracy, ethical integrity, and alignment with clinical standards. Despite these advances, currently, no review has investigated HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI in clinical documentation. Yet, such a perspective is crucial to better understand how these technologies can be safely and ethically adopted and implemented in clinical practice.
Objective
We aim to present the protocol for a scoping review exploring HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI and ambient scribes in clinical documentation.
Methods
This scoping review will be carried out following the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Relevant papers will be searched for in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The review will include studies published between January 2023 and September 2025. Studies will be included that represent original peer-reviewed work that explores HCPs’ experiences and opinions about the use of GenAI or ambient scribes for clinical documentation. Data extraction will include publication type, country, sample characteristics, clinical setting, study aim, study design, research question, and key findings. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
Results
The results will be presented as a narrative synthesis structured along the key themes of the evidence mapped. Data will be collated and presented in charts and tabular format. Findings will be reported in a peer-reviewed scoping review.
Conclusions
This will be the first scoping review that considers HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI and ambient scribes in clinical documentation. The results will clarify how HCPs use—or avoid using—GenAI in daily health care work. This insight will help address perceived benefits, risks, expectations, and uncertainties. It may also reveal key research gaps in the field.

abstract = {The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into modern power systems introduces significant challenges in forecasting accuracy, grid stability, and energy optimization. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), including architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers, offers new capabilities to overcome data sparsity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in renewable-dominant systems. This study aims to comprehensively review the emerging role of Gen-AI in improving solar and wind forecasting, load prediction, energy storage management, and smart grid optimization. Using a comparative and synthesis-based methodology, this review analyses findings from high-impact publications between 2023 and 2025. Results indicate that GAN-based models reduce root mean square error (RMSE) by 15–20 % in solar irradiance forecasting and significantly enhance spatial-temporal wind simulations. Time-series GAN-LSTM hybrids enhance demand forecasting accuracy under nonlinear conditions, while VAE-driven dispatch models achieve gains of 9–12 % in energy efficiency and curtailment reduction. The novelty of this review lies in mapping Gen-AI's integration with digital twins, federated learning, and AI–IoT frameworks, which enables the real-time, privacy-preserving optimisation of complex energy systems. The principal conclusion is that Gen-AI serves as a transformative tool to enhance system resilience, forecasting precision, and operational flexibility in renewable energy networks. For sustainable implementation, future developments must address challenges in model explainability, data privacy, and scalability. These findings support the journal’s scope by highlighting AI-driven advancements for the reliable, efficient, and sustainable transformation of energy systems.}

abstract = {Background
Trajectory modeling is a long-standing challenge in the application of computational methods to health care. In the age of big data, traditional statistical and machine learning methods do not achieve satisfactory results as they often fail to capture the complex underlying distributions of multimodal health data and long-term dependencies throughout medical histories. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have provided powerful tools to represent complex distributions and patterns with minimal underlying assumptions, with major impact in fields such as finance and environmental sciences, prompting researchers to apply these methods for disease modeling in health care.
Objective
While AI methods have proven powerful, their application in clinical practice remains limited due to their highly complex nature. The proliferation of AI algorithms also poses a significant challenge for nondevelopers to track and incorporate these advances into clinical research and application. In this paper, we introduce basic concepts in generative AI and discuss current algorithms and how they can be applied to health care for practitioners with little background in computer science.
Methods
We surveyed peer-reviewed papers on generative AI models with specific applications to time-series health data. Our search included single- and multimodal generative AI models that operated over structured and unstructured data, physiological waveforms, medical imaging, and multi-omics data. We introduce current generative AI methods, review their applications, and discuss their limitations and future directions in each data modality.
Results
We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and reviewed 155 articles on generative AI applications to time-series health care data across modalities. Furthermore, we offer a systematic framework for clinicians to easily identify suitable AI methods for their data and task at hand.
Conclusions
We reviewed and critiqued existing applications of generative AI to time-series health data with the aim of bridging the gap between computational methods and clinical application. We also identified the shortcomings of existing approaches and highlighted recent advances in generative AI that represent promising directions for health care modeling.}

abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has marked a significant shift in how organizations operate and innovate. While GenAI offers new opportunities, it has also created new risks that can escalate into crises. Importantly, these crises are not always limited to the organization where they originate but can spill over to other organizations in the same sector, leading to broader reputational consequences. This article investigates such spillover crises in the age of GenAI. We build on Laufer and Wang’s crisis spillover model and extend it to GenAI-related contexts. Specifically, we identify five types of spillover crises associated with GenAI and illustrate them through real-world cases. These cases highlight how reputational damage can extend beyond a single firm, affecting others in the industry. We propose a strategic framework to help organizations identify the risk of spillover crises, and we offer prescriptive guidance for avoiding, mitigating, or responding to spillover crises when they occur.}

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data. Finally, we highlighted the implications for pedagogy and described the research limitations as well as future directions.}

While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning. By systematically synthesizing current findings while avoiding overgeneralized claims, this review contributes to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of GAI in EE and sets the foundation for future empirical exploration.}

The Longevity Games Interview Simulator provides an innovative approach to preparing students for real-world research interactions by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Claude-3.7. This paper outlines the development and demonstrates the benefits of the simulator, designed to mimic interviews with older adults to enhance students’ interviewing skills, empathy, and cultural competence. Key outcomes included preparing students for real-world interactions with interview subjects, improving their ability to identify and properly document protected health information (PHI), gaining experience in asking relevant follow-up questions, and directing conversations to achieve interview goals. The simulator used generative AI models to create realistic interview scenarios based on demographic data from Rochester, NY. Components of the simulator included a student interview-question selection and creation portion, an interview-guide worksheet, a post-simulation quiz on the materials, and a reflective exercise focusing on information gathering and ethical considerations regarding PHI. This tool was designed for the Science of Aging course’s CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) to provide students with practical, repeatable interview practice. A small pilot study with senior nursing students indicated that the simulator improved students’ confidence, preparedness, and understanding of ethical considerations. This paper also discusses how the simulator has potential for adaptation across educational contexts and encourages educators to develop their own custom interview simulations.}

This article examines a lesson study (LS) approach bringing teachers and university faculty together to develop a lesson in data literacy using transformative technologies, including Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) such as ChatGPT.
Design/methodology/approach
An LS team with four teachers from a private school, facilitated by three researchers, conducted two iterations of LS on teaching scatterplots using technologies. Multiple data were collected: Videos of research lessons, videos of lesson planning and post-lesson debriefings, and post-LS focus student group and teacher interviews. Based on an enriched LS framework (Lewis, 2016), this study investigates both students’ and teachers’ learning.
Findings
The students learned new concepts and skills to investigate contextual problems using technologies through the data literacy cycle. Teachers developed an understanding of relevant statistical concepts and pedagogical content knowledge needed for teaching the topic in a technology-rich environment. Teachers realized the potential of using Gen-AI for planning lessons and were eager to explore the effective use of Gen-AI further. Meanwhile, some challenges in using Gen-AI in LS were identified.
Research limitations/implications
This study focuses on both teachers’ and students’ perceived learning based on interview data. However, the integration of classroom teaching data and debriefing data could provide a richer picture of their learning processes.
Practical implications
This study demonstrates how data literacy could be taught through addressing contextual problems using various technologies, revealing both positive effects and associated challenges.
Originality/value
The study contributes to a better understanding of how transformative technology like Gen-AI could be incorporated into LS to strengthen teachers’ and students’ learning.}

To fill this research gap, we examined EFL learners' self-efficacy and writing self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, which were essential motivational constructs underlying GenAI-assisted writing processes. Our person-centered latent profile analysis of 193 EFL learners revealed four groups of students with diverse GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy levels: highly confident all-rounders, practical assistance seekers, interaction-oriented communicators, and unconfident less-adaptable users. These four profiles were found to be closely tied to their writing SRL strategy use. Furthermore, years of English learning experience and perceived English proficiency seemed to be significant antecedents of EFL learners’ GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy profiles. These findings could chart new ways for EFL writing syllabus design in the GenAI context.}

Unlike the passive models learned by generative AI systems, they must capture and control the sensory consequences of action. This allows embodied agents to intervene upon their worlds in ways that constantly put their best models to the test, thus providing a solid bedrock that is – we argue – essential to the development of genuine understanding. We review the resulting implications and consider future directions for generative AI.}

abstract = {Aim
This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence literacy (GAIL) on self-directed learning skills (SDL) among nursing and midwifery students. Additionally, it examines whether general attitudes toward artificial intelligence (GAAI) mediate this relationship.
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support the development of clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing and midwifery education, particularly by enhancing students’ self-directed learning abilities.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study design was used. The study was conducted in three universities in Türkiye between January and February 2025. 656 nursing and midwifery students participated, selected through cluster sampling. Data were collected using the GAIL, GAAI and SDL scales. The survey form included descriptive questions regarding participants' socio-demographic characteristics and AI usage patterns. Structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze direct and indirect relationships among variables.
Results
A significant positive effect of GAILS on GAAIS was found (β = 0.75, p < .01). GAILS also had a direct and significant effect on SDLS (β = 0.60, p < .01). However, GAAIS did not mediate the relationship between GAILS and SDLS (β = 0.02, p > .05).
Conclusions
AI literacy significantly enhances SDL in nursing and midwifery students. However, positive attitudes toward AI do not independently foster SDL, highlighting the need for structured AI education in healthcare curricula. Future studies should explore long-term AI literacy interventions to assess their impact on academic outcomes and their potential contributions to clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.}

abstract = {Purpose
Digital communication has transformed the landscape of psychosocial oncology information for survivors and professionals, potentially influencing the unmet informational needs and supports of cancer survivors and healthcare professionals. This study aims to explore the psychosocial oncology information on social media and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) using a topic modeling approach.
Methods
A qualitative design incorporating structural topic modeling (STM) was utilized to analyze the psychosocial oncology information from social media (WeChat and Rednote) and GenAI (DeepSeek and ChatGPT). Social media data (n = 1177) were collected using the main keywords “cancer” and “psychosocial”, while GenAI data were collected through nine standardized prompts. STM identified topic prevalence, keywords, topic relations, and temporal trends specific to social media posts.
Results
Five topics were identified from social media, highlighting caregivers' reflection, psychological intervention and assessment, family dynamics, and pediatric cancer care. Sharing caregiving reflection as an emerging trend for social support. STM identified seven topics in DeepSeek and five in ChatGPT, commonly focusing on psychological distress, coping strategies and support systems, healthcare professional practices, and holistic care. DeepSeek demonstrated more critical reflection on survivorship challenges and psychosocial care barriers, but identified misinformation. Social media presents in-depth topics, whereas GenAI offers synthesized overviews. Help-seeking resources were limited across both sources.
Conclusions
Findings emphasized the significance of information strategies in psychosocial oncology care. GenAI should be fine-tuning/training with relevant data for improving practices. Social media and content creators are effective tools for promoting evidence-based information. A hybrid model that integrates professional oversight, GenAI, and cloud platforms is essential to ensure ethical compliance with psychosocial care.}

Additionally, biases in data can lead to unequal treatment and exacerbate health disparities. Certain ethical risks include over-reliance on AI in diagnostics, where incorrect diagnoses could have disastrous results. In personalized medicine, AI must avoid supporting health inequalities through biased data. The use of AI in drug development and clinical trials also raises concerns regarding informed consent and patient safety. To address these concerns, best practices must emphasize transparency, accountability, and building trust with patients and providers. Collaborative efforts and emerging ethical frameworks will shape a responsible future for AI in healthcare, ensuring ethical guidelines are integral to AI development.}

Socratic dialogue, which helps patients examine and challenge maladaptive beliefs, is a key component of CBTs. Despite their effectiveness, CBTs often face challenges with low homework completion. Digital mental health tools that use generative artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically large language models, may enhance patients’ homework experience by engaging them in interactive Socratic dialogue. This feasibility study explored clinicians’ perceptions of Socrates 2.0, which employs a multi-agent AI approach combining an AI therapist, AI supervisor, and AI external rater. The tool was developed to engage users in Socratic dialogue to help them identify, evaluate, and potentially reframe maladaptive beliefs outside of therapy sessions, and thus reinforce skills, such as cognitive restructuring. A total of nine clinicians with at least a master’s degree were given two weeks of unlimited access to Socrates 2.0 and participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. Positive themes included surprise at the tool’s sophistication, its potential as a therapy supplement, empowerment of patients, accessibility, and improved perceptions of AI in mental health care. Negative themes included concerns about repetitive questioning, potential replacement of therapists, limitations in crisis situations, and technology literacy barriers. Clinicians also desired empirical evidence of effectiveness and clarity on data privacy. Overall, clinicians recognized the potential of Socrates 2.0 to enhance CBT but emphasized the importance of careful integration and addressing identified concerns.}

This article addresses this debate by asking: Does disclosing the usage of AI compromise trust in the user? We examine the impact of AI disclosure on trust across diverse tasks—from communications via analytics to artistry—and across individual actors such as supervisors, subordinates, professors, analysts, and creatives, as well as across organizational actors such as investment funds. Thirteen experiments consistently demonstrate that actors who disclose their AI usage are trusted less than those who do not. Drawing on micro-institutional theory, we argue that this reduction in trust can be explained by reduced perceptions of legitimacy, as shown across various experimental designs (Studies 6–8). Moreover, we demonstrate that this negative effect holds across different disclosure framings, above and beyond algorithm aversion, regardless of whether AI involvement is known, and regardless of whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, though it is comparatively weaker than the effect of third-party exposure (Studies 9–13). A within-paper meta-analysis suggests this trust penalty is attenuated but not eliminated among evaluators with favorable technology attitudes and perceptions of high AI accuracy. This article contributes to research on trust, AI, transparency, and legitimacy by showing that AI disclosure can harm social perceptions, emphasizing that transparency is not straightforwardly beneficial, and highlighting legitimacy’s central role in trust formation.}

In recent years, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has proliferated across various domains, ranging from advertising and social media to the generation of visual artwork for presentation at esteemed art exhibitions and for sale on the art auction market. Despite its growing prevalence, empirical data show that people maintain a clear bias against AI-generated visual art when they are aware of its artificial origins. Here we explore why this bias might exist, and whether its existence dooms the eventual acceptance and even celebration of art generated by artificial means. We do this by bringing together recent empirical evidence from the disciplines of neuroaesthetics, social cognition, art history, and human—machine interaction to develop several new perspectives that are ripe for empirical evaluation. Given the growing momentum and outlook of AI-generated art, particularly image generation, in today’s society, our aim with this paper is to provide novel evidence-based propositions for understanding the relationship between visual art and artificial intelligence with a clear focus on social cognitive neuroscience perspectives.}

A Basic-element model is constructed to standardize multi-source data. The correlation degree between quantitative indices and predefined evaluation grades is quantified using the classical domain, joint domain, and dependent function. A subjective-objective dynamic weighting framework is established by integrating multiple methodologies, including the entropy weight method, CRITIC, game theory, and D-S evidence theory. By dynamically adjusting weights, the proposed approach resolves challenges related to data conflicts, redundancy, and dynamic variations within complex systems, significantly enhancing evaluation objectivity, adaptability, and decision-making accuracy. Finally, the paper explores pathways for integrating generative artificial intelligence with Extetics, providing theoretical and technical support for evaluating complex systems across multi-domains.}

Study 1 found that integrating both empathy types leads to higher satisfaction and more positive attitudes than using either type alone. Study 2 demonstrated that in support-seeking scenarios, both empathy orders elicited comparable satisfaction and attitudes, whereas in solution-seeking scenarios, the cognitive/affective empathy order was rated higher than the affective/cognitive order. Study 3 indicated that perceived competence and perceived warmth mediate these effects.

In this paper a generative AI method, called GenWave, is presented that shares the same principle as large-language modeling. The method learns the phase relationships in filtered wave data sets so that new wave fields can be generated on demand. GenWaveis based on recurrent neural nets, and it is cast into a bootstrapping algorithm to generate focused wave fields of increasing amplitude. The method is used to generate large waves for both a Gaussian linear water wave, and a non-Gaussian second-order water wave. The comparison of the distributions of phases for the generative AI model to those from Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the method to create new dangerous wave fields for time-domain simulation or laboratory experiment.}

Using survey data, we assessed four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-context variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. These findings contribute to Innovation Diffusion Theory by illustrating how accessibility, knowledge, and institutional support interact across diverse contexts, while offering practical guidance for policymakers and educational leaders to develop targeted interventions that promote equitable GenAI integration in language education worldwide.}

However, deducing these equation-based models requires extensive trial-and-error and strong intuitions. While neural networks may enable the parameterization of material models, they require additional costs for supervised learning and may lead to slower inference. In this paper, we introduce a generative artificial intelligence approach that does not require additional supervised learning to recover the yield surface. Instead, a generative latent diffusion model allows us to deduce yield points with maximum likelihood in the stress space, allowing the model to generalize from sparse or incomplete experimental data. A new projection-based stress update algorithm designed specifically for the mesh-based models enables parallelized integration without the numerical instability or high computational cost of traditional return mapping schemes. Numerical benchmarks–ranging from classical plasticity models to data from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of single-crystal copper–demonstrate that the proposed framework improves robustness, scalability, and inference accuracy. This work contributes a new class of data-driven plasticity models that are computationally efficient and well-suited for complex, path-dependent material behaviors.}

abstract = {Powered by generative artificial intelligence, AI live streaming commerce (ALSC) employs virtual influencers (VI) to promote products. Despite its novelty and hype, research on VIs remains limited. We adopt a novel groundedness theory to study customer engagement in ALSC. Through exploratory interviews, we find that customers can feel grounded in ALSC. Such feelings can be primarily affected by VI characteristics and customer characteristics, which can also affect customers’ purchase motivations. The findings contribute to the ALSC literature by examining the emotional motivations of groundedness in customers’ purchase decisions, in contrast to the existing cognitive focus.The findings also extend the groundedness theory by identifying new sources, contextualized antecedents, and dark sides of groundedness. Additionally, the findings contribute to the VI literature by demonstrating that VIs in ALSC can unexpectedly create engaging customer experiences, which contrasts with the existing notion that customers view VIs as inauthentic and less engaging.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots may be useful tools for supporting shared prostate cancer (PrCA) screening decisions, but the information produced by these tools sometimes lack quality or credibility. “Prostate Cancer Info” is a custom GPT chatbot developed to provide plain-language PrCA information only from websites of key authorities on cancer and peer-reviewed literature.
Objective
The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and readability of Prostate Cancer Info’s responses to frequently asked PrCA screening questions.
Methods
A total of 23 frequently asked PrCA questions were individually input into Prostate Cancer Info. Responses were recorded in Microsoft Word and reviewed by 2 raters for their accuracy and completeness. Readability of content was determined by pasting responses into a web-based Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Scores calculator.
Results
Responses to all questions were accurate and culturally appropriate. In total, 17 of the 23 questions (74%) had complete responses. The average readability of responses was 64.5 (SD 8.7; written at an 8th-grade level).
Conclusions
Generative AI chatbots, such as Prostate Cancer Info, are great starting places for learning about PrCA screening and preparing men to engage in shared decision-making but should not be used as independent sources of PrCA information because key information may be omitted. Men are encouraged to use these tools to complement information received from a health care provider.}

However, with the rapid evolution of consumer demands, traditional aesthetic design processes for personalized products face significant challenges. The core challenge lies in effectively integrating Generative AI, individual differences, and style-based user preference modeling into the personalized product design workflow. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates style-themed information into the generation and evaluation of personalized product aesthetics and a new dataset. In the personalized aesthetic generation phase, a predictive model is developed to infer consumer style preferences. The top-ranked styles are then used as conditional inputs to guide the generation of conceptual design solutions. In the personalized aesthetic evaluation phase, a personalized aesthetic evaluation incorporating style themes is conducted using a hybrid model that combines interaction matrix with collaborative filtering. The proposed method is empirically validated through a case study involving wristwatch design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both aesthetic design generation and aesthetic personalized evaluation. It proves especially effective in enhancing design efficiency and meeting personalized product aesthetic preferences.}

abstract = {Amidst the accelerating progress of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the rise of GenAI-assisted informal digital English learning (GAI-IDLE) platforms has prompted growing scholarly interest in understanding the psychological mechanisms that drive sustained learner engagement. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE fosters user stickiness among Chinese university students by focusing on the psychological needs that influence intrinsic motivation. The constructs of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, control, and flow experience are interpreted within this motivational framework to reveal how learners’ internal psychological states influence their long-term engagement with GenAI-integrated learning environments. Guided by SDT, a survey was conducted with 669 participants, and the data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via Smart PLS 4.0. Empirical findings demonstrate that GAI-IDLE significantly promotes user stickiness through both direct and indirect pathways. Notably, control (β = 0.440, p < 0.001) and flow experience (β = 0.180, p < 0.001) emerged as strong mediators, underscoring the centrality of learner autonomy and immersive experiences in sustaining engagement. While perceived ease of use showed a moderate positive association, perceived usefulness did not exert a significant effect, suggesting that affective and experiential dimensions may be more critical than utilitarian perceptions in motivating continued use. The study highlights the need for GAI-IDLE platforms to foster intrinsic motivation and sustain meaningful engagement.}

In thinking through the case studies, the article presents an argument for how educators can still use Generative AI in their multimodal composition assignments, through teaching students to us it as a process supplement and to always be critically aware of their citational responsibilities. This understanding of Generative AI use is placed in conversation with our understanding of intellectual property law as relates to both the classroom and broader digital composing environments, to better prepare students to create texts in their future careers.}

It employs a strong Business Intelligence paradigm and uses bibliometric analysis and topic modeling focusing on the R program's structural topic model (STM) Package, VOSviewer, and bibliometric software. The results highlight the esteem of GenAI in education and evidence of international collaboration in the research process dedicated to enhancing the rapidly evolving field of GenAI. The scientometric indexes indicate that the diversity of journals has the significant impact on GenAI in education. While Lotka's Law suggests that the field is still in its early stages, the collaborative network demonstrates strong connections among researchers, a positive indicator of future progress. Moreover, the STM method has identified nine pivotal topics grouped into three categories relating to GenAI in education. By shedding light on these emerging themes, this study provides educators and researchers with valuable insights into the future of GenAI in education.}

abstract = {The enormous amount of data and the substantial computational resources are crucial inputs of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, enabling the development and training of AI models. Incumbent firms in adjacent technology markets hold significant advantages in AI development, due to their established large user bases and substantial financial resources. These advantages facilitate the accumulation of enormous amounts of data, and the establishment of computational infrastructure necessary for sufficient data processing and high-performance computing. By controlling data and computational resources, incumbents raise entry barriers, leverage advantages to favour their own AI services, and drive significant vertical integration across the AI supply chain, thereby entrenching their market dominance and shielding themselves from competition. This article examines regulatory responses to these antitrust risks in the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and China, given their leadership in digital regulation and AI development. It demonstrates that the EU’s Digital Markets Act, and China’s Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services introduce broadly framed yet applicable rules to address challenges related to data and computational resources in AI markets. Conversely, the US lacks both AI regulations and digital-specific competition laws, instead adopting innovation-centric policies aimed at ensuring its AI dominance globally. Given the strategic importance of AI development, all three jurisdictions have adopted a cautious approach in investigating potential abusive practices.}

Second, in non-serious destinations, perceived compatibility mediates the positive effect of adoption, while in serious destinations, adoption weakens word of mouth through moral disgust. Third, in non-serious destinations, resurrection image with high appearance realism enhances perceived compatibility, thus improving word of mouth; in serious destinations, low appearance realism evokes greater moral disgust, reducing word of mouth.

abstract = {Purpose
To generate dye-free ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) images from noninvasive ultra-widefield color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and to evaluate its effectiveness in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening.
Design
A cross-sectional study involving generative AI.
Participants
This study included 1263 patients with DR (2747 UWF-CFP images and 18 321 UWF-FA images) from the Second People's Hospital of Foshan.
Methods
Ultra-widefield CFP and UWF-FA image pairs were matched and used to train a pix2pixHD generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model modified with Gradient Variance Loss. The generated UWF-FA images were evaluated using quantitative similarity metrics and qualitative ophthalmologist evaluation. An external data set, DeepDRiD, was used to validate the contribution of the generated UWF-FA images to DR grading.
Main Outcome Measures
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for DR grading.
Results
The generated early-, mid-, and late-phase UWF-FA images demonstrated high authenticity, with multiscale similarity scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and qualitative evaluation scores from 1.64 to 1.98 (1 = real UWF-FA quality). In a Turing test with 50 randomly selected images, 56% to 76% of the generated images were indistinguishable from real images. Generated UWF-FA images successfully depict details of DR lesions, such as a nonperfusion area and leakage. The incorporation of these generated UWF-FA images in DR grading significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.869 to 0.904 compared with the baseline model using UWF-CFP images alone (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The study suggests that the GAN-based model can successfully generate realistic multiframe UWF-FA images, which could enhance DR grading without the need for IV dye injection, with the potential to improve the safety and accessibility of DR screening.

The AI platforms provide generative AI-related services to support users' professional development and gather feedback to enhance the service through experiential learning. However, comprehending large volumes of unstructured datasets in the form of customer reviews presents an increasingly serious challenge as the number of users on AI platforms grows over time. We employ advanced machine learning techniques-topic modelling and word2vec- to extract more accurate insights from unstructured data. We collect customer reviews from AI content-creation platforms from 2022 to 2024. By combining topic modelling and word2vec, we uncover valuable insights. Our analysis identifies eight key topics: Playground, Support Hub, Content Lab, Productivity, User Experience, Access, Business Assistant, and Remix. The topic of regression analysis reveals that Content Lab, User Experience, Business Assistant, and Remix are more favourable in terms of customer satisfaction scores. The word2vec analysis with negative sampling indicates that Access and Playground demonstrate better cohesion scores compared to other themes. Conversely, themes such as Content Lab, Productivity, and Business Assistant have lower cohesion scores, indicating weak clustering among words within these themes. Our research offers several valuable insights for AI platform managers, which can further enhance services through experiential learning.}
