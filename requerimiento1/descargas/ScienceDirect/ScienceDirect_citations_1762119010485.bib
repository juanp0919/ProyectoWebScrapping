Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.
Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.}

abstract = {This case series explores the efficacy of freestyle perforator flaps, including the newly introduced suprascapular artery perforator flap (SSAP), in reconstructing trunk defects. Over a five-year period, 24 perforator flap procedures were performed on 19 patients, primarily for defect reconstruction after skin tumor and ulcer resections. Flap design was customized using preoperative doppler ultrasound and they were then transferred to defects in a V-Y or propeller fashion. The most frequently utilized flaps were the dorsal intercostal artery perforator (DICAP) flap and the lumbar artery perforator (LAP) flap. Notably, SSAP flaps were successfully employed for shoulder defects resulting from squamous cell carcinoma resections. Complications occurred in 29 % of cases, including seroma evacuation, hematoma, and wound dehiscence, with one patient experiencing severe liver failure post-surgery. The versatility of perforator-based reconstruction was demonstrated through the combination of DICAP and LAP flaps for large trunk defects. Additionally, internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) and lateral thoracic artery perforator (LTAP) flaps were utilized for parasternal and infraclavicular defects, respectively. The introduction of the SSAP flap expands the options for dorsal shoulder area reconstruction, offering faster healing and superior cosmetic results compared to traditional methods like secondary intention healing or skin grafting. Although this study showcases promising outcomes, further research is warranted to validate the effectiveness of SSAP flaps and to explore their applications in a broader patient population.}

The analysis identifies six fundamental strategic research themes, ranging from automation and predictive analysis to the personalisation of the employee experience. The paper illustrates the growing importance of AI and HRM, evidenced by an exponential increase in publications since 2016, with a significant peak after the COVID-19 pandemic. The conclusions highlight the need for a balanced approach that integrates technological innovation with rigorous ethical principles, particularly in critical areas such as algorithmic transparency, fairness in decision-making and personal data management. The research also provides a valuable roadmap for future research and sustainable organisational practices in the digital age, highlighting the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as technostress and the implications of personalisation in hybrid work environments. In addition to capturing the ways in which AI is transforming traditional HRM processes and the aspects covered by the literature so far, this paper also establishes a frame of reference for understanding and addressing the evolution of talent management in a rapidly changing technological context.}

abstract = {Generative AI with stronger responsiveness and emergent abilities has triggered a global boom and is facing challenges such as data compliance risks during the pretraining process and risks of generating fake information, which has raised concerns among global regulatory authorities. The European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and other countries and regions are gradually establishing risk-based, scenario-based, and outcome-based governance models for generative AI. China recently introduced new regulations for the management of generative AI, which adopt a governance model focusing on generative AI service providers. It suggests that China is continuing the principle of primary responsibility in Internet governance, which encompasses legal responsibility, contractual obligations, and ethical responsibility. However, the governance model based on primary responsibility emphasizes the accountability of generative AI model service providers, with relatively limited regulation on other important entities such as users and large-scale dissemination platforms, which may not be conducive to achieving China's regulatory goals for the AI industry. In comparison, the Meta-Regulation model could be an ideal alternative for China. As a classic theory explaining the public-private relationship, the ‘Meta-Regulation’ aligns with the generative AI governance requirements. Based on the Meta-Regulation theory, the governance of generative AI in China should move towards a direction of emphasizing safety, transparency, collaborative governance, and accountability. In line with this, it is necessary to include users and large-scale dissemination platforms within the regulatory scope and establish overarching governance objectives that ensure the responsible distribution of duties among stakeholders, with regulatory authorities assuming ultimate oversight responsibility and technical coordination. At the level of specific improvement measures, it is possible to integrate the three stages of model development, usage, and content dissemination of generative AI. During the model development stage, generative AI providers have specific transparency obligations. In the usage stage, a self-regulatory system centered around platform autonomy should be constructed. In the content dissemination stage, the proactive notification obligations of the dissemination platforms should be clearly defined. Additionally, the enforcement of technical interoperability requirements is necessary, thereby promoting the orderly development of generative AI applications.}

In recent years, a growing number of scholars have begun to apply AI to the TCM sector, achieving notable progress.This paper focuses on four key domains: intelligent TCM health management, the intelligent TCM clinical diagnosis and treatment, intelligent TCM academic inheritance and innovation and intelligent TCM industry chain. It systematically reviews practical applications of AI in each of these areas. Furthermore, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the existing challenges in integrating AI with TCM, including the underdeveloped standardization system, insufficient foundational data, lack of model transparency and interpretability, and the urgent need for improved ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks. These limitations hinder the deep integration of AI into TCM. Only through a comprehensive understanding and effective resolution of these issues can AI be fully embedded into TCM practices, fostering innovation in the field and contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to global health initiatives.}

abstract = {Background
The persistence of diagnostic errors, despite advances in medical knowledge and diagnostics, highlights the importance of understanding atypical disease presentations and their contribution to mortality and morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative pre-trained transformers like GPT-4, holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, but requires further exploration in handling atypical presentations.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT in generating differential diagnoses for atypical presentations of common diseases, with a focus on the model’s reliance on patient history during the diagnostic process.
Methods
We used 25 clinical vignettes from the Journal of Generalist Medicine characterizing atypical manifestations of common diseases. Two general medicine physicians categorized the cases based on atypicality. ChatGPT was then used to generate differential diagnoses based on the clinical information provided. The concordance between AI-generated and final diagnoses was measured, with a focus on the top-ranked disease (top 1) and the top 5 differential diagnoses (top 5).
Results
ChatGPT’s diagnostic accuracy decreased with an increase in atypical presentation. For category 1 (C1) cases, the concordance rates were 17% (n=1) for the top 1 and 67% (n=4) for the top 5. Categories 3 (C3) and 4 (C4) showed a 0% concordance for top 1 and markedly lower rates for the top 5, indicating difficulties in handling highly atypical cases. The χ2 test revealed no significant difference in the top 1 differential diagnosis accuracy between less atypical (C1+C2) and more atypical (C3+C4) groups (χ²1=2.07; n=25; P=.13). However, a significant difference was found in the top 5 analyses, with less atypical cases showing higher accuracy (χ²1=4.01; n=25; P=.048).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 demonstrates potential as an auxiliary tool for diagnosing typical and mildly atypical presentations of common diseases. However, its performance declines with greater atypicality. The study findings underscore the need for AI systems to encompass a broader range of linguistic capabilities, cultural understanding, and diverse clinical scenarios to improve diagnostic utility in real-world settings.}

This study focused on first-year university students (N = 392) receiving feedback on their program-specific validated academic achievement prediction, based on various background/(non-)cognitive variables, along with remediation and competence training recommendations. Using a Theory of Planned Behavior model, we analyzed students' intentional (IFE) and behavioral (BFE) feedback engagement, as well as their feedback self-efficacy (FSE) and received feedback. Results show IFE positively influences BFE, while FSE positively affects IFE. Feedback indicating a higher chance of study success increases FSE. IFE fully mediates the relationship between FSE and BFE, and FSE between students’ received feedback and IFE. We discuss directing educational interventions towards enhancing FSE to promote student feedback engagement.}

Anaesthesia for cases involving quadruplets or higher order pregnancy is poorly described: literature review identified only nine cases detailing the conduct of anaesthesia. We present a case of spontaneous quad-chorionic quad-amniotic pregnancy in a 34-year-old patient with two prior CDs, who underwent elective CD at 30 + 5 weeks’ gestation under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anaesthesia with a reduced-dose intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 2.0 mL and diamorphine 300 μg. Key clinical considerations include aortocaval compression and spinal hypotension, heightened risks of haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, eclampsia, preterm delivery and perinatal morbidity. Despite pregnancy induced hypertension, surgery proceeded uneventfully, with an operating time of 46 minutes and 350 mL blood loss. Four live neonates (weighing 1300–1345 g) were delivered and admitted to the neonatal unit without major morbidity. No additional intraoperative analgesia or epidural anaesthesia top-up was required, and the patient reported high satisfaction with anaesthetic management. Postoperative recovery was complicated by maternal hypertension, managed with oral therapy, with hospital discharge on the 4th postoperative day. At 10 months post-delivery, the quadruplets continue to meet age-adjusted developmental milestones. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which low dose CSE anaesthesia was provided for a quadruplet or higher-order CD. The case description highlights the challenges associated with high-order multiple gestation pregnancy, and considerations for the anaesthetist in such cases.}

Furthermore, genetic markers have been used to identify genomic regions associated with economically important traits, which can help increase the genetic response through genomic selection. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and perform a haplotype-based genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions associated with indicator traits for endoparasite resistance in Santa Ines sheep. Haplotype GWAS was performed using linkage disequilibrium blocks (haploblocks) defined by the Haploview software. Records from 1725 animals for Famacha© (FAM, N = 5560), packed cell volume (PCV, N = 5135), total plasma protein (TPP, N = 4356), and fecal egg count (FEC, N = 4248) were used for analysis. The pedigree file contained information from 4821 animals; of these, 638 animals were genotyped using the Ovine SNP50 Genotyping BeadChip. Heritability estimates were moderate for FAM (0.26), PCV (0.26), TPP (0.16), and log-transformed FEC (0.19). Genomic regions that explained more than 0.3 % of the total additive genetic variance of the traits were defined as significant. These regions overlapped with quantitative traits loci associated with eosinophil number, fecal egg count, hematocrit, and immunoglobulin levels. In the top regions for the traits evaluated we found genes individually involved in inflammatory response, immunity, macrophage function in host-pathogen interactions, and other biological functions. All indicator traits for resistance to gastrointestinal parasites evaluated in this study exhibited sufficient genetic variability to respond to selection and can be used to improve the health and consequently the production of Santa Ines sheep.}

As ChatGPT is trained on published material, allowing it to find and parse relevant literature about prompted targets, it in theory is an ideal way to make literature reviews more efficient. As more academics use the tool, gauging the accuracy of the information gathered by this automation becomes important. Our research aims to assess the accuracy of literature found by ChatGPT when performing a systematic review. We searched PubMed for recent systematic reviews on chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and hypertension) published before November 2022. Two researchers extracted aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria from each review. Using these criteria, we prompted ChatGPT to find 10 relevant articles. Researchers then cross-referenced ChatGPT’s results with Google Scholar, PubMed, and Tulane Library’s database. We categorized ChatGPT’s results as fake, real but not in the review, or matched with the review. If ChatGPT provided 10 real articles, we prompted it for another set. We calculated the rates of each outcome. Nine systematic reviews were selected to assess ChatGPT’s ability to conduct literature reviews. In total, ChatGPT found 90 articles after 9 sets of 10 articles each of 90 articles, 58% of articles were real but 38 (42%) of citations were for articles that did not exist. Additionally, of the 90 articles, only 16 (18%) matched articles in the systematic reviews. 38 (42%) were fake, 16 (18%) were real articles that matched the target review, and 36 (40%) were real articles but did not match the reviews. Furthermore, we never achieved 10/10 real articles in a single query. ChatGPT is a tool that can demonstrably make healthcare research tasks more efficient. However, healthcare decision and policy makers cannot yet rely on pure generative AI output without knowing whether humans were involved in the entire research process. And so, there appears to exist an ability ceiling above which the current ChatGPT algorithms cannot reach.}

Methods
Second-year student pharmacists (n = 83) completed a practice SOAP note. Five methods were used to grade the SOAP notes: faculty, peer, near-peer, ChatGPT Plus, and GRADES. Variability in rubric scores among grading methods was analyzed using Friedman 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc testing. Time was tracked for each grading method to evaluate efficiency.
Results
The median scores and IQRs for each grading method were as follows: faculty (65% [56%–71%], peer (78% [62%–88%]), near-peer (77% [72%–86%]), ChatGPT Plus (87% [80%–91%]), and GRADES (66% [57%–73%]). Peer-, near-peer, and ChatGPT scores were statistically different from faculty scores. Scores from GRADES were not significantly different from faculty grading.
Conclusion
The use of an inhouse implementation of GPT-4 (GRADES), with faculty oversight, resulted in rubric scores similar to those of a faculty grader.}

abstract = {Purpose
Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value
This paper provides the latest statistical data on the use of AI technologies in US university libraries. It aims to help librarians understand the overall application situation and best practices. With these insights, librarians can develop corresponding plans to better use AI to serve patrons.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Topic
We sought to determine the literature-pooled association of oral statin use with occurrence of non-infectious uveitis (NIU).
Clinical Relevance
Oral statins have been suggested to confer protective anti-inflammatory effects, though no literature-pooled study has synthesized available literature regarding the association of statins with NIU occurrence.
Methods/Literature Reviewed
Systematic review and meta-analysis registered prospectively on PROSPERO (CRD42025639752). Cochrane library, Embase, and Medline were searched to July 2024. We included any study which reported on the comparative occurrence of NIU events among users versus non-users of any oral statin medication. Review articles, editorials, case reports, and animal studies were excluded. Paired independent reviewers conducted study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) in nonrandomized studies (exposure) tool. A pairwise meta-analysis using random effects and the Mantel-Haenszel method synthesized the literature-pooled occurrence of NIU with versus without oral statin use. Subgroup analyses included a leave-one-out analysis and the omission of “high” ROB studies. The evidence certainty level was evaluated using the GRADE tool.
Results
Five observational studies (n=864,465 participants) were identified. In the main analysis over five studies, oral statin use was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of NIU (OR: 0.76, 95%CI [0.61, 0.96], p=0.02, I2: 26%) compared to non-users. This result remained consistent in subgroup analysis excluding “high” ROB studies, and with exception of one study, predominantly returned consistent results in the leave-one-out analysis. Publication bias was not significant. Four studies had “low” risk of bias while one study had “high” risk of bias given a highly specific inclusion population. Overall, the evidence certainty was rated as “low-certainty” evidence, due to reliance on observational literature.
Conclusions
Low-certainty evidence, over five studies, supports a possible association between oral statin use and lower occurence of NIU events. Larger randomized studies with individual patient-level data are needed to further characterize dose-response activity and control for potential confounding.}

Workflows, advantages and limitations are identified through a comprehensive practical comparison example. The results show many similarities regarding generative capabilities and highlight several advantages of Text-to-Image AI models, including an easier way of capturing product grammars and a wider and more immediate range of further applications. In contrast, Shape Grammars approach proved more solid in aspects related to exploration workflows and cognitive stimulation.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel workflow for designing PSIs using generative design (GD) techniques to streamline the process. The proposed workflow was implemented using GD-embedded software, Fusion (Autodesk Inc.), and tested by designing PSIs for one Le Fort I osteotomy case and one genioplasty case. The performance of the GD workflow was assessed through the time required for design and the basic properties of the GD PSIs. The hands-on time for the design was 94 min for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 45 min for the genioplasty plate. The maximum von Mises stress was 227.63 MPa for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 237.31 MPa for the genioplasty fixation plate. The GD-based workflow simplified and accelerated the design of PSIs for orthognathic surgery.

abstract = {For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the planning of manual assembly activities represents a significant cost and resource factor, requiring precision and meticulous organization. To ensure a stable competitive and economical production, the steps involved in manual assembly must be optimized. In today’s digital era, Artificial Intelligences (AI) offer innovative approaches and opportunities to streamline processes. In addition to LLM AIs, AI image generators are currently attracting a lot of attention as they generate very realistic and detailed images based on a given description. Images or visualisations of the situation are often used to make work instructions in manual assembly easier to understand. AI image generators can be used to visualise assembly process steps for automatically generated work instructions. In this research, a quantitative measure is proposed that can be used to rate how correctly the actual situation is depicted by highlighting incorrect or false objects and operations and assessing the accuracy of the context. The measure is validated by qualitatively evaluating images created with DALL-E 3 in an user study by both workers and planning experts from industry and comparing them with the quantitative measure. This will enable further research in the field of automated work planning and the comparison of different AI image generation tools for use in assembly planning.}

Academic writing is an essential component of research, characterized by structured expression of ideas, data-driven arguments, and logical reasoning. However, it poses challenges such as handling vast amounts of information and complex ideas. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into academic writing has become increasingly important, offering solutions to these challenges. This review aims to explore specific domains where AI significantly supports academic writing.
Methods
A systematic review of literature from databases like PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, published since 2019, was conducted. Studies were included based on relevance to AI's application in academic writing and research, focusing on writing assistance, grammar improvement, structure optimization, and other related aspects.
Results
The search identified 24 studies through which six core domains were identified where AI helps academic writing and research: 1) facilitating idea generation and research design, 2) improving content and structuring, 3) supporting literature review and synthesis, 4) enhancing data management and analysis, 5) supporting editing, review, and publishing, and 6) assisting in communication, outreach, and ethical compliance. ChatGPT has shown substantial potential in these areas, though challenges like maintaining academic integrity and balancing AI use with human insight remain.
Conclusion and recommendations
AI significantly revolutionises academic writing and research across various domains. Recommendations include broader integration of AI tools in research workflows, emphasizing ethical and transparent use, providing adequate training for researchers, and maintaining a balance between AI utility and human insight. Ongoing research and development are essential to address emerging challenges and ethical considerations in AI's application in academia.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Guidelines recommend endoscopic detorsion in cases of sigmoid volvulus without ischemia or perforation, but the timing in which this should be performed is unclear.
Methods
Admissions for sigmoid volvulus in which endoscopic detorsion was performed between January 2010 and April 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The timing was calculated as the time between when the confirmatory radiologic examination and endoscopic detorsion were performed. The timing was compared with various patient outcomes.
Results
One hundred eighteen episodes of sigmoid volvulus from 73 unique adult patients were included (mean age, 69.0 years; 76.3% men). The median time until endoscopic detorsion was 225.5 minutes (IQR, 144.5-478.3) with 81 procedures (68.6%) performed in <6 hours. The timing of detorsion was not associated with the presence of ischemia (P = .289) or a combination of serious outcomes (P = .777). Those who underwent delayed endoscopic detorsion (>6 hours) were more likely to be younger (62.4 vs 67.4, P = .034) and to have had a rectal tube placed (59.5% vs 21.0%, P < .001). Delayed cases were associated with a longer length of admission (5.0 vs 3.0 days, P = .011); however, other outcomes such as the success of endoscopic detorsion, presence of ischemia, readmission rate, and mortality rate showed no difference between the groups. In a multivariate regression analysis, serious outcomes were associated with on-call status (P = .045) but not the timing of detorsion (P = .404).
Conclusions
There does not appear to be a clear correlation between a longer delay until endoscopic detorsion and worse patient outcomes, with only the length of hospitalization affected. This suggests that endoscopic detorsion does not need to always be performed urgently.}

However, the linguistic properties and strategies these models employ remain largely unexplored. We investigate how three available large language models (LLMs) express stance and engage with readers in their writing, providing insights into their abilities to produce contextually appropriate and discipline-specific academic writing. 30 academic essays produced by each model were compared with those of human writers on identical topics using detailed prompts, before annotating each text for stance and engagement following Hyland's (2005) taxonomy. Results indicate that LLMs generally use a narrower and more repetitive range of stance and engagement features than human writers, with significant variation also across each LLM. Disciplinary use of stance and engagement is largely in line with human writing except for the philosophy discipline. Implications for teaching academic writing are discussed, particularly regarding identifying potential LLM-related plagiarism and inconsistencies in academic stance and engagement.}

To clarify whether humans exert control over AI-generated content (AIGC) and whether such control is sufficient to confer authorship, we propose the theory of creative control from a law and aesthetics perspective. According to this theory, a human can claim authorship when they are guided by artistic imagery thinking and manifest individual creativity throughout the entire creation process from conception to execution. In the HAIC model, the unpredictable nature of the AI black box does not impede the recognition of users’ control, as users possess the capability for artistic imagery thinking to direct the entire creation process. If their contribution meets the originality standard, they qualify as the author of the AIGC. Current prevailing views that evaluate AIGC’s originality on the basis of either the final form of expression or the users’ prompts in the initial stage overlook the dynamic nature of the creative process.}

abstract = {Introduction
The effect of gender on teaching satisfaction in clinical medicine has been mixed. While earlier studies often reported that female physician educators receive lower evaluation scores than their male counterparts, particularly in traditionally male-dominated fields such as surgery, more recent evidence suggests a shift, with female faculty receiving comparable or even higher ratings. We hypothesised that female faculty in Orthopaedic surgery, a predominantly male specialty, would receive lower teaching satisfaction scores due to potential biases arising from the male-dominated nature of the field and societal norms.
Methods
A retrospective review of an electronically administered post-lesson teaching evaluation from students from two undergraduate and one postgraduate medical school in the field of Orthopaedic surgery. Evaluations were based on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 on “overall satisfaction” and “educational relevance”. Free text feedback for the educators were also obtained. The data was collected over a three-year period (Academic Years 2021–2024).
Results
A total of 3358 student evaluations from 653 teaching sessions were identified. Male faculty delivered 602 teaching sessions with 3110 evaluations. Female faculty delivered 51 teaching sessions with 248 evaluations. A total of 44 male surgeons and 4 female surgeons were involved in education. Female faculty received higher mean satisfaction scores (4.87 ± 0.24) compared to males (4.73 ± 0.47) (p = 0.035). Relevance scores were not significantly different (female 4.87 ± 0.27, male 4.79 ± 0.38, p = 0.16). “Clear” and “engaging” were the top two most frequently used adjectives to describe the teaching characteristics for both genders. The third-ranked adjective was “interactive” for males and “helpful”, “encouraging”, and “interactive” for females in a three-way tie.
Conclusions
Female Orthopaedic faculty achieved higher teaching satisfaction scores compared to male counterparts, dispelling possible negative gender stereotypes in both the male-dominated field and within the broader Southeast Asian social context.}

The researchers confirmed that the integration of PP principles contributes to the well-being of students. There was a strong connection between the variables of positive well-being and motivation (Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation). Gender was the only socio-demographic factor that influenced the well-being of students during the PP interventions. Teachers and educational administrators may adapt the presented approaches to their specific objectives and tasks, taking into account the needs and characteristics of their students.}

abstract = {Generative AI (genAI) tools have involved rapid and broad uptake since their wide release in late 2022, including among teachers. We investigated several factors that play a role in teachers’ motivation and engagement to harness genAI in teaching and learning. We examined contextual factors (in-school support to apply genAI, time pressure, disruptive student behavior) as predictors of motivation (genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., genAI integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities) over the course of one school term. Among 368 Australian primary and secondary school teachers, our findings revealed that genAI support was associated with greater genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing. Time pressure was also linked with greater genAI valuing, whereas disruptive student behavior was not linked with the genAI motivation or engagement variables. In turn, genAI self-efficacy was linked with greater levels of both types of genAI integration. GenAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work only. Our results provide knowledge about factors relevant for supporting genAI and its application among teachers in Australia—and also hold relevance to teachers in other countries.}

abstract = {Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) imaging is a non-invasive quantitative detection technique that locates and quantifies fluorescent molecular probes in biological tissue. However, due to the light scattering effect and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, it is difficult to accurately reconstruct the fluorescence distribution. Traditional iterative reconstruction methods rely on the selection of regularization parameters, and data-driven deep learning methods have insufficient interpretability. In order to improve the imaging quality, fluorescence molecular tomography via score-based generative model (FTSG) is proposed. Prior information about the fluorescence target distribution is extracted via score-based generative model, which is used as a regularization term constraint for an iterative process based on the physical model. FTSG is validated through simulations and experiments using fluorescent targets with different radii and edge-to-edge distances. Compared with traditional methods, FTSG offers better resolution and reconstruction quality. This method can effectively distinguish two fluorescent targets with an edge-to-edge distance of 1 mm.}

abstract = {Background
Through third party applications, patients in the United States have access to their electronic health record (EHR) data from multiple health care providers. However, these applications offer only a predefined organization of these records by type, time stamp, or provider, leaving out meaningful connections between them. This prevents patients from efficiently reviewing, exploring, and making sense of their EHR data based on current or ongoing health issues. The lack of personalized organization and important connections can limit patients’ ability to use their data and make informed health decisions.
Objective
To address these challenges, we created Discovery, an experimental app that enables patients to organize their medical records into collections, analogous to placing pictures in photo albums. These collections are based on the evolving understanding of the patients’ past and ongoing health issues. The app also allows patients to add text notes to collections and their constituent records. By observing how patients used features to select records and assemble them into collections, our goal was to learn about their preferred mechanisms to complete these tasks and the challenges they would face in the wild. We also intended to become more informed about the various ways in which patients could and would like to use collections.
Methods
We conducted a think-aloud evaluation study with 14 participants on synthetic data. In session 1, we obtained feedback on the mechanics for creating and assembling collections and adding notes. In session 2, we focused on reviewing collections, finding data patterns within them, and retaining insights, as well as exploring use cases. We conducted reflexive thematic analysis on the transcribed feedback.
Results
Collections were useful for personal use (quick access to information, reflection on medical history, tracking health, journaling, and learning from past experiences) and clinical visits (preparation and raising physicians’ awareness). Assembling EHR data into reliable collections could be difficult for typical patients due to considerable manual work and lack of medical knowledge. However, automated collection building could alleviate this issue. Furthermore, having EHR data organized in collections may have limited use. However, augmenting them with patient-generated data, which are entered with flexible richness and structure, could add context, elevate meaning, and improve actionability. Finally, collections might produce a misconstrued health picture, but bringing the physician in the loop for verification could increase their clinical validity.
Conclusions
Collections can be a powerful tool for advancing patients’ proactivity, awareness, and self-advocacy, potentially facilitating patient-centered care. However, patients need better support for incorporating their own everyday data and adding meaningful annotations for future reference. Improvements in the comprehensiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the collection assembly process through automation are also necessary.}

The paper examines the leading foresight and anticipation techniques and explores their possible data protection applications by reviewing existing initiatives that attempt to implement foresight in the context of data protection. Section 2 delves into the evolving regulatory landscape, emphasising the need for a foresight-based approach to tackle the complexities arising from data-intensive technologies and the changing European regulatory framework. Section 3 introduces foresight as a discipline, its history and evolution, and leading techniques. Section 4 presents practical examples of foresight in data protection, detailing initiatives by the authors and other actors in the data protection space. In conclusion, the paper underscores the initial consensus on the benefits of anticipatory approaches in addressing current data protection challenges. Anticipation techniques, as a flexible concept, can be tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders, fostering a collaborative and practical approach to data protection. However, a gap in consolidated methodologies persists, necessitating further research to design and implement practical foresight approaches.}

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) often responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. This study aimed to enhance the efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX) by co-encapsulating it with a ruthenium (II) complex (Ru-II) and curcumin nanoparticles (C-NP).
Methods
C-NPs were prepared via wet milling, and Ru-II was synthesized through ligand coordination and reduction. The conjugate (CoENC-PTX) was obtained by combining PTX, Ru-II, and C-NP, followed by ultrafiltration. Characterization was performed using UV–Vis, FTIR, XRD, and HRSEM. In vitro evaluations included drug release, cytotoxicity assays on OSCC cells, live/dead cell labeling, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis.
Results
CoENC-PTX showed efficient encapsulation with distinct spectral, crystalline, and morphological features. Drug release exhibited a biphasic profile, with 94.8 % release in 48 h. Cytotoxicity assays indicated dose-dependent reduction in OSCC cell viability, with maximum effect at 100 μg/mL. Live/dead staining confirmed apoptosis, while qPCR revealed p53 and c-Myc overexpression, indicating apoptosis activation and cell cycle regulation.
Conclusion
The PTX–Ru-II–C-NP formulation significantly improved the anticancer activity against OSCC, offering a promising synergistic approach for oral cancer therapy.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
Patients find technology tools to be more approachable for seeking sensitive health-related information, such as reproductive health information. The inventive conversational ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc), offers a potential means for patients to effectively locate answers to their health-related questions digitally.
Objective
A pilot study was conducted to compare the novel ChatGPT with the existing Google Search technology for their ability to offer accurate, effective, and current information regarding proceeding action after missing a dose of oral contraceptive pill.
Methods
A sequence of 11 questions, mimicking a patient inquiring about the action to take after missing a dose of an oral contraceptive pill, were input into ChatGPT as a cascade, given the conversational ability of ChatGPT. The questions were input into 4 different ChatGPT accounts, with the account holders being of various demographics, to evaluate potential differences and biases in the responses given to different account holders. The leading question, “what should I do if I missed a day of my oral contraception birth control?” alone was then input into Google Search, given its nonconversational nature. The results from the ChatGPT questions and the Google Search results for the leading question were evaluated on their readability, accuracy, and effective delivery of information.
Results
The ChatGPT results were determined to be at an overall higher-grade reading level, with a longer reading duration, less accurate, less current, and with a less effective delivery of information. In contrast, the Google Search resulting answer box and snippets were at a lower-grade reading level, shorter reading duration, more current, able to reference the origin of the information (transparent), and provided the information in various formats in addition to text.
Conclusions
ChatGPT has room for improvement in accuracy, transparency, recency, and reliability before it can equitably be implemented into health care information delivery and provide the potential benefits it poses. However, AI may be used as a tool for providers to educate their patients in preferred, creative, and efficient ways, such as using AI to generate accessible short educational videos from health care provider-vetted information. Larger studies representing a diverse group of users are needed.}

abstract = {Spinal endoscopy is a major advance in spinal surgery, offering a minimally invasive alternative to traditional techniques. Since the ﬁrst attempts at indirect visualization of the spinal canal in the 20th century, numerous technological advances have extended the applications of endoscopy, from treating herniated discs to lumbar fusion. Two main techniques are used: uniportal, with a single incision for instruments and endoscope, and biportal, inspired by arthroscopy, using two separate incisions. Uniportal techniques are precise and allow minimal approaches, ideal for simple procedures, while biportal techniques offer better maneuverability for more complex procedures. Spinal endoscopy has proven effective in treating compressive lumbar pathologies: herniated discs, canal or foraminal stenosis, and medullary compression in cervical and thoracic pathologies. It considerably reduces postoperative morbidity and ensures rapid recovery, less pain and fewer infectious complications. However, the learning curve for these techniques is a signiﬁcant challenge, requiring experience and specialized training. Among other limitations, there is an increased risk of hematoma, transient dysesthesia and accidental durotomy. The high cost of specialized equipment is also a barrier to widespread adoption, although savings are achieved via shorter hospital stay. Despite these challenges, spinal endoscopy is becoming increasingly well-established, with future prospects linked to technological improvements and surgeon training.

abstract = {Background and objective
Levator aponeurosis advancement is a technique used to treat aponeurotic ptosis, which can be performed via anterior (transcutaneous) or posterior (transconjunctival) approach, each with specific advantages. This study aims to evaluate and compare pre- and postoperative eyelid aperture outcomes for both techniques and analyze the rate of over- and undercorrections, contributing to a better understanding of their efficacy and limitations.
Materials and methods
We conducted a retrospective study on 62 eyelids with aponeurotic ptosis and good levator function. A total of 32 anterior and 30 posterior approaches were performed, assessing marginal reflex distance 1 (MRD1), eyelid aperture (EA), and their pre- and postoperative variations, along with the rate of over- and undercorrections relative to ideal values.
Results
MRD1: Preoperative values for the anterior approach were 1.59 ± 1.08 mm, and 0.85 ± 1.00 mm for the posterior approach. Improvements were 2.08 ± 1.59 mm for the anterior approach and 2.13 ± 1.32 mm for the posterior one (p > 0.05). EA: Improvements were 2.03 ± 2.15 mm for the anterior approach and 2.50 ± 1.66 mm for the posterior one (p > 0.05). Ideal MRD1 correction (4 mm) was achieved in 31.3% of anterior cases vs 20.0% of posterior cases (p ≈ 0.05). Ideal EA correction (10 mm) was achieved in 18.8% of anterior cases vs 3.3% of posterior cases (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Both approaches are effective, but the anterior approach demonstrates higher rates of ideal corrections and fewer undercorrections. The posterior approach was used in lower preoperative MRD1 cases, which may have influenced the results. Selection should be based on the patient’s specific characteristics and needs.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo
La reinserción de la aponeurosis elevadora es utilizada para tratar ptosis de origen aponeurótico, mediante abordaje anterior (transcutáneo) o posterior (transconjuntival), cada uno con ventajas según el caso. El presente estudio tiene como objetivo evaluar y comparar la apertura palpebral preoperatoria y postoperatoria obtenida con ambas técnicas, y analizar la incidencia de hipercorrecciones e hipocorrecciones, contribuyendo al entendimiento de la efectividad y limitaciones de cada técnica.
Materiales y métodos
Estudio retrospectivo de 62 párpados con ptosis palpebral aponeurótica y buena función elevadora. Se realizaron 32 abordajes anteriores y 30 posteriores, evaluando la distancia reflejo-margen 1 (DMR1), apertura palpebral (AP) y sus variaciones preoperatorias y postoperatorias, además determinando hipercorrecciones o hipocorrecciones con respecto a valores ideales.
Resultados
DMR1: el preoperatorio del abordaje anterior fue 1,59 ± 1,08 mm, versus 0,85 ± 1,00 mm del posterior. El abordaje anterior tuvo mejoría de 2,08 ± 1,59 mm, versus 2,13 ± 1,32 mm del posterior (p > 0,05). AP: el abordaje anterior tuvo mejoría de 2,03 ± 2,15 mm versus 2,50 ± 1,66 mm del posterior (p > 0,05). Corrección ideal de DMR1 (4 mm): lograda en el 31,3% de los abordajes anteriores, versus 20,0% de los posteriores (p ≈ 0,05). Corrección ideal de AP (10 mm): lograda en el 18,8% de los abordajes anteriores, versus 3,3% de los posteriores (p < 0,05).
Conclusiones
Ambos abordajes son efectivos, pero el anterior muestra mayor tasa de correcciones ideales y menos hipocorrecciones. El abordaje posterior se usó en ptosis con DMR1 preoperatorias menores, lo cual pudo haber influenciado en los resultados. La elección debe basarse en las características y necesidades específicas del paciente.}
