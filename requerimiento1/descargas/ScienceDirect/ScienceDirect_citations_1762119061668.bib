abstract = {This article aims to introduce emerging measurement domains made feasible through the electronic health record (EHR) use metadata, to inform the changing landscape of health care delivery. We reviewed emerging domains in which EHR metadata may be used to measure health care delivery, outlining a framework for evaluating measures based on desirability, feasibility, and viability. We argue that EHR use metadata may be leveraged to develop and operationalize novel measures in the domains of team structure and dynamics, workflows, and cognitive environment to provide a clearer understanding of modern health care delivery. Examples of measures feasible using metadata include quantification of teamwork and collaboration, patient continuity measures, workflow conformity measures, and attention switching. By enabling measures that can be used to inform the next generation of health care delivery, EHR metadata may be used to improve the quality of patient care and support clinician well-being. Careful attention is needed to ensure that these measures are desirable, feasible, and viable.}

abstract = {This paper introduces readers to the use of multimodal visualization reflections (MVRs) in applied linguistics research, with special attention paid to its applications for researching various topics within second language (L2) writing. MVRs are a method of data elicitation, in which participants are asked to illustrate something (either in print or digitally) as a means of visualizing a process, an idea, and/or their current knowledge state on a given topic. Participants are then typically asked to describe what their visualization represents, including all parts of their illustration. Although MVRs have been used in a handful of L2 writing studies, their full potential has yet to be realized. Thus, this paper advocates for their use in future studies. The paper opens with a review of the concept of multimodality and its place within contemporary applied linguistics scholarship. Next, discussed is the theoretical support behind leveraging MVRs. Example studies are then outlined, showcasing how MVRs have been leveraged by previous researchers when investigating different phenomena (e.g., L2 learners’ genre awareness, identities, ideologies, and issues involving language testing). The article closes with a discussion of future research directions covering how L2 writing scholars might adopt MVRs in future studies.}

abstract = {Dependency-driven relation extraction (DDRE) intends to improve the classification performance by exploring the syntax information contained in dependency tree. Although recent works have made impressive advances, they usually suffer severe challenges of losing sequential semantics information due to the pruning strategy. In addition, task-irrelevant information in representations such as noise or entity appositive information might be dominant in the procedure of representation learning, which interferes with the final performance of relation classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-view syntax-semantics information bottleneck (MS2IB) model, which aims at exploring supplementary information from a newly incorporated view and captures minimum sufficient information for the DDRE task. Specifically, MS2IB treats the DDRE task as a multi-view information learning procedure, where the sequential semantics information is supplemented under the guidance of representation learning with multiple views. Meanwhile, the minimum sufficient task-relevant information is extracted from the aspect of information compression and information preservation simultaneously. Finally, we formulate the objective of MS2IB as an information loss function based on the measurement of mutual information, where a new variational approach is presented to ensure its local optimum. Experiments on benchmark datasets and self-constructed dataset are conducted to show the superiority of MS2IB over the state-of-the-art models. For example, the proposed MS2IB achieves 91.42 % Precision, 89.21 % Recall and 90.28 % F1-score on the SemEval-2010 dataset. The MS2IB model further demonstrates strong generalization on domain datasets and robust performance on large-scale and noisy dataset. With the promising performance on both universal and domain datasets, the proposed model can be applied into various practical applications, such as information extraction and inference of transportation incidents/accidents.}

abstract = {Aim
This study examined undergraduate nursing students’ experiences and acceptance of NurCaseAI, a GenAI-based interactive case study system powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. The investigation was guided by the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) model.
Background
Clinical reasoning is a critical skill for undergraduate nursing students. The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) offers opportunities to support clinical learning; however, concerns about content accuracy and conversational quality remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance GenAI systems by grounding outputs in validated nursing knowledge, improving reliability for educational use.
Design
A qualitative exploratory design was adopted.
Methods
16 third-year nursing students from a Chinese university were purposively selected after completing three thyroid perioperative nursing case scenarios using NurCaseAI. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results
Five key themes were identified: 1) Perceived system capabilities and limitations as students viewed NurCaseAI as an effective learning aid with analytical constraints; 2) Learning enhancement benefits where RAG content aligned well with coursework and guidelines; 3) Interaction efficiency challenges including initial barriers in system adaptation; 4) Limited emotional engagement as students viewed the system as task-oriented rather than empathetic; 5) Strong system acceptance with willingness to continue using NurCaseAI despite limitations.
Conclusion
NurCaseAI demonstrates promise as a supplementary GenAI tool for nursing education, particularly in perioperative and case-based learning. The AIDUA model offered a valuable lens to understand students’ acceptance patterns. Future improvements should enhance affective interaction and support more complex clinical communication.}

abstract = {Background
As a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, radiology reports are immediately released to patients. We determine if readers of radiology reports, via electronic health records (EHRs), and radiology report complexity have changed post the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was used to analyze 10,000 radiology reports (equal split of CT, mammogram, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound modalities) per year between 2013 and 2023. Readability was calculated through reading grade level indices.
Results
Patient viewership of their radiology reports via EHRs increased from 3.3 % (95 % CI: 3.0 %–3.7 %) in 2013 to 58.2 % (95 % CI: 57.3 %–59.2 %) in 2023. Once the 21st Century Cures Act's Information Blocking Provision went into effect, there was a significant increase in viewing probability with patients having 1.71 times higher odds of viewing their reports (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI: 1.27–2.32, p < 0.001). This increase in patient viewership held for all modalities tested except CT (P < 0.01). Despite increased viewership, the reading grade level of radiologist dictated radiology reports was greater than the recommended level for health information across all years and modalities tested.
Conclusions and relevance
Patients are increasingly engaging with their radiology reports, but reports may be too complex for the typical patient. Solutions will be required to improve patient experience with their radiology reports.}

To evaluate the ability of a large language model (LLM) to identify exudative recurrence in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and compare its performance with retina specialists.
Design
Retrospective, single-center, observational study.
Methods
Two consecutive OCT scans of patients with nAMD under pro re nata (PRN) regimen were collected. Screen recordings of the complete OCT scan comparisons (previous vs. current) were analyzed by two retina specialists versus ChatGPT-4o after providing a standardized prompt. Main outcome measure was agreement between the LLM and the ophthalmologists in detecting exudative activity. Statistical measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen’s kappa for agreement.
Results
A total of 102 eyes were included. Among 71 confirmed recurrences, ChatGPT-4o correctly identified 63 and missed 8; of 31 non-recurrences, it correctly identified 10 and misclassified 21 as positive. Overall accuracy was 71.57 %, with sensitivity of 88.73 % and specificity of 32.26 %. Agreement with ophthalmologists was fair (Cohen’s k = 0.238).
Conclusion
ChatGPT-4o demonstrated strong sensitivity in detecting exudative recurrences in nAMD, but limited specificity. Given the small, single-center cohort, the lack of external or same-dataset validation, these results should be considered preliminary, but highlights as LLM-assisted analysis, while not yet capable of replacing clinical expertise, may serve as a valuable adjunct for screening exudative changes in nAMD. Further refinements in the LLM could improve specificity and clinical utility.}

Robust biosafety and bioethics evaluations are therefore required to address potential risks such as immune reactions, cellular pathway disruptions, and environmental persistence. We systematically analyse the computational frameworks underpinning this revolution and highlight the capability of de novo proteins to act as a modular toolkit for synthetic biology. Looking forward, we envision integrating closed-loop validation with multi-omics profiling for comprehensive risk assessments along with a hierarchical design framework for advancing the future of synthetic biology – from the creation of tailored de novo functional protein modules and structure-guided rational genetic circuits design to the development of full-synthetic cellular systems, thereby establishing a scalable path from protein design to system-level implementation.}

We retrospectively investigated clinical, radiological, and pathological features of B3 lesions associated with the risk of subsequent upgrade to malignancy. Methods: We included consecutive vacuum-assisted biopsies (VABs) performed during 2011–2020 on suspicious microcalcifications not associated with other radiological signs diagnosed as B3 lesions and followed by surgical excision (SE) with definitive histological examination. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to identify independent predictors of malignancy. Results: Out of the 366 B3 lesions included, 56 (15.3 %, 95 % CI 11.8–19.4 %) had upgraded to malignancy at SE: of these, 42/366 (11.5 %, 95 % CI 8.4–15.2 %) and 14/366 (3.8 %, 95 % CI 2.1–6.3 %) were in situ and invasive carcinoma, respectively. At univariate analysis, variables positively associated with upgrade to malignancy were age ≥ 60 years (p = 0.008), mixed morphology (p = 0.018), scattered distribution (p = 0,001), extension of microcalcifications > 10 mm (p = 0.001), and mixed B3 lesion (p = 0.017). Among B3 subtypes, the highest rates of upgrade were observed for AIDEP, LCIS/LIN2, FEA + AIDEP, FEA + LCIS/LIN2, and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (24.6 %, 21.4 %, 25.3 %, 20.0 % and 40.0 % respectively), while FEA and ALH/LIN1 had a lower rates of upgrade (7.5 % and 3.7 %, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed as risk factors older age (p = 0.029), larger extension (p = 0.001) and mixed morphology (p = 0.007) of microcalcifications, AIDEP (p = 0.011) among pure B3 lesions, and FEA + AIDEP (p = 0.001) and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (p = 0.037) among mixed B3 lesions. Conclusions: Based on our findings, vacuum-assisted excision is reasonable as definitive management for FEA and ALH/LIN1, while SE should remain the mainstay of treatment for AIDEP and LCIS/LIN2, whose upgrade rates are too high to safely recommend VAE.}

Augmentation cystoplasty (AC) is a surgical procedure used to manage pediatric neurogenic bladder (NB) when conservative treatments fail. While AC improves bladder function and continence, it carries significant long-term risks. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the functional benefits and complications of AC in pediatric NB patients.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception until February 14, 2025. Eligible studies included pediatric patients (≤18 years) with NB who underwent AC. Primary outcomes were continence improvement and bladder capacity increase, while secondary outcomes included complications such as bladder stones, perforation, and reoperation rates. A one-group meta-analysis was performed using logit transformation for categorical outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics.
Results
Nine retrospective cohort studies comprising 696 pediatric patients were included. The pooled continence improvement rate was 78.1 % (95 % CI: 62–89 %), and bladder capacity increased by 82.1 % (95 % CI: 64.3–99.9 %). The incidence of bladder stones was 19.3 %, bladder perforation was 6.0 %, and reoperation occurred in 24 % of cases. Significant heterogeneity was observed for reoperation rates (I2 = 97 %).
Conclusion
AC effectively improves continence and bladder capacity in pediatric NB patients, but it carries a substantial risk of complications. The high reoperation and complication rates underscore the need for careful patient selection, standardized surgical techniques, and structured follow-up.}

abstract = {As we move beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of future infodemics remains significant, driven by emerging health crises and the increasing influence of artificial intelligence in the information ecosystem. During periods of apparent stability, proactive efforts to advance infodemiology are essential for enhancing preparedness and improving public health outcomes. This requires a thorough examination of the foundations of this evolving discipline, particularly in understanding how to accurately identify an infodemic at the appropriate time and scale, and how to distinguish it from other processes of viral information spread, both within and outside the realm of public health. In this paper, we integrate expertise from data science and public health to examine the key differences between information production during an infodemic and viral information spread. We explore both clear and subtle distinctions, including context and contingency (ie, the association of an infodemic and viral information spread with a health crisis); information dynamics in terms of volume, spread, and predictability; the role of misinformation and information voids; societal impact; and mitigation strategies. By analyzing these differences, we highlight challenges and open questions. These include whether an infodemic is solely associated with pandemics or whether it could arise from other health emergencies; if infodemics are limited to health-related issues or if they could emerge from crises initially unrelated to health (like climate events); and whether infodemics are exclusively global phenomena or if they can occur on national or local scales. Finally, we propose directions for future quantitative research to help the scientific community more robustly differentiate between these phenomena and develop tailored management strategies.}

However, with the explosive growth of demand for data and annotation in generative models and the emphasis on data-centric algorithms, improving model performance by improving data-efficiency has become another way for the future development of generative models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve the performance of the generative models inspired by active learning. Through the cognitive feature extractor of generative models (similar oracle in active learning) to complete the annotation of data informativeness. By guiding the generative models to focus on samples in low-feature density region, i.e., with high informativeness, the models can gradually achieve “full-cognition” of the data. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our strategy and demonstrate its widespread application in generative models and downstream data-driven tasks.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic meningococcal disease is a rare and under-recognized manifestation of Neisseria meningitidis infection. Unlike acute meningococcal infections, its presentation is insidious, leading to diagnostic delays. We conducted a systematic review to better characterize its clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological profile.
Methods
A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024608035). We searched Excerpta Medica, National Library of Medicine, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies for cases reported since 1960 using the terms “chronic meningococcemia” or “chronic meningococcal disease.” Eligible cases involved previously apparently healthy individuals with N. meningitidis isolated from a normally sterile site. Two reviewers independently extracted data on demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes.
Results
A total of 126 cases from 97 reports were included. Most patients (median age: 21 years) presented with recurrent fever (98 %), non-blanching skin lesions (95 %), and musculoskeletal symptoms (90 %) over a period of ≥ 10 days. In over two-thirds of cases, symptoms followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with alternating episodes of fever, rash, and joint involvement. Diagnosis was delayed longer in adults than in children (P < 0.0001). Blood cultures were positive in 77 % of cases; molecular testing and skin biopsy improved diagnostic yield. N. meningitidis serogroup B (58 %) and C (31 %) were most common. Meningeal signs were largely absent (94 %). Antimicrobial therapy led to complete recovery without sequelae in all patients. Testing for inherited susceptibility was conducted in 52 cases and revealed abnormalities - primarily complement deficiencies - in 13 (23 %) of them.
Conclusions
Chronic meningococcal disease should be considered in individuals with relapsing fever, vasculitic skin lesions, and joint involvement, especially when cultures are negative or symptoms mimic viral or autoimmune conditions. Early use of molecular diagnostics and awareness of characteristic patterns may improve recognition. The term "relapsing-remitting meningococcal disease" may better reflect its clinical nature.}

Recent comparative studies with closely related NHPs at the single-cell resolution using multimodal genomic profiling, assisted with high-throughput functional screening have provided unprecedented insights into human-specific brain features and their genetic underpinnings. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of human brain evolution at cellular and molecular levels, emphasizing how genetic changes have shaped these adaptations.

abstract = {Background
The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT; Google) and GPT (OpenAI), has introduced significant advancements in natural language processing. These models are increasingly integrated into various applications, including mental health support. However, the credibility of LLMs in providing reliable and explainable mental health information and support remains underexplored.
Objective
This scoping review systematically maps the factors influencing the credibility of LLMs in mental health support, including reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations. The review is expected to offer critical insights for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers, guiding future research and policy development. These findings will contribute to the responsible integration of LLMs into mental health care, with a focus on maintaining ethical standards and user trust.
Methods
This review follows PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. Eligibility criteria include studies that apply transformer-based generative language models in mental health support, such as BERT and GPT. Sources include PsycINFO, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. A systematic search of studies from 2019 onward will be conducted and updated until October 2024. Data will be synthesized qualitatively. The Population, Concept, and Context framework will guide the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers will screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies through discussion. Data will be synthesized and presented descriptively.
Results
As of September 2024, this study is currently in progress, with the systematic search completed and the screening phase ongoing. We expect to complete data extraction by early November 2024 and synthesis by late November 2024.
Conclusions
This scoping review will map the current evidence on the credibility of LLMs in mental health support. It will identify factors influencing the reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations of these models, providing insights for practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and users. These findings will fill a critical gap in the literature and inform future research, practice, and policy development, ensuring the responsible integration of LLMs in mental health services.

IVR has also been adapted for empathy training, but previous studies failed to consider various empathy types. We aimed to provide learners with personalized recommendations of empathy training content for different empathy types. Consequently, we presented Robot’s Dream, an IVR game suite providing personalized content based on the learner’s empathy type. We then conducted a mixed-method evaluation with 35 fifth and sixth-grade students who played Robot’s Dream and answered a post-test questionnaire on usability, user experience, and impact. The user study results demonstrated adequate usability and user experience with emotional engagement of the participants. However, the participants gave mixed reactions to realism and discomfort with the IVR hardware. The results also showed high perceived potential for empathy training and raising awareness of empathy. By retrospectively analyzing the development process and the user study results, we presented learned lessons and identified aspects in Robot’s Dream for future improvement. The presented development account of Robot’s Dream and the user study results can be helpful for educators, researchers, and developers interested in personalizing empathy training and other psychological training with IVR games.}

The presence of high signal intensity on T2 imaging and late gadolinium enhancement, in conjunction with intense metabolic activity at the mass site on positron emission tomography (PET), raised the possibility of an inflammatory or malignant mass. The diagnosis of IPT was confirmed by biopsy. Our case highlights the utility of PET imaging to confirm the inflammatory nature and extent of an IPT.}

Algorithmic tools are increasing users’ production capacity for literary and artistic works to almost infinite levels. However, the quality of the outputs is strictly dependent on the quantity and quality of the inputs, some of which are protected by copyright. This scenario gave raise to tensions between copyright holders and generative AI companies. While the formers claim control over this new kind of exploitation of their works, the latters wish to train their algorithms freely with as many contents as possible. This contribution suggests exploring the idea of introducing a statutory license for machine learning purposes as a compromise solution to ensure an attractive environment for artificial intelligence without marginalizing the role played by human authors. This remuneration proposal is rooted in a fundamental rights analysis that balances i.e., the right to science and culture and freedom of artistic expression (Arts. 11 and 13 EUCF, 19 UDHR, 27.1 UDHR, 15.1 a and b ICESCR) vis-à-vis the right for creators to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from their scientific, literary or artistic production (Arts. 17.2 EUCF, 27.2 UDHR, and 15.1 c ICESCR).}

abstract = {Background
Small-bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Given its rarity, clinical management often mirrors colorectal cancer (CRC), despite distinct molecular features and inferior outcomes. Although checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy has shown efficacy in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC, data on SBA remain scarce, and MMR testing is not routinely implemented.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective study of SBA patients treated with CPI at Copenhagen University Hospital—Herlev between March 2019 and January 2024. Radiological responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. We also analyzed the frequency of MMR testing and dMMR status in SBA patients.
Results
Among 148 SBA patients, 7 received CPI therapy. The objective response rate was 86%, with one (14%) complete response and five (71%) partial responses. Median progression-free survival was 31 months [median follow-up (mFU) 32 months]; median overall survival was not reached (mFU 33 months). Overall, 55% underwent MMR testing, and 18% of SBA patients were dMMR.
Conclusions
CPI therapy yields high, durable response rates in dMMR SBA, supporting dMMR as a predictive biomarker. However, inconsistent MMR testing strategy may limit access to optimal treatment. Routine molecular profiling and broader biomarker discovery are key to expanding CPI eligibility and improving outcomes.}

To contribute to this understanding, the objective of this work was to assess students’ perceptions of the widely diffused chatbot ChatGPT and its use as a learning tool. A mixed methodology was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses in a repeated cross-sectional study with an intervention. Data was collected from undergraduate students in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering across three different semesters. The qualitative evaluation indicated that the course level had no impact on students’ perceptions, and gender only influenced prior knowledge of ChatGPT, without affecting satisfaction or perceived usability. The strongest correlation was found between the perceived quality of the responses and overall satisfaction. Response quality was also a central theme in the qualitative data, with about 45 % of respondents noting that ChatGPT should be used cautiously due to its lack of accuracy in more complex tasks. The study also evaluated ChatGPT's specific applicability as a learning tool in courses focused on machining. In this context, students viewed its use positively when applied as a complementary aid. Ultimately, the results suggest that, regardless of students' prior familiarity with ChatGPT, most were able to use it effectively, demonstrated critical thinking regarding its use, and expressed willingness to adopt it as a complementary learning tool.}

abstract = {Purpose
LibQUAL is an international recognized tool for evaluating user satisfaction across three dimensions: Affect of Service, Information Control and Library as Place. With the rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in library systems, spanning both the Global South and North, there is a growing need to adapt LibQUAL to reflect these technological advancements. This study aims to advocate for a revision of LibQUAL to include a dedicated AI dimension that aligns with evolving service models.
Design/methodology/approach
This conceptual study draws on a comprehensive review of recent practices that highlights the increasing integration of AI technologies across diverse library contexts. This paper investigates how AI tools such as chatbots, recommendation systems and automated cataloguing are reshaping traditional library functions and user experiences.
Findings
This study proposes that LibQUAL should evolve to include a fourth dimension focused on AI services. This future-ready addition would enable libraries to assess the quality of AI-driven offerings, gather targeted feedback from users, identify service gaps and implement iterative improvements. Despite widespread AI adoption, no existing opinion piece or framework has thoroughly addressed the need for updating LibQUAL to reflect this AI shift.
Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is among the first to systematically argue for the integration of AI as a core evaluative category in LibQUAL. It contributes to both library assessment literature and strategic planning by offering a forward-looking approach to measuring service quality in an increasingly AI-reliant library environment.}

Structural, morphological, optical, electrical, and photoluminescence properties were comprehensively investigated. XRD confirmed monoclinic CuO structure and successful La incorporation, with crystallite size peaking at 6 at.% doping. SEM-EDS analyses revealed uniform surface morphology and verified elemental composition, while UV–Vis spectroscopy indicated doping-dependent bandgap modulation. Doping has enhanced optical absorbance and 8 at.% La doped CuO samples showed maximum absorbance. Raman spectra showed phonon confinement effects through redshifts and peak broadening. PL lifetime studies revealed the passivation of non-radiative recombination centers, particularly at moderate doping levels. First-principles simulations corroborated experimental observations, revealing charge redistribution and improved hole conductivity due to La substitution. These findings establish La doping as a viable strategy to engineer the optoelectronic properties of CuO thin films for photovoltaic and sensor applications.}

Grief is a complex and multifaceted process. While there is no reason to think that the grieving process would be dissimilar if an LGBTQ+ individual loses a partner than the grief of a heterosexual individual, they often receive and perceive less practical and emotional support, empathy and are treated unequally legally post loss. To date no studies have investigated whether this experience (disenfranchised loss) more likely leads to prolonged grief disorder or other mental health sequelae. This article describes aspects of disenfranchised grief, loneliness, and artificial intelligence for emotional support based on the personal experience of an older gay widower who was moderately depressed and lonely at the time of enrollment in a clinical trial for late-life bereavement and suicide risk.}

Starting from this proposal, the hypothesis extends further to the possible influence of PCSK9 CHRD SNVs on the development, therapeutic effects, and prognosis of cancer based on recently discovered roles of CD36 in tumour biology.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, hold promise for transforming medical education and physician training in response to increasing health-care demands and shortages in the global health-care workforce. Meanwhile, challenges remain in the effective and equitable integration of AI technology into medical education and physician training worldwide. This Viewpoint explores the opportunities and challenges of such an integration. We study the evolving role of AI in medical education, its potential to enhance high-fidelity clinical training, and its contribution to research training using real-world examples. We also highlight ethical concerns, particularly the unclear boundaries of appropriate use of AI and call for clear guidelines to govern the integration of AI into medical education and physician training. Furthermore, this Viewpoint discusses practical constraints, including human, financial, and resource constraints, in AI integration, and emphasises the need for comprehensive cost evaluations and collaborative funding models to support the sustainable implementation of AI integration. A tight collaborative network between health-care institutions and systems, medical schools and universities, industry partners, and education and health-care regulatory agencies could lead to an AI-transformed medical education and physician training scheme that ultimately supports the adoption and integration of AI into clinical medicine and potentially brings about tangible improvements in global health-care delivery.}

The main reason for this difficulty is that these standards are often extensive and are written in a manner that can be subject to different interpretations. This paper presents the development of an interactive interface that utilizes natural language processing techniques and adaptive learning algorithms for system modelers to interpret, comprehend, and access Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) standards and provide them with real-time context-aware guidance. This paper will detail the architecture of this tool and highlight how its integration will facilitate flexibility in the system modelling workflow.

Knowledge of the traits that influence tick resistance contributes to the development of breeding strategies designed to improve herd productivity. Within this context, this study evaluated the resistance of Caracu, a tropically adapted cattle breed, to R. microplus. Tick count, hair length, coat thickness, and coat color were evaluated in 202 naturally tick-infested females (cows and heifers) over a period of 18 months. Blood samples were collected from all animals during the winter season for hematological analysis. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlations, generalized linear models, and principal component analysis. Correlation coefficients of tick count with coat color, coat thickness, and hair length were estimated within each season. Hematological parameters were only included in the winter season analysis and were analyzed by the restricted maximum likelihood method using log-transformed data. No differences in blood parameters were observed between animals with and without ticks. However, tick count was negatively correlated with erythrocytes (−0.29) and hematocrit (−0.24) and positively correlated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.21) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (0.25). These findings suggest that higher tick counts lead to a decrease in erythrocytes but also to an increase in the amount of hemoglobin per erythrocyte, which could reduce the damage caused by low erythrocyte levels due to tick hematophagy, delaying or preventing anemia. Although tick infestation on pasture was demonstrated by the infestation of all staff members during herd management, none of the animals exhibited high tick counts, providing evidence of resistance of Caracu animals to R. microplus. Tick infestation was influenced by age class (cows > heifers), season (spring and summer > fall and winter), coat thickness (>1.5 mm > <1.5 mm), and hair length (>6 mm > <6 mm). Three components were extracted by principal component analysis, which accounted for 69.46% of data variance. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of efficient strategies aimed at reducing economic losses due to tick infestation and could be applied in animal breeding to select for tick resistance traits, reducing chemical control strategies and consequently improving sustainable livestock production.}

abstract = {Introduction
Distal femur fractures are commonly managed with retrograde femoral nailing or locked lateral plating (LLP). As implant design has evolved, more distal and complex patterns are being treated with intramedullary implants. The aim of the present study was to compare early outcomes in distal femur fractures managed with the novel DePuy Synthes RFN-Advanced (RFNA) Retrograde Femoral Nailing System to a similar cohort treated with locked lateral plating.
Patients and methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of operative distal femur fractures that presented to our Level I trauma center over a 7-year period. We included patients with AO/OTA types 33A2–3, 33C1–2 fractures treated with either the RFNA or a lateral locked plate over two distinct time points. Injury radiographs were reviewed independently by three orthopedic traumatologists to include only cases deemed “nailable.” Primary outcomes included coronal and sagittal alignment. Secondary outcomes included nonunion, surgical site infection (SSI), and unplanned reoperation.
Results
We identified 107 patients treated with either the RFNA (n = 45) or LLP (n = 62) over the 7-year study period. No significant differences were identified in the rates of sagittal (2.2 % versus 9.7 %, P = 0.12) or coronal malalignment (2.2 % versus 0 %, P = 0.421). The nonunion rate was 8.9 % in the RFNA cohort versus 19.4 % in the LLP cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.174). We also found no difference in infection or implant failure between groups. Screw backout occurred in 8 RFNA patients (17.8 %), with 7 patients undergoing screw removal (15.6 %) either in clinic (n = 5) or the operating room (n = 2).
Discussion and conclusions
This matched cohort study demonstrated promising results comparing the RFNA to lateral plating of distal femur fractures. The nonunion rate of 9 % in the RFNA cohort adds to recent literature that supports improved union rates with intramedullary nailing of these fractures. Interlocking screw backout was the most common complication with RFNA treatment at a rate of 16 %, with the majority removed in clinic.

abstract = {Aim
To evaluate student experiences with the Independent Authentic Clinical Reasoning Task (I-ACRT), an assessment designed to elicit unaided clinical judgment in nursing students by restricting generative AI use.
Background
AI tools are rapidly transforming nursing education. While they enhance access and efficiency, overreliance can impair independent reasoning. The I-ACRT was developed to preserve foundational clinical judgment by replicating authentic practice conditions while removing AI and peer input.
Methods
Student reflections were drawn from open-ended responses on end-of-course evaluations in a junior-level BSN course. Evaluations were anonymous and collected through a third-party platform. Comments explicitly referencing I-ACRTs were coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo. A total of 11 student responses met inclusion criteria. This study was an exploratory program evaluation using qulitative descriptive methodology and inductive content analysis.
Results
Four major themes emerged: (1) Cognitive adjustment, including initial frustration and increased fluency across attempts; (2) Desire for coaching, especially in preparation and feedback; (3) Desire for greater clarity in task expectations; and (4) Perceived benefit, with students noting gains in conceptual understanding and preparedness for clinical reasoning. Students described the I-ACRT as cognitively demanding but ultimately valuable when paired with structured support.
Conclusions
The I-ACRT is a feasible and effective model for assessing foundational clinical reasoning in an AI-restricted environment. While initial cognitive load was high, students improved over time and valued the realism and independence the task required. Findings support further refinement of the I-ACRT model as a tool for preparing students to critically engage with AI in clinical practice.}

Studied Co-rich microwire with vanishing magnetostriction coefficient presents high Giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect associated with excellent soft magnetic properties. Tensile stress was applied through the mechanical load, attached to the single Co-rich microwire sample inside the anechoic chamber and the S22 parameter was measured at 2.45 GHz using broadband horn antennas and a vector network analyzer. Upon tensile stress (up to 225 MPa), we observed a substantial change in the S22 parameter. The change in the S22 parameter correlates with the stress dependence of hysteresis loops. The experimentally discovered stress dependence of the reflection coefficient allows for contactless stresses and damage monitoring of composites with microwire inclusions.}

To test these associations, a user experiment was conducted. Findings suggest that due to differences in the uncertainty of data needs and the difficulty of data evaluation, when executing tasks with intellectual products, users devote more effort to data evaluation rather than query optimization and rely more on System 2. Moreover, due to differences in knowledge complexity and the availability of data resources, when performing multi-discipline tasks, users devote more effort to query optimization and data evaluation but gain lower search performance. When performing intellectual-multi-discipline tasks, data searchers use System 1 and System 2 in a complementary way to support systematic and efficient evaluation. A task classification has been developed, offering a framework to identify behavioral and cognitive patterns linked to specific tasks.}

We highlight how single-molecule imaging has transformed our understanding of biological processes, with a focus on chromatin organization and transcription in the nucleus. We describe how this was enabled by the close integration of new imaging techniques with analysis tools and discuss the challenges to make a comparable impact at larger scales from organelles to organisms. By highlighting recent successful examples, we describe an outlook of ever-increasing data and the need for seamless integration between dataset visualization and quantification to realize the full potential warranted by advances in new imaging technologies.}

In addition to standard older adult care services, mobile medical devices have proved to be an effective tool for controlling the health of older adults. However, little is known about the variables driving the acceptance of these gadgets and the willingness of older adults in China to use them.
Objective
This study aims to explore the factors that affect the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices by older adults in China, focusing on individual, social, and family influences.
Methods
The Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents survey database provided the data for this study. The survey was conducted in 148 Chinese cities between June 20 and August 31, 2022. The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree.
Results
In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support.
Conclusions
This study uses the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to investigate the effects of demand variables, enabling resources, and predisposing traits on older persons’ propensity to use mHealth devices. These results offer reference data for the marketing and use of mHealth devices for older individuals in the future. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to create a balanced and harmonious integration of technology and humanistic care.}

Analysis of spoken and written corpora has yielded helpful findings regarding the vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatic skills used by language learners and professionals in various disciplines. Corpus-based studies have explored differences in linguistic choices across professional workplaces and various communicative domains. While initial challenges existed in corpus collection and analysis, innovative approaches in the past 20 years have enabled richer comparisons and more practical applications for ESP. Future directions for corpus-informed ESP research include expanding data collection to new domains and modalities, developing annotation schemes to capture pragmatic nuances, building learner corpora, conducting pedagogical pilots, leveraging technological innovations, and exploring cross-linguistic comparisons. Continued collaboration between corpus linguists, ESP experts, language educators, and workplace professionals holds promise for advancing both theoretical and practical applications of corpora in ESP.}

abstract = {Introduction
Refractory prosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip remain a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context.
Materials and methods
Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported.
Results
Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18.
Conclusion
Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional.
