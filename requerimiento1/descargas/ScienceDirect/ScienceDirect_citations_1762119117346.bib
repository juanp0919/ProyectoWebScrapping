abstract = {This study aimed to determine the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in answering oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) multiple choice questions. A total of 259 questions from the university’s question bank were answered by the LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, Gemini, and Copilot). The scores per category as well as the total score out of 259 were recorded and evaluated, with the passing score set at 50%. The mean overall score amongst all LLMs was 62.5%. GPT-4 performed the best (76.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 71.4–82.2%), followed by Copilot (72.6%, 95% CI 67.2–78.0%), GPT-3.5 (62.2%, 95% CI 56.4–68.0%), Gemini (58.7%, 95% CI 52.9–64.5%), and Llama 2 (42.5%, 95% CI 37.1–48.6%). There was a statistically significant difference between the scores of the five LLMs overall (χ2 = 79.9, df = 4, P < 0.001) and within all categories except ‘basic sciences’ (P = 0.129), ‘dentoalveolar and implant surgery’ (P = 0.052), and ‘oral medicine/pathology/radiology’ (P = 0.801). The LLMs performed best in ‘basic sciences’ (68.9%) and poorest in ‘pharmacology’ (45.9%). The LLMs can be used as adjuncts in teaching, but should not be used for clinical decision-making until the models are further developed and validated.}

abstract = {Political misinformation is a growing problem for democracies, partly due to the rise of widely accessible artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). In response, social media platforms are increasingly considering explicit AI content labeling, though the evidence to support the effectiveness of this approach has been mixed. In this paper, we discuss two studies which shed light on antecedent cognitive processes that help explain why and how AIGC labeling impacts user evaluations in the specific context of AI-generated political images. In the first study, we conducted a neurophysiological experiment with 26 participants using EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) and self-report measures to gain deeper insights into the brain processes associated with the evaluations of artificially generated political images and AIGC labels. In the second study, we embedded some of the stimuli from the EEG study into replica YouTube recommendations and administered them to 276 participants online. The results from the two studies suggest that AI-generated political images are associated with heightened attentional and emotional processing. These responses are linked to perceptions of humanness and trustworthiness. Importantly, trustworthiness perceptions can be impacted by effective AIGC labels. We found effects traceable to the brain’s late-stage executive network activity, as reflected by patterns of the P300 and late positive potential (LPP) components. Our findings suggest that AIGC labeling can be an effective approach for addressing online misinformation when the design is carefully considered. Future research could extend these results by pairing more photorealistic stimuli with ecologically valid social-media tasks and multimodal observation techniques to refine label design and personalize interventions across demographic segments.}

abstract = {Background
Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL) is rare in patients diagnosed with antecedent multiple myeloma (MM). This study aimed to elucidate the clinical features and outcomes of patients with sALL after MM.
Methods
We conducted this population-based study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and retrospectively reviewed patients with sALL following MM treatment at our institution. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic factors for survival in patients with sALL.
Results
We identified 64,629 cases of MM (including 18 sALL from the SEER Plus 9 database, and three sALL from our institution). Younger patients with MM and those who received chemotherapy were at a higher risk of developing sALL. The novel agent era witnessed an increased incidence of sALL (post-novel agent era vs. pre-novel agent era: 0.31% [10/32,640] vs. 0.25% [8/31,989]) and shorter latency time (post-novel agent era vs. pre-novel agent era [median]: 51.5 vs. 74.5 months, P = 0.516), though the difference was not significant. The median age at sALL onset was 65 (range: 47–78) years. Significant cytopenia and absence of BCR/ABL fusion genes were common features in this patient population. The treatment of sALL is complicated by old age and poor performance status. The median survival of patients with sALL is 18 months, whereas those who received chemotherapy had significantly prolonged survival.
Conclusions
Patients with sALL combined with an antecedent MM, especially those with long-term exposure to immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, should be cautiously evaluated and managed with a comprehensive approach.}

Despite the outstanding achievements, mRNA vaccines still face challenges such as stringent storage requirements, insufficient antigen expression, and unexpected immune responses. Since the intrinsic properties of mRNA molecules significantly impact vaccine performance, optimizing mRNA design is crucial in preclinical development. In this review, we outline four key principles for optimal mRNA sequence design: enhancing ribosome loading and translation efficiency through untranslated region (UTR) optimization, improving translation efficiency via codon optimization, increasing structural stability by refining global RNA sequence and extending in-cell lifetime and expression fidelity by adjusting local RNA structures. We also explore recent advancements in computational models for designing and optimizing mRNA vaccine sequences following these principles. By integrating current mRNA knowledge, addressing challenges, and examining advanced computational methods, this review aims to promote the application of computational approaches in mRNA vaccine development and inspire novel solutions to existing obstacles.}

abstract = {Deep Gaussian process models typically employ discrete hierarchies, but recent advancements in differential Gaussian processes (DiffGPs) have extended these models to infinite depths. However, existing DiffGP approaches often overlook the uncertainty in kernel hyperparameters by treating them as fixed and time-invariant, which degrades the model’s predictive performance and neglects the posterior distribution. In this work, we introduce a fully Bayesian framework that models kernel hyperparameters as random variables and utilizes coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to jointly learn their posterior distributions alongside those of inducing points. By incorporating the estimation uncertainty of hyperparameters, our method significantly enhances model flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamic systems. Furthermore, we employ a black-box adaptive SDE solver with a neural network to achieve realistic, time-varying posterior approximations, thereby improving the expressiveness of the variational posterior. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other key performance metrics. This work not only provides a robust Bayesian extension to DiffGP models but also validates its effectiveness in handling intricate dynamic behaviors, thereby advancing the applicability of Gaussian process models in diverse real-world scenarios.}

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is commonly linked to liver fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. FIB-4, APRI, and NFS are used to predict fibrosis severity, but their accuracy and role in long-term outcomes remain unclear.
Objectives
This study evaluates the predictive value of these scores for fibrosis and assesses the incidence of de novo cirrhosis and survival outcomes in MASLD patients.
Methods
This retrospective, single-center study included 175 MASLD patients in our university medical center. The diagnostic performance of FIB-4, APRI, and NFS for advanced fibrosis (stage 3–4) was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with de novo cirrhosis and survival outcomes.
Results
The mean age was 49.9±14.1 years, and 54.9% were female. The median follow-up was 78 months. ROC analysis showed FIB-4 (AUC: 0.77) was the best predictor of advanced fibrosis, followed by APRI (AUC: 0.74) and NFS (AUC: 0.74). Multivariate analysis identified fibrosis stage (HR: 3.045, p=0.001) and hypertension (HR: 4.096, p=0.047) as independent predictors of de novo cirrhosis. Age (HR: 1.070, p=0.031), albumin (HR: 15.151, p<0.001), and HbA1c (HR: 1.589, p<0.001) were independently associated with survival.
Conclusion
FIB-4 was the most accurate predictor of advanced fibrosis. Fibrosis stage and hypertension were the strongest predictors of de novo cirrhosis. These findings highlight the importance of fibrosis staging and comorbidity management in MASLD.}

abstract = {Purpose
To examine the effectiveness of evaluating widefield swept-source OCT scans for detecting glaucoma progression compared with conventional circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT) measurements.
Design
Longitudinal study.
Participants
One hundred and fifty-six eyes with glaucoma from 115 participants.
Methods
This study included individuals seen over ≥2 visits that were 12 months apart and those who were also scheduled for retest visits within ≤1 month at the baseline and 12-month visits. A circumpapillary circle scan on spectral-domain OCT and a widefield 15×15 mm OCT volume scan were acquired from each eye at each visit. A total of 286 and 284 unique visit pairs were thus available, where OCT scans were obtained 12 months and ≤1 month apart respectively, serving as the case and control groups respectively. Widefield OCT scans from these visit pairs were evaluated by 2 graders, who assessed the ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and thickness difference maps for glaucoma progression, masked to the time difference between the 2 scans.
Main Outcome Measures
Percentage of eyes deemed as progressing at 95% specificity.
Results
Evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified >2 times as many eyes as progressing over a 12-month period (Grader 1 = 36.7%; Grader 2 = 38.1%) than cpRNFLT measurements from spectral-domain OCT (16.8%; P < 0.001 for both) at 95% specificity. For the subset of 96 (62%) eyes with a baseline visual field mean deviation (MD) ≥–6 dB, evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified ≥3 times as many eyes as progressing (Grader 1 = 41.1%; Grader 2 = 46.3%) compared with cpRNFLT measurements (13.7%; P < 0.001 for both). There was substantial between-grader agreement for the eyes identified as progressing on widefield OCT imaging (Gwet first-order agreement coefficient = 0.76). Evaluation of widefield OCT scans in a 2-arm trial seeking to detect a ≥30% treatment effect in 1 study eye, with 80% power, was estimated to reduce sample size requirements by 69% compared with cpRNFLT measurements, or by 80% when only including eyes with an MD ≥–6 dB.
Conclusions
Qualitative evaluation of widefield OCT scans showed an enhanced detection rate for structural progression than cpRNFLT measurements in glaucoma eyes.

abstract = {Background
Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most prevalent cancer and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Camrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated moderate efficacy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Lactobacillus paracasei, a probiotic bacterium, has a complementary effect in immunotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the combination of camrelizumab and L. paracasei for advanced ESCC.
Methods
This single-arm, single-center, exploratory trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. Eligible patients received 200 mg camrelizumab biweekly and two bags of L. paracasei twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs).
Results
From May 2020 to October 2022, ten patients with advanced ESCC who did not respond to first-line therapy were admitted. At the data cutoff date (August 9, 2023), the median follow-up duration was 12 months. Two of 10 (20%) achieved objective responses. The median survival was 7.5 months and the median OS was not reached. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in two of the 10 patients (20%). No serious treatment-related AEs or deaths occurred.
Conclusions
Camrelizumab combined with L. paracasei showed favorable anticancer activity and may be a viable second-line treatment for patients with ESCC.

The study population included 280 patients with severe asthma, aged 5 to 18 years, from the SAC (n = 56) and SDCs (n = 224). The SAC patients were more likely to be Black (79% vs 52% [P = .0002]), be non-Hispanic (100% vs 88% [P = .01]), have had at least 1 hospitalization (21% vs 10% [P = .04]), and have received at least 2 prescriptions for a systemic corticosteroid (34% vs 17% [P = .01]). Longitudinal outcomes among patients for the 12 months before SAC enrollment versus 12 months after SAC enrollment demonstrated significant reductions in acute exacerbations (from 35 to 8 [P < .001]), hospitalizations (from 21 to 1 [P < .001]), and intensive care unit admissions (from 8 to 1 [P = .02]).
Conclusions
The study highlights significant morbidity among predominately Black pediatric patients with severe asthma, particularly those followed in a SAC versus in SDCs at a tertiary care referral center. The findings demonstrate the value of targeted multidisciplinary approaches to reduce asthma utilization and improve outcomes among high-risk patients.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Avoiding unnecessary radiotherapy (RT) in patients with limited life expectancy requires accurate selection. Traditional survival models based on structured data often lack precision. Large language models (LLMs) offer a novel approach to structuring unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, potentially improving survival predictions by integrating comprehensive clinical information.
Materials and methods
We analyzed structured and unstructured data from 34,276 RT-treated patients at Yonsei Cancer Center. An open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data using single-shot learning. External validation included 852 patients from Yongin Severance Hospital. We compared the LLM’s performance against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models using statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches incorporated both structured and LLM-structured data.
Results
The open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data with 87.5 % accuracy, outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM (35.8 %). Larger LLMs were more effective in structuring clinically relevant features, such as general condition and disease extent, which correlated with survival. Incorporating LLM-structured features improved the deep learning model’s C-index from 0.737 to 0.820 (internal validation) and from 0.779 to 0.842 (external validation). Risk stratification was also enhanced, with clearer differentiation among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0.001). Additionally, models became more interpretable, as key LLM-structured features aligned with statistically significant predictors traditionally identified from structured data.
Conclusion
General-domain LLMs, despite not being fine-tuned for medical data, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHRs, significantly improving survival prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The RT-Surv framework highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance clinical decision-making and optimize RT treatment.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess the ability of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to generate accurate and relevant responses to the 2022 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).
Methods
Responses from ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to prompts derived from all 15 AAOS guidelines were evaluated by 7 fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons using a structured questionnaire assessing 5 key characteristics on a scale from 1 to 5. The prompts were categorized into 3 areas: diagnosis and preoperative management, surgical timing and technique, and rehabilitation and prevention. Statistical analysis included mean scoring, standard deviation, and 2-sided t tests to compare the performance between the 2 large language models (LLMs). Scores were then evaluated for inter-rater reliability (IRR).
Results
Overall, both LLMs performed well with mean scores >4 for the 5 key characteristics. Gemini demonstrated superior performance in overall clarity (4.848 ± 0.36 vs 4.743 ± 0.481, P = .034), but all other characteristics demonstrated nonsignificant differences (P > .05). Gemini also demonstrated superior clarity in the surgical timing and technique (P = .038) as well as the prevention and rehabilitation (P = .044) subcategories. Additionally, Gemini had superior performance completeness scores in the rehabilitation and prevention subcategory (P = .044), but no statistically significant differences were found amongst the other subcategories. The overall IRR was found to be 0.71 (moderate).
Conclusions
Both Gemini and ChatGPT-4 demonstrate an overall good ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to question prompts based on the 2022 AAOS CPG for ACLR. However, Gemini demonstrated superior clarity in multiple domains in addition to superior completeness for questions pertaining to rehabilitation and prevention.
Clinical Relevance
The current study addresses a current gap in the LLM and ACLR literature by comparing the performance of ChatGPT-4 to Gemini, which is growing in popularity with more than 300 million individual uses in May 2024 alone. Moreover, the results demonstrated superior performance of Gemini in both clarity and completeness, which are critical elements of a tool being used by patients for educational purposes. Additionally, the current study uses question prompts based on the AAOS CPG, which may be used as a method of standardization for future investigations on performance of LLM platforms. Thus, the results of this study may be of interest to both the readership of Arthroscopy and patients.}

abstract = {Background
Although chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is effective in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its efficacy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations remains unclear.
Methods
This retrospective analysis included 66 patients: 28 received chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, and 38 received chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was safety. In eligible patients with measurable disease, tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PFS was defined as the time from the first day of therapy to disease progression.or death from any cause.
Results
The median progression–free survival (mPFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.03—16.63 months) in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group and 6.23 months (95% CI: 4.53—7.07 months) in the chemotherapy alone group. There was a significant difference in efficacy between the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy and chemotherapy-alone groups (p < 0.001). Among the 25 patients evaluated for tumor response in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group, 11 (44%) achieved a partial response (PR), 8 (32%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (24%) had progressive disease (PD). The objective response rate (ORR) was 44%. Adverse events (AEs) included gastrointestinal reactions and myelosuppression. There were no significant differences in terms of safety between the two treatment groups.
Conclusions
First-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy was associated with significantly longer PFS than chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR ex20ins-mutant NSCLC, without increased toxicity.}

abstract = {Background
Falls represent a significant health burden among individuals with diabetes, yet the long-term relationship between diabetes status and fall risk remains inadequately characterized in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between diabetes status and incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative longitudinal data.
Methods
Utilizing China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011–2020 data, we included 9553 participants (aged ≥45 years) for a 9-year prospective cohort study. Diabetes was classified as normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or diabetes based on self-reported diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or HbA1c levels. Incident falls were assessed via self-reports across four survey waves from 2011 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were to evaluate the independent association between diabetes and falls and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
The study included 7131 (74.6 %) participants with normal glucose levels, 1254 (13.1 %) with prediabetes, and 1168 (12.2 %) with diabetes. Mean age was 58.1 ± 9.0 years, with 46.9 % males. Fall incidence rates were significantly higher in the diabetes group (55.1 %) compared to prediabetes (48.3 %) and normal glucose groups (47.3 %) (P < 0.001). After full adjustment for potential confounders, diabetes was associated with a 27 % increased risk of incident falls (OR=1.27, 95 % CI: 1.11–1.45, P < 0.001), while prediabetes showed no significant association (OR=0.99, 95 % CI: 0.87–1.12, P = 0.817). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in older adults aged ≥60 years (OR=1.45, 95 % CI: 1.18–1.78) compared to those <60 years (OR=1.17, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.39), with similar effects in both sexes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
Conclusions
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults, with a 27 % higher risk persisting after comprehensive adjustment. This association appears to be specific to established diabetes rather than prediabetes, suggesting a pathophysiological threshold effect. The findings support the integration of fall prevention strategies into routine diabetes care, particularly for older adults, and have important implications for clinical practice guidelines and public health policy in China's rapidly aging population.}

abstract = {Background
Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae. Reliable susceptibility testing is critical but challenging due to colistin’s complex pharmacodynamics and testing limitations. This study evaluates the performance of the Colistin Agar Test (CAT) against the gold standard Broth Microdilution (BMD) method.
Methods
Study was conducted after confirming stability of colistin in agar plate. A total of 150 non-duplicate clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae (103 colistin intermediate, 47 resistant) were tested using both BMD and CAT. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of these isolates was performed using VITEK-2. Quality control was ensured using CLSI-recommended strains. Statistical parameters including Categorical Agreement (CA), Essential Agreement (EA), Major Error (ME), Very Major Error (VME), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Cohen’s Kappa were calculated using BMD as reference.
Results
MICs ranged from 0.125-16 µg/mL (BMD) and 0.125–8 µg/mL (CAT). CA and EA for CAT were 96 % and 87.3 % respectively. ME and VME were 4.8 % and 2.1 %. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CAT were 97.9 %, 95.1 %, 90.1 %, and 98.9 % respectively. Cohen’s Kappa showed almost perfect agreement (0.91).
Conclusion
CAT demonstrated high agreement with BMD and showed promise as a screening tool for colistin susceptibility in K. pneumoniae. While BMD remains the gold standard, CAT offers a feasible alternative for routine use, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, resistant results by CAT should be confirmed with BMD to avoid false resistance reporting and potential therapeutic exclusion of colistin.}

abstract = {Background
The objective of this study was to assess the complication and re-operation rates, evaluate the risk of non-union, and describe the functional outcomes at last follow-up in children and adolescents after lower-limb malignant tumour resection and reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique.
Hypothesis
Weight-bearing resumption 6 weeks after the second stage of the induced-membrane procedure promotes bone healing.
Material and methods
The study included 13 patients (9 with osteosarcoma, 3 with Ewing's sarcomas, and 1 with alveolar sarcoma) managed between 2000 and 2020 by oncological femoral or tibial resection followed, at a distance from adjuvant chemotherapy, by reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique. Non-union was the primary outcome measure and the MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) lower-limb functional score was the secondary outcome measure. Mean follow-up was 6.1 years (range, 2.0–12.7). At last follow-up, mean age was 18.1 years (range, 11.0–26.0) and the mean MSTS score was 66.6% (37.0–93.0%).
Results
After the second reconstruction stage, 8 complications developed in 6 patients (46%). Either a complication or limb-length inequality required 12 re-operations in 8 patients (61.5%). Non-union occurred after reconstruction in 5 (38.5%) patients. Early resumption of 50% weight-bearing 6 weeks after reconstruction was associated with bone healing (p=0.02).
Conclusion
The non-union rate was 38.5%. Partial, 50% weight-bearing with two elbow crutches and an orthosis, if allowed by construct stability, may promote bone healing.

Notably, various in vitro gene assembly methods have been developed to simplify the construction of an expression-tunable library. However, in vitro gene assembly requires a tedious multistep construction process, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, in this study, we developed an automated one-step multigene assembly method for constructing an expression-tunable library based on in vivo homologous recombination. We optimized the shuttle vector for in vivo homologous recombination to improve the assembly efficiency. We also scaled down the whole assembly method for a high-throughput gene assembly. Finally, the developed method demonstrated the construction of the expression-tunable multigene library in the biofoundry. Therefore, this study offers a versatile strategy for parallel and high-throughput genetic engineering in synthetic biology.

This study examines the synergistic interplay between these two domains, highlighting their collective impact on enhancing the accuracy, accessibility, and efficiency of teledermatologic services. Teledermatology expands dermatologic care to remote and underserved areas, and AI technologies show considerable potential in analyzing dermatologic images and performing various tasks involved in teledermatology consultations. Such integration facilitates rapid, precise diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and data-driven insights. Our explorative study involved designing a GPT-based chatbot named “Dr. DermBot” and exploring its performance in a teledermatologic consultation process. The design phase focused on the chatbot's ability to conduct consultations autonomously. The subsequent testing phase assessed its performance against the backdrop of current teledermatologic practices, exploring the potential of AI and chatbots to simulate and potentially enhance teledermatologic health care. Our study demonstrates the promising future of combining teledermatology with AI. It also brings to light ethical and legal concerns, including the protection of patient data privacy and adherence to regulatory standards. The union of teledermatology and AI not only aims to enhance the precision of teledermatologic diagnoses but also broadens the accessibility of dermatologic services to previously underserved populations, benefiting patients, health care providers, and the overall health care system.}

abstract = {The addition of heavy rare earth elements to sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets through grain boundary diffusion techniques can significantly improve the coercivity of magnets with minimal reduction in remanence. The diffusion depth and distribution of the diffusion source are critical metrics for evaluating the efficiency of the diffusion process. Glow discharge mass spectrometry can sequentially strip layers of the magnet within a limited region to measure the concentration of the diffusion source at various depths. However, the accuracy is compromised by the multiphase nature of the base magnet material and the inhomogeneous distribution of the diffusion source. In contrast, electron probe microanalysis enables direct observation of the diffusion depth and distribution by analyzing diffusion cross-sections of the magnet. Coupled with digital image processing techniques, electron probe microanalysis allows high-throughput analysis of images to calculate concentration across depth intervals, establish depth-concentration relationships, and predict the concentration of heavy rare-earth elements at specific depths. Describing the distribution of diffusion sources presents a significant challenge. In this work, a probabilistic denoising diffusion model is proposed for the first time to quantify the distribution of the diffusion source. EPMA images were segmented into 3,700 distinct positions for model training. The trained model can generate diffusion images with the same distribution of heavy rare-earth elements at any position. By training on microscopic images of various magnets, the model establishes a profound correlation between magnet performance and microstructure, providing practical guidance for optimizing magnets or diffusion sources.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) is frequent, worsens prognosis and increases healthcare resources use and costs. This research aims to quantify the impacts of HF as a concomitant diagnosis with COPD.
Methods
Retrospective, observational study of consecutive patients aged 40 years or older who visited the emergency department (ED) during 2018 for COPD exacerbation. One-year clinical outcomes, resource utilization and costs were compared between those with and without HF, using the Clinical Outcomes, HEalthcare REsource utilizatioN, and relaTed costs (COHERENT) model.
Results
Among 2384 COPD patients, mean age was 75.7 years, 40.1 % women. Of these 35.1 % had concomitant diagnosis of HF. Patients with COPD and HF exhibited higher 1-year rates of mortality (31.2 % vs 19.2 %, p < 0.001), hospitalization (95.6 % vs 78.9 %, p < 0.001), readmission and return to ED. Adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity, HF was an independent predictor of mortality (HR, 1.25; 95 %CI, 1.03–1.50; p = 0.02). Also, HF coexistence was independently associated with a 42 % excess in mean 1-year healthcare cost (ratio of means, 1.42; 95 %CI, 1.24–1.63; p < 0.001), adjusted for age and comorbidities.
Conclusions
The concomitant diagnosis of HF in patients with COPD exacerbation is associated with increased 1-year risk of all outcomes, increased use of healthcare resources and almost a doubling in total costs. Specific multidisciplinary strategies targeting these patients may be needed to improve their outcomes and reduce costs.}

Personal protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers when exposed to aerosol-generating procedures in patients with airborne respiratory pathogens.
Aim
This study aimed to provide information regarding the level of airborne protection offered to nursing staff and other healthcare workers in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units (ICUs) 1 year into the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
Methods
In this cross-sectional survey, ICUs in Australia and New Zealand were asked to participate in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group Point Prevalence Program in June 2021. Sites were asked to contribute to questions regarding airborne protection offered to nursing staff and other healthcare workers.
Results
There were 51 participating sites. Negative-pressure bed space availability within participating ICUs included 24 with more than two, 15 with two, eight with one, and one ICU that did not have any. The median (interquartile range) number of different models and sizes of N95/P2 masks available to ICU staff was 6 (4–7). Of the 1018 nursing staff working that day in the units, 799 (78.5%) had at least one fit-tested N95/P2 mask in the correct size available. A total of 712 patients (461 medical and 251 surgical) were cared for by 700 bedside nurses in these ICUs. Overall, adequate airborne protection preparedness (airborne personal protective equipment training and fit-testing since the pandemic) was present in 548 (78.3%) bedside nurses.

Weather map recognition is a problem that is also featured in the Common University Entrance Test. If weather maps can be recognized, automatic grading and question generation become possible, leading to learning support. Furthermore, it is expected that weather commentary text can be automatically generated from weather maps. Therefore, weather map image recognition is an important task, but it requires not only recognizing time-series changes in local weather data but also recognizing information on large-scale weather patterns such as pressure pattern and making future predictions. In this research, we use ChatGPT4-Vision, a multimodal AI, to validate the recognition performance of weather map images. We investigate whether it can answer questions about weather maps from university entrance exams and generate weather commentary text from weather map images. By conducting multiple experiments with varying tasks and information in the prompts, and evaluating the accuracy of the generated commentaries, we propose and validate improvements in reading performance through prompt engineering.}

The idea of such a model is required to address (i) the dynamic nature of the ConsiGma™-25 tablet production line and its processes; (ii) the limited amount of data that is usually available at the early stage; and (iii) the need to analyse the framework’s behaviours. Therefore, the impacts of various process parameters of the different units of ConsiGma™-25 (e.g., wet granulation, drying, milling, blending and tabletting) are statistically investigated. Then, a dynamic self-adaptive framework based on radial basis functions is developed to represent the processes of the ConsiGma™-25 tablet production line and to predict the tablet strength which indicates the tablet quality and tabletability. The framework performance is then assessed in the space investigated in a way that facilitates the (i) consideration and assessment of new data points when they are available; and (ii) expansion of the space by considering areas that have not been represented. Validated on a set of experimental data, the proposed framework has successfully predicted the tablet strength with a 0.89 coefficient of determination. In addition, the dynamic self-adaptive paradigm has improved the value of the coefficient of determination by an overall average of 3.7 %.}

Rural community patients with acute stroke fhave worse outcomes compared to those in urban communities. This study determined the associations between agency type (rural, suburban, urban), patient care (compliance with American Heart Association [AHA] guidelines), and patient outcomes (discharge disposition).
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of patients with prehospital impression of suspected stroke and a final diagnosis of an acute stroke or TIA between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. Prehospital agencies were classified by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) score: urban (RUCA 1), suburban (RUCA 2-3), rural (RUCA 4-10). Descriptive statistics characterized the cohort. Multivariable regression analysis tested the association between agency type and discharge disposition while controlling for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, initial NIHSS, in-hospital intervention, and receiving facility type.
Results
Urban-, suburban-, and rural-based agencies varied in compliance with the AHA recommendations. Rural agencies had the lowest proportion of encounters with full compliance (2.0 %) compared to suburban (7.0 %) and urban agencies (11.0 %) (p < 0.01). Compared to patients transported by urban agencies, patients transported by suburban agencies had almost twice (1.78 times; 95 % CI, 1.19-2.65) the odds of discharge to hospice or death and 0.56 times (95 % CI, 0.38-0.84) the odds of discharge home after controlling for covariates.
Conclusions
Rural EMS agencies had the lowest proportion of full compliance with AHA prehospital stroke guidelines. Acute stroke patients transported by suburban EMS agencies were less likely to be discharged home and more likely to be discharged to death compared to patients transported by urban-based EMS agencies.}

abstract = {Background
Online accessible patient education materials (PEMs) are essential for patient empowerment. However, studies have shown that these materials often exceed the recommended sixth-grade reading level, making them difficult for many patients to understand. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to simplify PEMs into more readable educational content.
Objective
We sought to evaluate whether 3 LLMs (ChatGPT [OpenAI], Gemini [Google], and Claude [Anthropic PBC]) can optimize the readability of PEMs to the recommended reading level without compromising accuracy.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used 60 randomly selected PEMs available online from 3 websites. We prompted LLMs to simplify the reading level of online PEMs. The primary outcome was the readability of the original online PEMs compared with the LLM-simplified versions. Readability scores were calculated using 4 validated indices Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index. Accuracy and understandability were also assessed as balancing measures, with understandability measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Understandability (PEMAT-U).
Results
The original readability scores for the American Heart Association (AHA), American Cancer Society (ACS), and American Stroke Association (ASA) websites were above the recommended sixth-grade level, with mean grade level scores of 10.7,10.0, and 9.6, respectively. After optimization by the LLMs, readability scores significantly improved across all 3 websites when compared with the original text. Compared with the original website, Wilcoxon signed rank test showed ChatGPT improved the readability to 7.6 from 10.1 (P<.001); Gemini, to 6.6 (P<.001); and Claude, to 5.6 (P<.001). Word counts were significantly reduced by all LLMs, with a decrease from a mean range of 410.9-953.9 words to a mean range of 201.9-248.1 words. None of the ChatGPT LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate, while 3.3% of Gemini and Claude LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate. Baseline understandability scores, as measured by PEMAT-U, were preserved across all LLM-simplified versions.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance the readability of online PEMs while maintaining accuracy and understandability, making them more accessible to a broader audience. However, variability in model performance and demonstrated inaccuracies underscore the need for human review of LLM output. Further study is needed to explore advanced LLM techniques and models trained for medical content.}

abstract = {Background and Purpose
Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is an emerging technique for characterizing tissue microenvironments. Prior work has shown that daily qMRI during MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) detects differential responses to hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) within the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp). This exploratory study investigates whether subregions of HNSCC tumors show distinct qMRI responses to hypofractionated RT using contoured GTVp subregions and voxelwise data.
Materials and Methods
Eighteen subjects with advanced HNSCC underwent MRgRT with daily qMRI over 15 fractions (total dose 50, 55, or 60 Gy). Daily intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and relaxometry sequences were acquired on a 1.5 T MR-Linac. Median ADC, D, D*, f, T1, and T2 were calculated for concentric GTVp subregions and an intra-subject control contour in paraspinal muscle. Mixed effect models were fit for each parameter. Voxelwise analysis included quantile tracking, histograms, and paired tests over the length of RT.
Results
Significant changes (p < 0.05) were observed in ADC, D, f, T2, and T1 within GTVp subregions. ADC, D, f, and T2 changes were uniform, while T1 varied spatially. Spatial patterns were detected in ADC and T1, with marginal effects in D, f, and T2. Voxelwise analysis revealed significant changes in all parameters except D* after correction. ADC, D, and f increased consistently; T1 and T2 changes were quantile dependent. These trends may reflect biological processes such as declining cellularity, reperfusion, or edema.
Conclusions
In this exploratory study, qMRI detected spatial heterogeneity in HNSCC. These findings support its potential role in guiding biologically adaptive RT strategies.}

abstract = {Background
With the climbing incidence of type 2 diabetes, the health care system is under pressure to manage patients with this condition properly. Particularly, pharmacological therapy constitutes the most fundamental means of controlling blood glucose levels and preventing the progression of complications. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by factors such as treatment complexity, polypharmacy, and poor patient adherence. As new technologies, artificial intelligence and digital technologies are covering all aspects of the medical and health care field, but their application and evaluation in the domain of diabetes research remain limited.
Objective
This study aims to develop and establish a stand-alone diabetes management service system designed to enhance self-management support for patients, as well as to assess its performance with experienced health care professionals.
Methods
Diabetes Universal Medication Schedule (DUMS) system is grounded in official medicine instructions and evidence-based data to establish medication constraints and drug-drug interaction profiles. Individualized medication schedules and self-management programs were generated based on patient-specific conditions and needs, using an app framework to build patient-side contact pathways. The system’s ability to provide medication guidance and health management was assessed by senior health care professionals using a 5-point Likert scale across 3 groups: outputs generated by the system (DUMS group), outputs refined by pharmacists (intervention group), and outputs generated by ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4 group).
Results
We constructed a cloud-based drug information management system loaded with 475 diabetes treatment–related medications; 684 medication constraints; and 12,351 drug-drug interactions and theoretical supports. The generated personalized medication plan and self-management program included recommended dosing times, disease education, dietary considerations, and lifestyle recommendations to help patients with diabetes achieve correct medication use and active disease management. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the DUMS group outperformed the GPT-4 group in medication schedule accuracy and safety, as well as comprehensiveness and richness of the self-management program (P<.001). The intervention group outperformed the DUMS and GPT-4 groups on all indicator scores.
Conclusions
DUMS’s treatment monitoring service can provide reliable self-management support for patients with diabetes. ChatGPT-4, powered by artificial intelligence, can act as a collaborative assistant to health care professionals in clinical contexts, although its performance still requires further training and optimization.}

To evaluate the completeness and quality of open peer review reports from BioMed Central (BMC) journals for regression-based clinical prediction model studies in oncology, focusing on adherence to methodological standards, reporting guidelines, and constructive feedback.
Methods
We searched for published prediction model studies in the field of oncology, which were published in BioMed Central journals in 2021. Data extraction used the Assessment of review Reports with a Checklist Available to eDItors and Authors (ARCADIA) checklist (13-item tool assessing review quality) with additional criteria (eg, word count, focus of comments on manuscript sections). Two investigators independently evaluated all open peer reviews, with conflicts resolved involving a third researcher. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were applied.
Results
Peer reviews were brief (median: 243 words; range: 0–677), with 82.7% focusing on methods or results but rarely addressing limitations (<20%) or generalizability. No reviewers verified adherence to reporting guidelines (eg, TRIPOD); only one reviewer mentioned guideline use. Reviews prioritized superficial issues (67.3% focused on presentation) over methodological rigor (38.5% evaluated statistical methods). There are 19.2% suggested statistical revisions and <1% addressed protocol deviations or data availability.
Conclusion
Our findings show that peer reviews of prediction models lack depth, methodological scrutiny, and enforcement of reporting standards. This risks clinical harm from biased models and perpetuates research waste. Reforms are urgently needed, including implementing reporting guidelines (eg, TRIPOD+AI), mandatory reviewer training, and recognition of peer review as scholarly labor. Journals must prioritize methodological rigor in reviews to ensure reliable prediction models and safeguard patient care.}

abstract = {Background
Early-life gut microbial colonization is crucial for immune system development, but the efficacy of probiotic interventions during pregnancy or infancy in preventing allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic sensitization (AS) remains unclear. This systematic review synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing probiotics for AR and AS prevention.
Methods
Seven English and Chinese databases were systematically searched up to February 13, 2025. Eligible studies were RCTs with clearly defined probiotic interventions and specified AR or AS outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using fixed-effects models.
Results
Fourteen RCTs involving 5886 children were included. Probiotics did not significantly reduce the odds of AR at any age (≤ 1 year: ORp = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.46–1.15, P = 0.17; > 1 year: ORp = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.83–1.09, P = 0.46). However, probiotics significantly reduced AS odds in children over 1 year (ORp = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76–0.99, P = 0.04). Subgroup analyses revealed greater reductions in AS odds for postnatal interventions initiated after 6 months of age (ORp = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68–0.99, P = 0.04) and for combined prenatal-postnatal supplementation (ORp = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74–0.98, P = 0.03). Probiotics were also associated with transient increases in the abundance of targeted gut microbial strains.
Conclusion
Probiotics during pregnancy and/or infancy may reduce AS odds in children over 1 year and correlate with age-related changes in gut microbial composition but failed to reduce AR odds at any age.}

Today’s students seek education that is flexible, personalized, and closely aligned with their career goals. Curricular flexibility supports learner-centered education, promotes adaptability, and empowers students by shifting some decision-making from faculty to learners. Important nuances must be considered, including the type of flexibility applied and the degree to which learning can be made accessible and adaptable. Literature highlights several benefits, such as fostering self-reflection, promoting engagement, supporting well-being, and encouraging greater accountability for learning. However, barriers exist, including concerns about increased faculty workload, limited direct evidence of positive student outcomes, and the possibility of creating academic entitlement. The purpose of this commentary is to describe elements of curricular flexibility and present examples from higher education and health professions literature that can be implemented at the program level or within individual courses. Successful implementation requires thoughtful consideration of where structure remains essential and where intentional opportunities can be introduced to foster learner accountability and autonomy. Curricular flexibility is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and faculty should assess the feasibility and support provided at the institutional and program levels. Research within pharmacy education is needed to clarify the impact of flexible learning and identify additional ways to overcome the barriers described. By balancing flexibility with academic rigor and professional standards, educators can better prepare learners to work in a society that values autonomy and adaptability and offers multiple paths to success.}

abstract = {Purpose
Thyroid nodules are uncommon in children and adolescents but carry an increased risk of malignancy when present. The Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) is an adult-validated ultrasound-based risk assessment providing a prediction of malignant potential for thyroid nodules, thereby guiding recommendations for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Minimal data exist regarding the applicability of TI-RADS to predict malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules. This study aims to analyze the performance of TI-RADS for children and adolescents with thyroid nodules, hypothesizing that applying TI-RADS criteria would improve accuracy and reduce the number of recommended FNAB compared to American Thyroid Association (ATA) size criteria alone.
Methods
A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted including patients ≤21 years with a thyroid nodule by sonographic thyroid imaging between 2015 and 2020. TI-RADS scores were assigned at each institution by a pediatric radiologist trained in thyroid imaging and TI-RADS criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy of TI-RADS scoring were compared to existing ATA size-based recommendation for performing a FNAB. Accounting for relative size differences between adults and children, a novel PED TI-RADS category was developed and tested, recommending FNAB for thyroid nodules with a TI-RADS 3 and ≥ 1.5 cm, TI-RADS 4 and ≥ 1.0 cm, and TI-RADS 5 any feasible size.
Results
291 nodules from 260 patients (median age 14.9 years, 78.8% female) were assessed using TI-RADS. Applying adult TI-RADS criteria resulted in recommendation of FNAB for 35.1% of nodules, in contrast to 76.6% recommended by ATA guidelines (p < 0.0001) (Table). Utilizing the adult TI-RADS score ≥3 as an FNAB indicator resulted in 100% sensitivity and 28.5% specificity, with 0 cases of missed malignant nodules on pathology. When novel PED TI-RADS criteria were applied, 88 patients would have been spared an unnecessary FNAB with improved sensitivity and accuracy over ATA criteria.
Conclusions
The application of adult and PED TI-RADS scoring to thyroid nodules in pediatric patients enhances the accuracy of malignancy prediction compared to current American Thyroid Association size criteria alone. The utilization of PED TI-RADS scoring eliminated unnecessary biopsies in many children while not missing a single thyroid malignancy.

abstract = {Objective
Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) and myositis-associated antibodies (MAAs) are assessed in clinical neurology, serving as a non-invasive tool for the differential diagnosis of autoimmune myopathies. However, the presence of MSAs and MAAs in neurological disorders remains uncertain.
Methods
Retrospective analysis was conducted on 878 serum samples from the neurological laboratory of the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany. The EUROLINE Myositis Profil 3 (IgG) Line Blot was used for antibody evaluation (anti-Mi2, -Ku, -PM-Scl100, -PM-Scl75, -Jo1, -SRP, -PL7, -PL12, -EJ, -OJ, and -Ro52). Samples were categorized into 19 disease groups, with consideration for myositis-linked and non-myositis-linked diseases. Then, the distribution of positive findings and the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA were analyzed.
Results
Among 727 included line blots, 84 could be assigned to myositis-linked diseases (thereof 44 positive for MAA/MSA). MAA and MSA taken together were more frequently positive for the main group of myositis-linked disease (52.4 %) compared to the non-myositis-linked group (14.6 %, overall specificity 85.4 %). However, individual antibodies were specific, ranging above 97.5 %. False positive antibody results can also occur in neurological differential diagnoses such as muscle dystrophy or cramp fasciculation syndrome. Furthermore, the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA does not show a significant association with the presence of a myositis-linked disease for antibody-positive samples (p = 0.136).
Discussion
Testing MSA and MAA simultaneously may not be suitable as a primary screening method for myositis-linked diseases in clinical neurological groups. However, MSAs and MAAs may offer valuable diagnostic support, particularly in cases where myositis is strongly considered.}

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular and are playing an important role in providing accurate clinical information to both patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4.0, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot LLMs for responding to patient questions regarding refractive surgery.
Methods
The LLMs’ responses to 25 questions about refractive surgery, which are frequently asked by patients, were evaluated by two ophthalmologists using a 5-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. Furthermore, the DISCERN scale was used to assess the reliability of the language models’ responses, whereas the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level indices were used to evaluate readability.
Results
Significant differences were found among all three LLMs in the Likert scores (p = 0.022). Pairwise comparisons revealed that ChatGPT-4.0′s Likert score was significantly higher than that of Microsoft Copilot, while no significant difference was found when compared to Google Gemini (p = 0.005 and p = 0.087, respectively). In terms of reliability, ChatGPT-4.0 stood out, receiving the highest DISCERN scores among the three LLMs. However, in terms of readability, ChatGPT-4.0 received the lowest score.

abstract = {Background
Managing symptoms of chronic pancreatitis (CP) remains a significant challenge. Korean Red ginseng (KRG), a well-known herbal supplement, has shown potential benefits in various health conditions, prompting its investigation in CP patients.
Methods
We conducted a single-arm, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effect of KRG on quality of life in CP patients exhibiting mild symptoms, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score of 0 or 1. 40 patients were enrolled and assessed at baseline, as well as at 30, 90, and 180 days. The primary outcome was an improvement in CGI scores, with secondary outcomes including changes in Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Questionnaire (PEI-Q) scores.
Results
A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, and 39 participants were analyzed. Results showed significant improvements in CGI scores at all examined intervals (days 0–30, 0–90, 0–180; p < 0.05). The PEI-Q score also significantly improved from day 0 to day 180 (p < 0.05). Two adverse events (AEs) probably related to KRG were reported, and all AEs were improved with conservative managements.
Conclusion
KRG supplementation significantly improves quality of life in CP patients with mild symptoms. These findings suggest that KRG may be a beneficial adjunct therapy in this patient population. Further research is needed to explore KRG’s pharmacological mechanisms, its use in combination with other treatments, and its effects in patients with more severe symptoms.

abstract = {Background
Rural individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) experience challenges to anticoagulation adherence and self-management of the condition. We tested an intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, quality of life, and health care utilization in rural individuals with AF.
Methods
We randomized rural patients with AF receiving anticoagulation to receive a smartphone-based relational agent (for disease education and adherence guidance) and a heart rate and rhythm monitor for 4 months or a smartphone-based health education app. Adherence was determined with 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC), and secondary outcomes of quality of life and health care utilization from interviews and health records.
Results
The trial randomized 270 individuals 1:1 (median [IQR] age 73.1 [67.5–78.6]; 163 [60.4 %] female sex). Over the 4-month intervention, intervention participants used the relational agent a median of 101 (IQR: 72, 110) days. In an intention-to-treat analysis there was no significant difference in 12-month PDC between the intervention and control groups (median [IQR]: intervention 0.97 [0.89–1.00] versus control 0.97 [0.92–1.00]) or in PDC ≥0.80. Intervention participants were more likely to self-report anticoagulation adherence than control at 4 and 8 months (95.7 % vs 88.4 % and 93.0 % vs 78.8 %, respectively) but not at 12 months. There were no significant differences by assigned intervention for the other secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Randomization to the relational agent intervention was not associated with improved PDC at 12-months but with greater interim self-reported adherence compared to a control. This study demonstrates the successful use of a smartphone-based agent to address adherence among rural individuals with AF.}

Case studies have shown ChatGPT can run clinical simulations at the medical student level. However, no data have assessed ChatGPT’s reliability in meeting desired simulation criteria such as medical accuracy, simulation formatting, and robust feedback mechanisms.
Objective
This study aims to quantify ChatGPT’s ability to consistently follow formatting instructions and create simulations for preclinical medical student learners according to principles of medical simulation and multimedia educational technology.
Methods
Using ChatGPT-4 and a prevalidated starting prompt, the authors ran 360 separate simulations of an acute asthma exacerbation. A total of 180 simulations were given correct answers and 180 simulations were given incorrect answers. ChatGPT was evaluated for its ability to adhere to basic simulation parameters (stepwise progression, free response, interactivity), advanced simulation parameters (autonomous conclusion, delayed feedback, comprehensive feedback), and medical accuracy (vignette, treatment updates, feedback). Significance was determined with χ² analyses using 95% CIs for odds ratios.
Results
In total, 100% (n=360) of simulations met basic simulation parameters and were medically accurate. For advanced parameters, 55% (200/360) of all simulations delayed feedback, while the Correct arm (157/180, 87%) delayed feedback was significantly more than the Incorrect arm (43/180, 24%; P<.001). A total of 79% (285/360) of simulations concluded autonomously, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in autonomous conclusion (146/180, 81% and 139/180, 77%; P=.36). Overall, 78% (282/360) of simulations gave comprehensive feedback, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in comprehensive feedback (137/180, 76% and 145/180, 81%; P=.31). ChatGPT-4 was not significantly more likely to conclude simulations autonomously (P=.34) and provide comprehensive feedback (P=.27) when feedback was delayed compared to when feedback was not delayed.
Conclusions
These simulations have the potential to be a reliable educational tool for simple simulations and can be evaluated by a novel 9-part metric. Per this metric, ChatGPT simulations performed perfectly on medical accuracy and basic simulation parameters. It performed well on comprehensive feedback and autonomous conclusion. Delayed feedback depended on the accuracy of user inputs. A simulation meeting one advanced parameter was not more likely to meet all advanced parameters. Further work must be done to ensure consistent performance across a broader range of simulation scenarios.}

abstract = {Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) of the prostate uses ultrasound to thermally coagulate tissue under real-time MRI guidance. Real-time feedback from closed-loop MRI thermometry automatically controls treatment parameters to match tissue response in the prescribed ablation volume. The pivotal study of TULSA (“TACT”, NCT02766543), which included a low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) population, has reached the end of the 5-year follow-up duration. Here we report the safety and efficacy outcomes at 5 years
Methods
The TACT study enrolled 115 patients across 13 sites in 5 countries. Eligibility criteria included stage ≤ T2b, PSA ≤ 15 ng/mL, and Grade Group (GG) 1-2 disease. The protocol prescribed a single whole-gland TULSA treatment sparing the prostatic urethra and urinary sphincter, and repeat TULSA was not allowed. The primary endpoints were PSA reduction and adverse events, both assessed at 1 year. Histologic control on 10-core biopsy, and prostate volume reduction on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) were also assessed at 1 year. Other secondary endpoints, assessed to 5 years, included adverse events, quality of life, PSA, and the rate of salvage treatment.
Results
Baseline (median [IQR]) age and PSA were 65 (59-69) years and 6.3 (4.6-7.9) ng/mL, with ≥GG2 disease in 72/115 men. At 1y, median prostate volume decreased from 37.3 to 2.8 cc (92%); 94/111 (85%) were free of ≥GG2 disease. By 5y, median (IQR) PSA decreased to 0.6 (0.18-1.9) ng/mL (n=68); 25 (21.7%) received salvage treatment (10 prostatectomy, 11 radiotherapy, 3 ADT, 1 surgery+radiation) without unexpected complications. Early predictors of treatment failure by 5 years included 1y PSA (OR=3; CI[1.7,5.4]) and visible lesion on 1y mpMRI (OR=12; CI[4.4,34]) (both p≤0.001). Failure modes include undertreatment due to patient selection or targeting error, and misalignment caused by intraprocedural swelling/motion. By 5 years, 61/66 (92%) recovered pad-free continence; 80/92 (87%) preserved erections sufficient for penetration. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 12 men (10%), with no Grade≥4 event or rectal injury.
Conclusions
Effective disease control is durable to 5 years after a single TULSA procedure, with a favorable safety profile. Favorable preservation of genitourinary quality of life is also durable to 5 years. Treatment failure modes include screening and intraprocedural factors. While the pivotal study represents early experience with TULSA, the risk of failure is mitigated by modern protocols. Such protocols include best practices for screening for intraprostatic calcifications that can lead to undertreatment, refined strategies for device positioning, and thermal dose escalation to address undertreatment that is visible on intraprocedural imaging. Factors from intraprocedural imaging and early clinical follow-up can predict salvage therapy by 5 years.}

abstract = {Ice formation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells under subfreezing conditions affects mass and heat transfer in components, causing significant degradation in cell performance and a reduction in cell durability. In this study, the X-ray CT test is conducted, and the microstructure of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is analyzed and reconstructed. The experimental results show that the porosity distribution of gas diffusion layer is uneven through the thickness direction. Then, the three-dimensional model is established by considering heat transfer, phase change, and mechanical response. The mechanical behavior of gas diffusion layer and the critical transport parameters at subzero temperatures are investigated. The modeling results indicate that the magnitude of displacement decreases with ice content but increases with assembly pressure. At a high ice content and low clamping pressure, the displacement distribution tends to be more uniform. Moreover, with the combined effect of ice formation and clamping pressure in the gas diffusion layer, both the porosity and effective diffusion coefficient show pronounced declining variations with compression ratio, leading to higher mass transfer resistance and severe performance degradation. However, the effective thermal conductivity increases with the compression ratio, indicating the positive effect on heat transfer and more even temperature distribution in gas diffusion layer. These results reveal the profound effect of ice on the transport properties of gas diffusion layer and could be capable of providing a basis for obtaining accurate behavior of the cell.}

abstract = {Objectives
This review aimed to systematically analyze the technological frameworks, application scenarios, and outcomes of large language model-driven agents (LLMDAs) in nursing practice, and to summarize ethical, technological, and practical challenges, guiding future research and clinical implementation.
Methods
This scoping review was conducted following the JBI guidelines. Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, APA PsycNet, Cochrane Library, and Medline) were systematically searched for peer-reviewed English-language studies from inception until September 9, 2025. Eligible studies were screened by title and abstract, with full-text assessments conducted independently by two reviewers.
Results
Twenty-five studies published between 2023 and 2025 were included, involving nine countries, primarily China (n = 9) and the United States (n = 9). Technological architectures were categorized into three types: collaborative models for solving complex tasks through multi-agent division of labor; augmentative models to enhance the accuracy of information outputs; and interactive models focusing on natural interactions and robotic task execution. Application scenarios included clinical, home-based, and community care. Studies indicated that LLMDAs can enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient experience. Primary ethical challenges identified included data privacy, reliability of generated content, and ambiguous attribution of responsibility.
Conclusions
LLMDAs offer a novel paradigm for intelligent transformation in nursing care through integrative technological frameworks. They demonstrate considerable potential in enhancing clinical decision-making accuracy, efficiency of care delivery, and patient satisfaction. Addressing existing ethical, technical, and practical challenges is essential for facilitating broader clinical adoption.}

abstract = {Purpose
The increasing presence of traditional or new forms of robots at work demonstrates how the copresence of workers and robots might reframe work and workplaces and consequently arouse new human resource management (HRM) questions regarding how to manage the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. Based on a spatiotemporal perspective, this conceptual article examines the implication of new spatiotemporal dynamics of work, which are generated by the interaction between workers and traditional or new forms of robots that are driven by advanced digital technologies, for HRM.
Design/methodology/approach
The article begins by carrying out a selective review focusing on the studies that enhanced the comprehension of the digital-driven spatiotemporal dynamics of work. It then presents a spatiotemporal framework from which it examines the implications of digital-driven spatiotemporal work boundaries for HRM. The article ends by underscoring the theoretical and empirical importance of taking more interest in new spatiotemporal forms of work for developing the HRM of the future.
Findings
By developing the notion of workuniverses, which denotes the spatiotemporal boundaries generated by the act of working through the interaction between workers and different forms of robots, this research first develops a theoretical framework that discerns three forms of spatiotemporal dynamics forming workuniverses at different levels and two spatiotemporal arrays for managing the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. The HRM questions and ethical concerns generated by the formation of workuniverses are then revealed through four focuses: the management ethics in workuniverses, individuals' spatiotemporal well-being, collective spatiotemporal coordination and spatiotemporal change management in workuniverses.
Originality/value
This research provides an original perspective, which is the spatiotemporal perspective, to examine the new spatiotemporal dynamics that form workuniverses and the HRM questions and concerns generated by the increasing interaction between workers and different forms of digital-driven robots.}

abstract = {Purpose
Surveys to assess views about artificial intelligence (AI) of various diagnostic radiology constituencies have revealed interesting combinations of enthusiasm, caution, and implementation priorities. We surveyed academic radiology leaders about their views on AI and how they intend to approach AI implementation in their departments.
Materials and methods
We conducted a web survey of Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members between October 5 and October 31, 2023, to solicit optimism or pessimism about AI, target use cases, planned implementation, and perceptions of their workforce. P values are provided only for descriptive purposes and have not been adjusted for multiple testing in this exploratory research.
Results
The survey was sent to the 112 Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members and 43 responded (38%). Chairs were optimistic, with no statistical difference between views of AI in general versus generative AI. Chairs plan to implement AI to improve quality and efficiency (43 of 43, 100%), burnout (41 of 43, 95%), health care costs (22 of 43, 51%), and equity (27 of 43, 63%) and most likely will target the postprocessing (26 of 43, 60%), interpretation workflow (26 of 43, 60%), and image acquisition (18 of 43, 42%) steps in the imaging value chain. Chairs perceived that radiologists (36 of 43, 84%) and technologists (38 of 43, 88%) were not particularly worried about being displaced but saw trainees as slightly less confident (31 of 43, 72%). Free text responses revealed concerns about the cost of AI and emphasized trade-offs that needed to be balanced.
Conclusion
Radiology chairs are optimistic about AI and poised to tackle departmental challenges. Concerns about generative AI and workforce replacement are minimal.}

abstract = {Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with a high burden in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, are often limited by patient factors such as multifocal disease, poor pulmonary reserve, or central airway obstruction. This review explores bronchoscopic intratumoral injection as a novel, localized therapeutic strategy and assesses its feasibility in resource-limited settings. We conducted a narrative synthesis of recent literature on bronchoscopic intratumoral injection techniques, therapeutic agents, clinical outcomes, and implementation challenges. Additional focus was placed on the Indonesian healthcare context, particularly the infrastructure in West Sumatra. Bronchoscopic intratumoral injection delivers chemotherapeutic, immunologic, or gene-based agents directly into tumors using flexible bronchoscopy, including transbronchial needle injection, endobronchial ultrasound-guided injection, and cone-beam computed tomography. This approach achieves high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic toxicity, shifting the paradigm toward immune modulation and durable tumor control. Clinical outcomes include improved airway patency, lung function, symptom relief, and survival in patients ineligible for standard therapies. Feasibility in Indonesia is supported by existing clinical resources and agent availability. Despite challenges, such as limited access to advanced imaging, specialized equipment, and skilled personnel, bronchoscopic intratumoral injection may represent a promising investigational strategy in selected cases. Further research is warranted before routine clinical implementation can be contemplated. Strategies such as structured training and regional collaboration can bridge implementation gaps, aligning innovation with equitable lung cancer care in developing countries.
Resumen
El cáncer de pulmón sigue siendo la principal causa de mortalidad relacionada con el cáncer en el mundo, con una carga muy elevada en el Sureste Asiático, en particular en Indonesia. Los tratamientos convencionales—como la cirugía, la radioterapia y la quimioterapia sistémica—suelen verse limitados por factores asociados al paciente, como la enfermedad multifocal, la escasa reserva pulmonar o la obstrucción de las vías respiratorias centrales. En esta revisión se analiza la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica como una estrategia novedosa de tratamiento localizado y se evalúa su viabilidad en los entornos con recursos limitados. Se llevó a cabo una síntesis narrativa de la bibliografía reciente sobre las técnicas de inyección intratumoral broncoscópica, los fármacos, los resultados clínicos y las dificultades de aplicación. Se prestó especial atención al contexto sanitario indonesio, sobre todo a las infraestructuras de Sumatra Occidental. Con las inyecciones intratumorales broncoscópicas se administran antineoplásicos, inmunomoduladores o genofármacos directamente en los tumores mediante técnicas de broncoscopia flexible, como la inyección transbronquial con aguja, la inyección guiada por ecografía endobronquial y el TAC de haz cónico. De esta forma se consiguen concentraciones locales elevadas del fármaco con una toxicidad sistémica mínima, lo que supone un cambio de paradigma y permite la modulación inmunitaria y el control duradero del tumor. Los principales resultados clínicos son el aumento de la permeabilidad de las vías respiratorias, la mejora de la función pulmonar, el alivio de los síntomas y la supervivencia de pacientes que no cumplen los criterios para recibir los tratamientos habituales. La viabilidad de esta técnica en Indonesia se justifica por los recursos clínicos existentes y la disponibilidad de medicamentos. Pese a las dificultades, como el acceso limitado a las técnicas avanzadas de imagen, a los equipos especializados y al personal cualificado, la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica puede ser una estrategia experimental prometedora para casos seleccionados. Antes de proceder a su aplicación clínica sistemática es necesario realizar más estudios. Las dificultades de aplicación pueden mitigarse adoptando estrategias como la formación estructurada y la colaboración regional, para que la innovación redunde en un tratamiento del cáncer de pulmón más equitativo en los países en desarrollo.}

abstract = {Summary
The study of complex adaptive systems, pioneered in physics, biology, and the social sciences, offers important lessons for artificial intelligence (AI) governance. Contemporary AI systems and the environments in which they operate exhibit many of the properties characteristic of complex systems, including nonlinear growth patterns, emergent phenomena, and cascading effects that can lead to catastrophic failures. Complex systems science can help illuminate the features of AI that pose central challenges for policymakers, such as feedback loops induced by training AI models on synthetic data and the interconnectedness between AI systems and critical infrastructure. Drawing on insights from other domains shaped by complex systems, including public health and climate change, we examine how efforts to govern AI are marked by deep uncertainty. To contend with this challenge, we propose three desiderata for designing a set of complexity-compatible AI governance principles comprised of early and scalable intervention, adaptive institutional design, and risk thresholds calibrated to trigger timely and effective regulatory responses.}

Based on this analysis, the article argues that humans and AI need to work together to minimize errors, reduce risks, maximize performance, and enhance the attainment of organizational goals. Rather than viewing AI as a tool to reduce headcount, organizations should see it as an opportunity to enhance human work and maximize value for the organization by restructuring roles, workflows, and learning systems around the unique strengths of human employees and AI.

Creative problem-solving methods, in particular, present an intriguing means of researching AI’s capacity to identify problems within ambiguous situations, while also generating relevant, useful solutions that respond to authentic, real-world issues in a meaningful way. This paper examined the performance of three separate AI entries generated by GPT-4o as compared with 68 human team entries from students in grades 7–9 within the competitive World Solutions Challenge offered by the Future Problem Solving Program International (FPSPI). The three entries were blind-scored by trained human evaluators for measures of effectiveness, impact, humaneness, creative strength, and development of action plan. Though all three AI entries scored in the top 15 % for all measures, including achieving the top scores for effectiveness, impact, humaneness, development of action plan, and overall performance, the AI entries were not found to be significantly different than the student control group on the measure of creative strength. The results suggest that AI models like GPT-4 may approach human-like abilities on certain aspects of creative performance during a more comprehensive creative process than divergent thinking alone, providing new insight into the current creative strengths—and limitations—of existing AI models.}

Literature examining the impact of obesity on burn injury remains mixed. Previous examination of the National Burn Repository, now the BCQP, in obesity-related burn research is limited. The aim of this work was to provide an assessment of the BCQP dataset to examine the effect of obesity on burn-related outcomes.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective review of the BCQP dataset from 2015–2018 was conducted. The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included overall length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Patients were grouped as obese or non-obese and were further stratified by total body surface area burned (TBSA) for comparison purposes. Multiple logistic regression (MLG) was used to compare the effect of several independent variables on mortality, ICU LOS > 7days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000.
Results
Of 41,031 patients in the analysis, 3845 (9.37 %) were obese. Obese patients had a higher mean TBSA (p = 0.01), longer overall LOS (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), and total hospital costs (p < 0.001). MLG found obesity to be an independent predictor of ICU LOS > 7 days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000. Obesity was not an independent predictor of mortality in burn patients, even when stratified by burn size.
Conclusions
The presence of obesity in this dataset was not found to be a predictor of mortality for any burn size, but was a predictor of overall LOS, ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Including obesity-related variables in databases may improve analysis in obesity-related burn research.}

To explore how changes in planned retirement age, practice setting, and physician productivity may impact the workforce shortage in urology.
Methods
We compared data between the 2015 and 2022 American Urological Association census, a specialty-wide annual survey which collects data on demographics, practice patterns, and procedures from a representative sample of U.S. urologists. Workforce productivity was measured by the self-reported number of hours worked per week and patients seen per week. A novel formula was developed to demonstrate how planned retirement age and productivity impact the workforce’s production capacity.
Results
The total number of practicing urologists increased during the period from 2015 to 2022 (11,990 to 13,976), while the mean age of practicing urologists decreased slightly (55.0 to 54.5years; P < .002). During this period, the mean planned age of retirement for all urologists decreased from 68.9years to 67.7 (P < .001). Urologists in solo practice had a significantly higher planned age of retirement at 71.9years (P < .001) as compared to all other practice models. The number of patients seen per week for all urologists decreased from 78.7 to 72.9 (P < .001). The amount of hours worked per week remained relatively constant between the study periods. The maximum possible number of patients seen by the workforce prior to retirement increased by only 2.4% during the study interval.
Conclusion
Though the U.S. urology workforce is growing and the mean age is decreasing, decreases in planned retirement age and productivity may offset these gains and intensify the physician shortage for U.S. urologists.}

EULAR and ACR management guidelines were selected by rheumatologists based on their clinical relevance for decision-making and processed. A RAG system was implemented. To evaluate it, 10 questions per guideline were generated using ChatGPT 4.5. Answers to these were produced by ChatGPT-o3-mini with context retrieval (RAG) and without (baseline). Performance was assessed by an Large language model (LLM)-as-a-judge (Gemini 2.0 Flash) using a 5-point Likert scale across 5 dimensions: relevance, factual accuracy, safety, completeness, and conciseness; it also determined preference between the RAG and baseline responses. For validation, 2 rheumatologists independently evaluated a random sample of questions (15%) on the same domains. Statistical significance was established using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and binomial tests.
Results
Seventy-four guidelines were included, yielding 740 evaluation questions. The LLM-as-a-judge evaluation showed the RAG system significantly outperformed the baseline across all criteria (P < .001). Manual evaluation confirmed these findings (P < .001) for accuracy, safety, and completeness. The RAG system was significantly preferred by the LLM-as-a-judge in 92.8% of comparisons and by the human evaluators in 71.2% to 74.8% (P < .001).
Conclusions
Developing a RAG system integrating extensive EULAR/ACR rheumatology guidelines improves answer quality compared to a baseline LLM. This evaluation provides a robust foundation for reliable, artificial intelligence-driven clinical decision support tools designed to enhance evidence-based practice by providing clinicians with rapid, context-aware access to recommendations.}

abstract = {Purpose
Hand and wrist trauma is a frequent cause of emergency room (ER) visits. However, hospitals often lack immediate hand specialist coverage. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT in aiding in the diagnosis and patient management of upper extremity trauma.
Methods
Ten clinical vignettes depicting common hand and wrist emergency clinical situations were created by the senior author to represent a broad range of common upper extremity injuries. These were presented to plastic surgery residents and ChatGPT (version 4.0). The responder was tasked to provide a diagnosis, ER management, and definitive treatment plans for each vignette. Responses were collected and scored by two attending plastic surgeons, blinded to the source, on a scale of 0 (poor) to 30 (excellent). Univariate and linear regression models were utilized for analysis.
Results
A total of 16 resident responses (9 junior and 7 senior) and 16 ChatGPT responses were collected for each of the 10 clinical scenarios. ChatGPT had significantly higher total average scores (mean = 26.6 vs. 22.7, p < 0.05) and ER management scores (mean = 9.9 vs. 6.7, p < 0.05) when compared to residents. We did not find any notable differences in diagnosis or definitive treatment scores between residents and ChatGPT responses. However, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect smaller effect sizes in these areas. No apparent correlations between scores and resident year of training were observed.
Conclusions
ChatGPT provided clinically accurate diagnosis and management plans for upper extremity trauma. Implementing AI in trauma management has the potential to improve the management of hand and wrist trauma in emergency settings by serving as a diagnostic and clinical reference tool for emergency medical providers. However, their integration into clinical practice should be carefully evaluated and focused on complementing, and not replacing, traditional consults. Ultimately, these tools could alleviate the burden placed on ERs and limit reliance on hand consults.}

abstract = {Background
Most birthing people in the United States initiate lactation, but little is known about lactation practices in patients who are critically ill.
Research Question
What are the lactation rates and practices in adult patients in the ICU and what are potential barriers to lactation and resource use?
Study Design and Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of immediately postpartum patients in the ICU at an academic medical center between January 2018 and January 2024. Information regarding initiation, cessation, communication, and lactation consultant (LC) services were extracted and bivariate tests of association were conducted.
Results
Most immediately postpartum patients in the ICU initiated lactation (85% [87 of 102]), but only 70% (72 of 102) continued until hospital discharge. Documented lactation plans were present before delivery for 60% of patients, and a documented plan to initiate lactation before delivery was associated with increased odds of initiating lactation after delivery (OR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.96-43.3; P = .005). Although most patients (75%) saw LCs, less than 30% of patients saw LCs within 24 hours of delivery. An association between seeing an LC and continuing lactation until hospital discharge was found (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 1.77-12.7; P = .002). More than one-half of lactating patients received mechanical ventilation (55%), but nearly 20% of these intubated patients did not undergo milk expression while ventilated.
Interpretation
Most postpartum patients who are critically ill initiate lactation, but not all continue until hospital discharge. Having documented plans to lactate before delivery and seeing LCs were protective of lactation in the ICU, but many patients did not see LCs promptly. Additional gaps in care included lack of documentation and delays in lactation initiation in intubated patients. We hypothesize that these gaps may hinder patients who are critically ill from achieving their personal lactation goals, and steps should be taken to address and mitigate these challenges.}

In modern industrial and technological applications and collaborative edge intelligence, control systems are crucial for ensuring efficiency and safety. However, deficiencies in these systems can lead to significant operational risks. This paper uses edge intelligence to address the challenges of achieving target speeds and improving efficiency in vehicle control, particularly the limitations of traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in managing nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, such as varying road conditions and vehicle behavior, which often result in substantial discrepancies between desired and actual speeds, as well as inefficiencies due to manual parameter adjustments. The paper uses edge intelligence to propose a novel PID control algorithm that integrates Backpropagation (BP) neural networks to enhance robustness and adaptability. The BP neural network is first trained to capture the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. The trained network is then combined with the PID controller to form a hybrid control strategy. The output layer of the neural network directly adjusts the PID parameters (kp, ki, kd), optimizing performance for specific driving scenarios through self-learning and weight adjustments. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our BP neural network-based PID design significantly outperforms traditional methods, with the response time for acceleration from 0 to 1 m/s improved from 0.25 s to just 0.065 s. Furthermore, real-world tests on an intelligent vehicle show its ability to make timely adjustments in response to complex road conditions, ensuring consistent speed maintenance and enhancing overall system performance.}

abstract = {Background
Sex workers face an epidemic of violence around the world. However, violence against sex workers (VASW) is underreported, and sex workers hesitate to report to the police because they are frequently punished; therefore, an alternative for reporting is needed. Sex workers also face stigmatization from health care workers, further discouraging help-seeking behavior or reporting in health care facilities. Sex workers have been recipients of services from nongovernmental organizations, typically related to HIV and sexual transmission of infections, but violence remains underaddressed.
Objective
This study aims to apply human-centered design methods to adapt ReportVASW for use in the Middle East and North Africa and to evaluate the usability of the prototype interface and identify opportunities for improvement.
Methods
Evaluation methods included cognitive walkthrough and System Usability Scale by 9 potential end users, and heuristic evaluation by 2 informatics professionals and 2 service providers.
Results
This study explores ways to improve the trilingual prototype of ReportVASW, with particular attention to ways to improve the data collection tool. Multiple methods identified multiple issues to address. Heuristic analysis revealed 2 serious issues to address, with scores over 2.5 out of 4 in the tool used. The most serious problems identified in heuristic analysis were related to language, particularly the Arabic version. Translation issues were addressed before end user testing. End users were enthusiastic about the idea of a mobile tool to document VASW, provided it led to change. They gave ReportVASW a System Usability Scale of 91.4, above the 68 considered good. Even as end users were enthusiastic, they offered suggestions for improvement.
Conclusions
Many opportunities to improve the interface were identified. Most changes are not overly complex, and the majority involve adapting the language used and improving the translation. Development of the trilingual ReportVASW data collection tool for the Middle East and North Africa region is worth pursuing.}

The purpose of this study was to reconstruct 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images from single anteroposterior (AP) postoperative total hip arthroplasty (THA) X-ray images using a deep learning algorithm known as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and to validate the accuracy of cup angle measurement on GAN-generated CT.
Methods
We used 2 GAN-based models, CycleGAN and X2CT-GAN, to generate 3D CT images from X-ray images of 386 patients who underwent primary THAs using a cementless cup. The training dataset consisted of 522 CT images and 2,282 X-ray images. The image quality was validated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index measure. The cup anteversion and inclination measurements on the GAN-generated CT images were compared with the actual CT measurements. Statistical analyses of absolute measurement errors were performed using Mann–Whitney U tests and nonlinear regression analyses.
Results
The study successfully achieved 3D reconstruction from single AP postoperative THA X-ray images using GANs, exhibiting excellent peak signal-to-noise ratio (37.40) and structural similarity index measure (0.74). The median absolute difference in radiographic anteversion was 3.45° and the median absolute difference in radiographic inclination was 3.25°, respectively. Absolute measurement errors tended to be larger in cases with cup malposition than in those with optimal cup orientation.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of GANs for 3D reconstruction from single AP postoperative THA X-ray images to evaluate cup orientation. Further investigation and refinement of this model are required to improve its performance.}

abstract = {Background
Limited evidence is available comparing the modified transtibial (MTT) and transportal (TP) techniques in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and their impact on returning to sports participation. The objective was to analyze the outcomes after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL in recreational athletes with a 2-year postoperative follow-up, comparing the MTT and TP techniques, based on the method used to drill the femoral tunnel.
Hypotesis
The rate of return to sport would be comparable regardless of the surgical technique used.
Material and methods
A retrospective study was conducted with 66 patients who underwent arthroscopic monofascicular ACL reconstruction between September 2016 and March 2020. Patients aged between 16 and 50 years old, recreational athletes at Tegner levels 6 and 7, with a 2-year follow-up were included. Groups were established for comparative analysis (MTT vs TP) based on the method for drilling the femoral tunnel. The main outcome variable was the return to sport at the same level. Secondary variables included patient satisfaction evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and knee function according to the Lysholm scale.
Results
At 2 years of postoperative follow-up, the return to sport rate was 30.3 % in the MTT group and 33.3 % in the TP group (p = 0.791). There were no significant differences between both groups in patient satisfaction (p = 0.664) and knee function (p = 0.113).
Conclusion
Drilling the femoral tunnel with the MTT and TP techniques did not influence the rate of return to sport, patient satisfaction, and knee function in recreational athletes with 2 years of postoperative follow-up.

abstract = {Background
The effective implementation of personalized pharmacogenomics (PGx) requires the integration of released clinical guidelines into decision support systems to facilitate clinical applications. Large language models (LLMs) can be valuable tools for automating information extraction and updates.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of repeated cross-comparisons and an agreement-threshold strategy in 2 advanced LLMs as supportive tools for updating information.
Methods
The study evaluated the performance of 2 LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, in extracting PGx clinical guidelines and comparing their outputs with expert-annotated evaluations. The 2 LLMs classified 385 PGx clinical guidelines, with each recommendation tested 20 times per model. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with manually labeled data. Two prospectively defined strategies were used to identify inconsistent predictions. The first involved repeated cross-comparison, flagging discrepancies between the most frequent classifications from each model. The second used a consistency threshold strategy, which designated predictions appearing in less than 60% of the 40 combined outputs as unstable. Cases flagged by either strategy were subjected to manual review. This study also estimated the overall cost of model use and was conducted between October 1 and November 30, 2024.
Results
GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro yielded reproducibility rates of 97.8% (7534/7700) and 98.9% (7612/7700), respectively, based on the most frequent classification for each query. Compared with expert labels, GPT-4o achieved 93.5% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.90; P<.001) and Gemini-1.5-Pro 92.7% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.89; P<.001). Both models demonstrated high overall performance, with comparable weighted average F1-scores (GPT-4o: 0.929; Gemini: 0.935). The models generated consistent predictions for 341 of 385 guideline items, reducing the need for manual review by 88.6%. Among these agreed-upon cases, only one (0.3%) diverged from expert labels. Applying a predefined agreement-threshold strategy further reduced the number of priority manual review cases to 2.9% (11/385), although the error rate slightly increased to 0.5% (2/374). The inconsistencies identified through these methods prompted the prioritization of manual review to minimize errors and enhance clinical applicability. The total combined cost of using both LLMs was only US $0.76.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that using 2 LLMs can effectively streamline PGx guideline integration into clinical decision support systems while maintaining high performance and minimal cost. Although selective manual review remains necessary, this approach offers a practical and scalable solution for PGx guideline classification in clinical workflows.}

However, the rapid evolution of Agentic AI, including Generative AI (GenAI) agents, has outpaced a cohesive understanding of its applications, challenges, and strategic implications. This narrative review explores the role of Agentic AI in shaping an intelligent future, focusing on its key attributes—autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and learning ability—and its potential to transform organizational performance. We identify a research gap in synthesizing the diverse capabilities of Agentic AI (e.g., multimodal processing, hierarchical architectures, and machine learning outsourcing) and providing actionable strategies for adoption. The paper examines how Agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making, automates processes, and enhances efficiency through tools like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AutoGPT. It highlights the transition from assisted ("Copilot") to autonomous ("Autopilot") models and the importance of hierarchical agent structures for system coordination. Key contributions include a framework for organizations to formulate GenAI strategies, addressing business needs, tool selection, human resource training, and risk management. Findings reveal that Agentic AI significantly improves productivity, reduces costs, and drives innovation, though challenges such as privacy, security, and ethical concerns remain. Future research should focus on industry-specific case studies to deepen understanding, explore the ethical and social impacts (e.g., privacy, data security, labor market effects), and investigate the integration of Agentic AI with emerging technologies like quantum computing. This review provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners to leverage Agentic AI effectively while addressing its limitations and opportunities.}

Children and young people (CYP) with cerebral palsy (CP) may have multiple associated co-morbidities, including sleep disorders. Sleep disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, are more prevalent among CYP with CP compared to typically developing children due to several contributory factors. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) collectively represents several different pathologies, namely obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA), and hypoventilation. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to each of these pathologies. Sleep studies (either as polysomnography or cardiorespiratory polygraphy) allow the detection of effort and apnoea, with contemporaneous measurement of oxygen saturations (SpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcpCO2). Together these enable the diagnosis of SDB, and the delineation of OSA, CSA and/or hypoventilation. The multifactorial component of SDB among CYP with CP may require intervention ranging from conservative measures (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway, soft collar), surgical options (e.g. adenotonsillectomy), or the initiation of respiratory support. Respiratory support, delivered as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), has a key role in the management of SDB in children with CP though the journey can often be turbulent with a high failure rate. Nonetheless, CYP with CP are being increasingly commenced on respiratory support, often for reasons others than SDB, for example aiding airway clearance in order to reduce the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections. Open discussions between the parents and healthcare professionals are important in setting shared goals for CYP with CP, guided by the primary aim of improving quality of life.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Chronic kidney disease is highly prevalent in patients with heart failure (HF), increases clinical complexity, and worsens prognosis. This study quantitatively assessed the impact of renal dysfunction severity, including dialysis, on clinical outcomes, resource utilization, and costs in patients with HF.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study in adult patients with 1 emergency department visit or hospitalization with an HF diagnosis in a university hospital in 2018. One-year clinical outcomes, resources, and costs were compared with the COHERENT (Clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization and related costs) model according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60, 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and <15 (including patients on dialysis) mL/min/1.73 m2.
Results
Of 3274 patients with HF (median age, 84 years; 56% women), 1453 (44.4%) had eGFR ≥ 60. Lower eGFR levels were associated with higher 1-year mortality (20.4% in eGFR ≥ 60 vs 45.4% in eGFR 15 to 29; P<.001 for trend), rehospitalization, and new emergency department visits. Patients with eGFR <15 had the highest readmission rate (50.8%; P<.001 for trend). Days out of hospital without dialysis decreased from 292 (80.0%) in eGFR ≥ 60 to 184 (50.3%) in eGFR <15. Median cost per patient journey increased from €3960 (Q1-Q3, €1750 to €8410) with eGFR ≥ 60 to €9590 (Q1-Q3, €4140 to €28 520; P<.001) with eGFR <15, driven mainly by hospitalizations (84%-90% of total, except for eGFR <15, 59.0%).
Conclusions
Renal dysfunction severity was associated with progressively worse clinical outcomes, increased health resource utilization, and higher costs in patients with HF. Strategies are needed to improve outcomes and reduce costs in patients with HF and severe chronic kidney disease.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La enfermedad renal crónica es frecuente en pacientes con insuficiencia cardiaca (IC), complica su tratamiento y empeora el pronóstico. Este estudio evaluó el impacto de diferentes grados de disfunción renal, incluida la diálisis, en los resultados clínicos, el uso de recursos y los costes en pacientes con IC.
Métodos
Estudio retrospectivo en pacientes con diagnóstico de IC en urgencias o ingreso en un hospital terciario durante 2018. Se compararon resultados clínicos, recursos y costes a 1 año según la tasa de filtración glomerular estimada (TFGe) ≥ 60, 30-59, 15-29 y <15ml/min/1,73 m2 (incluida la diálisis), con el modelo COHERENT (Clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization and related costs).
Resultados
De 3.274 pacientes con IC (mediana de 84 años; el 56% mujeres), 1.453 (44,4%) tenían una TFGe ≥ 60. Los valores de TFGe menores se asociaron a mayor mortalidad (el 20,4% en TFGe ≥ 60 y el 45,4% en TFGe 15-29; p de tendencia <0,001), más reingresos y nuevas visitas a urgencias. Los pacientes con TFGe <15 presentaron la mayor tasa de reingresos (50,8%; p de tendencia <0,001). Los días de vida fuera del hospital sin diálisis disminuyeron de 292 (80,0%) en TFGe ≥ 60 a 184 (50,3%) en TFGe <15. El coste medio por paciente aumentó de 3.960 euros (Q1-Q3, 1.750-8.410) con TFGe ≥ 60 a 9.590 euros (Q1-Q3, 4.140-28.520; p <0,001)) con TFGe <15, impulsado principalmente por la hospitalización (el 84-90% del total, excepto en la TFGe <15, que fue del 59,0%).
Conclusiones
La enfermedad renal crónica grave en pacientes con IC se asocia con peores resultados clínicos, mayor uso de recursos y costes mucho más altos. Se necesitan nuevas estrategias para mejorar resultados, y reducir costes en pacientes con IC y enfermedad renal crónica grave.}

Based on ChatGPT we verify the manipulative behavior of complex expressions and sentiment word substitutions. Our research suggests that using ChatGPT with appropriate cue words can help alleviate tone manipulation in financial texts, with GPT-4 having a better effect.}

It employs a mixed-methods content analysis to analyse textual AI data from the annual reports of 80 UK non-financial corporations listed in the FTSE100 index (2020 to 2023). Results reveal an increasing trend among UK corporations to disclose AI narratives. This study finds that FTSE100 corporations employ a blend of ‘assertive’ and ‘defensive’ impression management tactics in AI disclosures to influence stakeholder perceptions and maintain their legitimacy. Findings also indicate a significant post-crisis shift from defensive to assertive AI disclosures, underscoring how FTSE100 corporations strategically adapted their impression management tactics to reinforce pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how impression‑management tactics shape AI legitimacy, offering practitioners strategies for transparent communication, informing legislators on ethical AI regulation, and enabling stakeholders to interpret AI disclosures as indicators of corporate conduct.}

abstract = {Intelligent search engines including pre-trained generative transformers (GPT) have revolutionized the user search experience. Several fields including e-commerce, education, and hospitality are increasingly exploring GPT tools to study user reviews and gain critical insights to improve their service quality. However, massive user-review data and imprecise prompt engineering lead to biased, irrelevant, and impersonal search results. In addition, exposing user data to these search engines may pose privacy issues. Motivated by these factors, we present ChatReview, a ChatGPT-enabled natural language processing (NLP) framework that effectively studies domain-specific user reviews to offer relevant and personalized search results at multiple levels of granularity. The framework accomplishes this task using four phases including data collection, tokenization, query construction, and response generation. The data collection phase involves gathering domain-specific user reviews from public and private repositories. In the tokenization phase, ChatReview applies sentiment analysis to extract keywords and categorize them into various sentiment classes. This process creates a token repository that best describes the user sentiments for a given user-review data. In the query construction phase, the framework uses the token repository and domain knowledge to construct three types of ChatGPT prompts including explicit, implicit, and creative. In the response generation phase, ChatReview pipelines these prompts into ChatGPT to generate search results at varying levels of granularity. We analyze our framework using three real-world domains including education, local restaurants, and hospitality. We assert that our framework simplifies prompt engineering for general users to produce effective results while minimizing the exposure of sensitive user data to search engines. We also present a one-of-a-kind Large Language Model (LLM) peer assessment of the ChatReview framework. Specifically, we employ Google’s Bard to objectively and qualitatively analyze the various ChatReview outputs. Our Bard-based analyses yield over 90% satisfaction, establishing ChatReview as a viable survey analysis tool.}

Various soldering methods were employed, including reflow, laser, and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) soldering. When reflow soldering was performed for a relatively long time, coarse solder microstructures and interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) grains were formed. Laser and IPL soldering, which have rapid heating/cooling times, formed fine solder microstructure and thin interfacial IMCs. Then, it was confirmed that Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs were formed at the SAC305/OSP (organic solderability preservative) interface and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, Ni–Sn–P, and Ni3P were formed at the SAC305/ENEPIG (electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold) interface. An observation of the IMC grain morphology under various soldering conditions revealed that (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 was formed on the ENEPIG substrate, which was polygonal and smaller than on the OSP substrate. The shear strength of the joint increased in the order of reflow, laser, and IPL soldering. Additionally, ductile fractures occurred under all conditions. The IPL soldering joint had a thinner IMC compared to reflow soldering, and moderate interface roughness and bonding area compared to laser soldering. Based on the obtained results, a next-generation IPL soldering method is proposed to improve the properties of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joints.}

This study evaluated the accuracy and comprehensibility of responses from three large language models (LLMs)—ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot—when addressing patient queries about myopia. Accurate, understandable information is crucial for effective patient education and management of this common refractive error.
Methods
Sixty questions across six categories (definition, etiology, symptoms and diagnosis, myopia control, correction, and new treatments) were presented to ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot. Responses were assessed for accuracy by two experienced ophthalmologists using a 3-point Likert scale. Quality and reliability were evaluated using the DISCERN and EQIP scales, while readability was measured with the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Coleman-Liau Index. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.
Results
ChatGPT-4 provided the most accurate responses in the defsinition, symptoms, and diagnosis categories, with a 75 % overall success rate. Copilot had a similar success rate of 73.3 % but the highest inaccuracy rate (6.7 %). Gemini had a 71.7 % success rate. Copilot scored highest in reliability (DISCERN 76) and readability (Flesch Reading Ease 46.74), followed by ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. No significant differences in accuracy were found among the LLMs across categories.
Conclusions
All three LLMs performed well in providing myopia-related information. Copilot excelled in readability and reliability despite a higher inaccuracy rate. ChatGPT-4 and Copilot outperformed Gemini, likely due to their advanced architectures and training methodologies. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in patient education and the need for ongoing improvements to ensure accurate, comprehensible AI-generated health information.}

The importance of patient education has become increasingly apparent in recent years. A prominent patient education tool in neurosurgery is the Neurosurgical Conditions and Treatments page provided by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). This study aimed to investigate the readability of this resource page as many new articles have been incorporated in the past decade.
Methods
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease scores were calculated for each article. One-way analysis of variance and Scheffé, Tukey-Kramer, Bonferroni, Fisher least significant difference, and Dunnett test post hoc analyses were conducted to determine differences between each category with respect to their mean grade level and reading ease scores.
Results
Overall mean (SD) Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score was 40.2 (12.24), and overall mean (SD) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score was 7.48 (1.26). Significant differences were found between mean reading ease scores between each categorization by the AANS (P = 0.014). No significant differences were found between mean grade level score for each categorization (analysis of variance, P = 0.154).
Conclusions
As compared to a single previous investigation conducted 10 years ago, the readability of articles has changed modestly, and the reading grade level remains well above the recommendations by the American Medical Association and National Institutes of Health. The 6 new articles introduced in the past decade have demonstrated similar readability, presenting a persistent challenge in the realm of patient education in neurosurgery.}

However, limited research has explored children’s experiences, perceptions, needs, and values of these systems. This study applied a child-centered approach to understand how children experience and perceive ITSs, and what kind of design they desire and need in these systems. To achieve this, we conducted a questionnaire and a three-week co-design workshop, based on the Collaborative Design Thinking approach, with 56 children aged 12–14 from a Chinese middle school. Our findings explored children’s current experiences and perceptions about ITSs and identified various desired design features expected by children, including involving students and teachers in the loop, providing both cognitive and affective scaffolding, conducting ethical data practices and open resources, enabling social and multimodal engagement, and offering personalized digital tutors with incentive mechanisms. The results provide crucial insights for designing ITSs to support children's learning autonomy and data autonomy in these systems, entailing multimodal and affective interactions beyond the current systems, and balancing parental engagement and teacher involvement with these systems.}
