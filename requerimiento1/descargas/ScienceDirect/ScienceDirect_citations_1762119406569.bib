abstract = {Global economic growth has entered into the recovery phase of the economic cycle that is resilient yet slow, while the main culprit lies in the lower growth of green total factor productivity (TFP) caused by climate change intensification. It is imperative to formulate unconventional productivity models that can simultaneously solve ecological concerns and the crucial challenges posed by low innovation-driven productivity. This research aims to explore how and whether artificial intelligence (AI) as a critical dynamic capability to strengthen the development of firms' new quality productive forces (NQPFs). Based on the sample of Chinese manufacturing listed companies from 2011 to 2022, our findings show that AI promotes the development of firms' NQPFs; green innovation mediates the AI–NQPFs relationship, while economic policy uncertainty (EPU) moderates the above-mentioned mediating mechanism. Theoretically, our research extends Marx's view of productive forces to create a new construct of advanced productivity in China. Considering AI as a critical dynamic capability, we also provide insights into how productive forces are formed by human intelligence and AI. Practically, our findings help policymakers and practitioners reduce the impact of EPU caused partly by climate changes through AI usage and thereby predict the next trend of sustainable development.}

However, one region where our knowledge regarding the extent of RME is still limited is Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Bringing together a team of scholars (currently or formerly) based throughout the region, we were able to conduct the largest survey to date of RME practices in the CEE region, covering 13 countries. Our findings suggest that, at a declarative level, RME is very much present at CEE universities and business schools, in particular in terms of teaching. However, a pro-RME rhetoric is not necessarily backed-up with substance; in particular, a lack of financial resources was identified as the major barrier to greater engagement with RME practices. We also observed a gap between commitment to RME in teaching versus in research, which could be a potential source of concern as teaching should be informed by research; otherwise faculty remain dependent on imported teaching materials. We contribute to strengthening the RME agenda in management education by discussing the implications of our findings for individual faculty, business school leaders, governments and international associations of management education.}

Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.}

Hypothesis formulation is a creative process fundamental to scientific exploration, and there is an increasing interest in using generative AI to augment humans in this regard. This study explores the potential of large language models, particularly ChatGPT, to generate viable hypotheses within experimental materials science. Focusing on the subdomain of surface passivation of hybrid perovskites, our aim is to identify untested molecules capable of reducing surface recombination and thereby boost the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. By utilizing ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and formulate new hypotheses, we identify polyallylamine (PAA) as a potential surface modifier, which is a molecule we would not have considered otherwise. Subsequent experimental investigations demonstrate PAA to indeed be effective in decreasing recombination rates and improving device efficiency. This demonstrates a potent synergy between human expertise and AI capabilities also in more intellectual and intuitive facets of the scientific process, such as hypothesis generation.}

abstract = {L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the treatment of choice for Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor symptoms, but its chronic use is hindered by complications such as dyskinesia. Pre-clinical studies discovered that activation of metabotropic glutamate type 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) receptors alleviates L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. To gain mechanistic insight into the anti-dyskinetic activity of mGlu2/3 activation, we performed autoradiographic binding with [3H]-LY-341,495 in brain sections from L-DOPA-treated 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats that developed mild or severe dyskinesia, as well as L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned and sham-lesioned animals. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats showed a decrease in [3H]-LY-341,495 binding in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, 30 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05), globus pallidus (GP, 28 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 23 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001), and primary motor cortex (49 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 45 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001). Severely dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited an increase in binding in the primary motor cortex (43 % vs mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.05). In the contralateral hemisphere, mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats harboured a decrease in binding in the EPN (30 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 24 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05), GP (34 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 23 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001), and primary motor cortex (50 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 44 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05). Severely dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats presented a decrease in binding in the GP (30 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 19 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05). Abnormal involuntary movements scores of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals were positively correlated with [3H]-LY-341,495 binding in the ipsilateral striatum, ipsilateral EPN, ipsilateral primary motor cortex and contralateral primary motor cortex (all P<0.05). These results suggest that alterations in mGlu2/3 receptor levels may be part of an endogenous compensatory mechanism to alleviate dyskinesia.}

We introduce here for the first time how a formulation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method capable of modeling plate tectonics, with the introduction of plastic non-linear rheology, is able to reproduce the breaking of the upper boundary layer of the convecting mantle in plates. Numerical simulation of the earth’s mantle and lithospheric plates is a challenging task for traditional methods of numerical solution to partial differential equations (PDE’s) due to the need to model sharp and large viscosity contrasts, temperature dependent viscosity and highly nonlinear rheologies. Nonlinear rheologies such as plastic or dislocation creep are important in giving mantle convection a past history. We present a thermal Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) as an alternative to PDE-based solutions for simulating time-dependent mantle dynamics, and demonstrate that the LBM is capable of modeling an extremely nonlinear plastic rheology. This nonlinear rheology leads to the emergence plate tectonic like behavior and history from a two layer viscosity model. These results demonstrate that the LBM offers a means to study the effect of highly nonlinear rheologies on earth and exoplanet dynamics and evolution.}

An online survey consisting of both closed and open questions was completed by 263 respondents, comprising undergraduate students, taught postgraduates, postgraduate researchers, and academic staff at the university. Quantitative data was used to generate a descriptive overview of the research sample and to contextualise the interpretation of qualitative data. Qualitative data from the open questions was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis to generate the themes presented in this paper. Quantitative data revealed a wide range of both digital and non-digital methods for reference management. While most respondents had tried using at least one type of reference management software, use of software was higher among postgraduate researchers and academic staff than undergraduates and taught postgraduates. Three themes were generated from the qualitative data: practices are unique and contextual; practices develop over time; and reference management software forms part of wider practice. Exploration of these themes led to recommendations for librarians to incorporate this understanding of reference management practices into information literacy teaching.}

Over the past few decades, there has been a growing awareness of the variability in microbial interactions, and various studies are already unraveling the inner working dynamics in microbial communities. This has prompted scientists to develop novel techniques for characterizing the varying interspecific interactions among microbes. Here, we review the precise definitions of pairwise and high-order interactions, summarize the key concepts related to interaction variability, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of emerging characterization techniques. Specifically, we found that most methods can accurately predict or provide direct information about microbial pairwise interactions. However, some of these methods inevitably mask the underlying high-order interactions in the microbial community. Making reasonable assumptions and choosing a characterization method to explore varying microbial interactions should allow us to better understand and engineer dynamic microbial systems.}

abstract = {Building digital twins (DTs) are essential for enhancing operational efficiency, optimizing energy consumption, and reducing costs in buildings. However, the inherent complexity of buildings, their long operational lifespans, and the specific nature of the construction industry pose significant challenges in creating digital twins for buildings. Intelligent digital twins (IDTs) address these challenges by integrating existing digital twin models with AI, enabling a comprehensive representation of the building lifecycle while incorporating expert input. This study proposes an AI agent-based IDT framework using an ontological approach, where AI agents are engineered by DT administrators with building operations and maintenance (O&M) data, information, and applications within an ontological DT environment. Data and information generated within this environment are expressed in the DT ontology, enabling AI agents to gain a holistic understanding of the target system. Applications are integrated as a tool, thereby enabling AI agents to expand their actions and gain additional information from results. To validate this framework, virtual in-situ modeling (VIM) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms were implemented as DT applications to demonstrate the operation of the IDT system. Four case studies were conducted to demonstrate IDT-enabled O&M services, and LangSmith was used to visualize the AI agents' reasoning process as part of the result validation. It shows that AI agents have capabilities of performing building O&M tasks with high-level reasoning. The significance of this study lies in demonstrating the feasibility of implementing IDT models in building O&M by enabling AI agents to provide comprehensive, domain-specific knowledge and perform operational tasks, thereby serving as an assistant for both users and operators. Finally, this study underscores the critical role of engineers in managing and maintaining ontology and applications within the DT environment.}

Therefore, we introduce GridGAN to uncover the inherent patterns in the data and facilitate the grid partitioning for free-form surfaces. First, we innovatively propose utilizing the curvature and height cloud maps of free-form surfaces as inputs to GridGAN to obtain the corresponding grid structures. Then, we utilize self-developed codes to facilitate the data dimension conversion and obtain the desired free-form grid structures.

However, little research has investigated how the readability of these reviews impacts film performance. This paper examines the relationship between the readability of reviews on online platforms and movie market outcomes, including box office revenue, audience ratings, and popularity. We collected a dataset of 116,771 Chinese-language reviews from the Douban platform for 224 movies released in China between January 2019 and September 2022. Using natural language processing techniques, we calculated various readability metrics for each movie’s reviews. We then analyzed how these readability scores correlated with the movies’ economic and ratings performance. The results show that movies with more readable reviews tend to have higher box office returns, better audience reviews, and larger viewership. However, this effect is weakened when movies receive coverage from more authoritative official media sources or when the movies are not entertaining enough. We also find that the number of “useful” upvotes on reviews partially mediates the relationship between readability and movie outcomes. This study contributes novel insights into how the linguistic features of user-generated content can impact the success of digital entertainment products. The findings can help platforms design more effective review systems and assist studios in marketing movies online. Future work could extend this approach to other domains like book reviews or video game feedback.}

abstract = {Organizational information security performance is increasingly dependent on employees’ security-related citizenship behaviors that stretch beyond the scope of formal organizational prescription and control. Unfortunately, cultivating enactment of these valued behaviors has proven challenging for many companies. The literature has recognized workplace relationships as important determinants of behavioral security outcomes and extra-role security behaviors (ERBs) in particular. Taken further, an employee's relationship with the immediate supervisor is recognized as one of the most influential relational factors shaping a variety of workplace behaviors, including those related to security. Consistent with these notions, scholars have called for making the employee-supervisor relationship a more central component of behavioral security research and practice. Currently however, beyond recognition of this relationship's importance, the knowledge base is unclear about how it shapes ERB enactment. Because employees view supervisors as both organizational agents and as individuals in their own rights, this relationship has the potential to drive productive or counterproductive security behaviors, depending on how aligned the supervisor's security values are with those of the organization. Yet, the security literature has given surprisingly little consideration to the notion that employees can differ in the extent to which they perceive supervisors as embodying organizational information security values. Responding to this gap, the current study examines how employee-supervisor relations and perceived security-related value alignment between supervisors and the broader organization shape employees’ commitment to organizational information security and ultimately, ERB enactment. Grounded in the social identity theory of leadership (SITL), a research model is developed that positions high-quality employee-supervisor exchange as a direct antecedent of affective commitment to organizational information security, which then serves as a central intrinsic motivational mechanism driving ERB enactment. Further, rooted in SITL's principles on leader prototypicality and supervisor organizational embodiment, employee-perceived value alignment between the immediate supervisor and the organization as a whole—referred to here as supervisor security embodiment (SSE)—is introduced as a critical boundary condition influencing the extent to which employee-supervisor relations drive commitment. Results from model testing empirically demonstrate the value of SSE in explicating how this important relationship shapes workplace ERB enactment, through its influence on affective commitment to organizational information security performance.}

abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) opens new perspectives for sociology by automatically processing large amounts of textual data. Through a series of case studies, the chapter shows the potential of two main types of NLP techniques, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, with a focus on word embedding in the latter. In the context of supervised learning, the challenges of coding, the sociological interpretability of prediction performance, the importance of model interpretation, and the problem of causal inference are discussed. Through examples, it is demonstrated that automated solutions cannot replace the researcher, highlighting the relevance of domain knowledge and, more generally, the importance of aligning methodological paradigms at the intersection of data science and social science.}

abstract = {Under the protection of windproof structures, wind speed along high-speed railway (HSR) lines decreases while turbulence intensity increases, particularly in transition segments between different windproof structure types. Considering the challenges of placing trackside sensors and the lengthy computational time required for numerical simulations, we propose a novel predictor that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with neural network (NN) methodologies to estimate internal wind speed signals in real-time based on external measurements from the windproof structures. This architecture combines an echo state network with a dynamic reservoir (dESN) as a feature extractor and a memory-enhanced long short-term memory (eLSTM) network as the output module. It is characterized by a dataset from an experimentally validated delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES)-based CFD model. Applied to a segment of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway crossing the Baili windy zone, the predictor achieves over 85% accuracy in estimating in-plane wind speeds and vertical wind profiles, outperforming conventional methods. Additionally, it demonstrates effectiveness under extreme conditions, including exceedingly high incoming flow speeds, absence of downstream measurement points, and sparse or distant sensor arrangements.}

Following a sequential mixed methods design, we analyzed 384 survey responses and 10 semi-structured interviews with postsecondary writers. Findings suggest that the major learning task that the learners used ChatGPT for writing is brainstorming and seeking inspiration for ideas. While the entering motivation for using ChatGPT varies from curiosity about innovative technologies to fulfilling academic requirements, such entering motivation transformed into task motivation when the learners perceived the potential benefits of ChatGPT for assisting their writing. In terms of self-management, participants mostly demonstrated a high responsibility towards their own learning with ChatGPT and employed various strategies for SDL. Although survey respondents demonstrated a comparatively low level of self-monitoring, most interviewees claimed that they critically reflected on their learning process and validated information provided by ChatGPT. There are mixed opinions regarding whether the writing skills have improved as a result of using ChatGPT. Some participants suggested that the benefits brought by ChatGPT, such as alleviating social pressure and receiving instant feedback at any time, encouraged them to spend more time practicing writing and making revisions. However, some argue that assessing their AI-assisted SDL learning progress in the short term is challenging. This study addresses gaps in the existing literature where there is scarce, large-scale empirical research on self-directed AI usage in writing, shedding light on the emerging phenomenon of utilizing generative AI as a means of SDL in writing.}

abstract = {Adaptive social regulation refers to students' strategic adaptation of social regulatory actions in response to challenges. If group members enact social regulation strategies to cope with encountered challenges, adaptive social regulation occurs; if not, maladaptive behavior may arise. Adaptive social regulation contributes to effective collaboration, but two obstacles may hinder this process: (a) a lack of challenge awareness and (b) insufficient social regulation strategies. Research indicates that the combination of group awareness support and collaboration scripts could be a promising approach to foster adaptive social regulation. A current limitation is that previous studies have mainly focused on fostering the regulation of just a very limited set of specific challenges, neglecting the promotion of students' awareness and regulation of multiple challenges during collaborative learning. Therefore, this study proposes a combined group awareness support and collaboration scripts tool, referred to as CACS. The research was conducted in a semester-long authentic English academic writing course. Thirty-two postgraduates were randomly assigned to five groups using the CACS tool (experimental condition) and five groups without it (control condition). This study not only quantitatively validates the effectiveness of combining group awareness support with collaboration scripts in enhancing adaptive social regulation, but also qualitatively explores the underlying mechanisms through interviews. The quantitative findings demonstrate that the groups in the experimental condition showed improvements in challenge awareness, adaptive social regulation, and the overall adoption of social regulation strategies. The qualitative analysis identifies key features of group awareness support and collaboration scripts that contribute to adaptive social regulation, including increasing students’ knowledge of challenges, facilitating a shared understanding of challenging situations, and encouraging the adoption of social regulation strategies through effective reflection.}

In this study, such contact is simplified as a multi-indenter problem, and a thermo-chemo-mechanically coupled phase-field fracture model is developed based on the classical PF-CZM to investigate the indentation fracture of SSEs near the anode side of ASSBs. Based on the thermodynamic principles, the energy dissipation inequality, constitutive equations, and conservation equations for the thermo-chemo-mechano-damage coupling system are derived. The present model is validated to be effective through comparisons with literature results and analytical solutions. The simulation results of indentation fracture show that the distributions of temperature and concentration fields are affected by the cracks, while the crack evolution is influenced by thermal loads, chemical loads, and pre-existing defects. Moreover, the distribution of the concentration field during indentation fracture is mainly affected by both the negative hydrostatic stress and boundary concentration condition, and the compressive hydrostatic stress in the contact region makes its concentration lower than that outside the contact boundary. The simulations of multiple indenters indicate that the distance between indenters has a significant influence on fracture patterns, and reducing the contact asperity gap between the SSE and the lithium metal can significantly mitigate crack initiation and propagation caused by non-uniform contact. This study provides new insights for predicting the fracture failure of SSEs under thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling, and is helpful for optimizing the structural design of SSEs.}

First, through human coding, we determine whether student essays submitted as homework were created by humans or software, and second, we examine these essays' sentiment and authorship, as well as factors determining the use of artificial intelligence in learning. Data collection was conducted in April and May 2024 across thirty classes from twenty Hungarian high schools. Our results show that 16 % of high school students (N = 548) wrote their text-based homework assignments using artificial intelligence, though neither age nor parents' average educational level determined the use of AI in learning. Although women have more positive attitudes toward using AI for learning purposes, they are less likely to use it to complete their homework assignments. Finally, we found that fears related to artificial intelligence are general and lack specificity. Our findings have three practical implications: 1) they highlight the need for targeted educational programs to develop ethical AI use, 2) they assist teachers in identifying AI-generated texts, and 3) they draw attention to gender differences in AI usage.}

The results suggest that artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability positively affects the two countries' data-driven culture and environmental performance. Contrary to our expectations, we found the effect of data-driven culture on environmental performance to be not significantly different from zero for the USA sample. Moreover, while the data-driven culture for the French sample partially mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability and environmental performance, only a direct link between artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability and environmental performance could be verified for the USA Case. Our study advances the emerging literature on artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability, bringing originality by showing that in an artificial intelligence-enabled dynamic capability context, data-driven can vary according to both the country's national culture hosting the firms/supply chains and the dynamics and changes of such environment. Therefore, scholars should rely on such findings to bring more insights to practitioners and policymakers.}

This study introduces an experimental framework to simulate partial dam-break waves triggered by partial gate openings. We conducted numerous experiments to explore how different factors, including water-level differences (hi), reservoir widths (L), dam-break openings (e), and submerged depths (hw) influence the characteristic heights of the main-wave peak (h1c), subwave peak (h2c), and main-wave trough (h1t). Our analysis led to the development of an equation for predicting h1c. Furthermore, we compared the partial dam-break wave profile with the theoretical profile of a solitary wave, identifying optimal conditions for solitary wave generation and examining the velocity characteristics of partial dam-break waves. The results reveal that: (1) h1c, h2c, and h1t have positive correlations with hi and L, but negative correlations with e and hw; (2) notably, the main-wave pre-peak profile aligns more closely with the solitary wave theory; and (3) the solitary wave theory accurately predicts the main-wave peak velocity. This study enhances our understanding of wave characteristic evolution during partial dam-breaks and can be used for validation in numerical simulations.}

The methotrexate adsorption capacity of the DDS was 673.001 ± 4.518 mg/g. The copolymer acted as a gatekeeper, regulating the entry and exit of methotrexate from the pores. The DDS exhibited minimal methotrexate leakage at high pH levels but showed a significantly increased release at lower pH levels, demonstrating a pH-controlled drug release pattern. Mathematical modeling indicated that diffusion played a major role in drug release, and the DDS functioned as a reservoir system with a declining release rate over time. Importantly, the DDS displayed significant cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by MTT assays. Furthermore, the methotrexate-loaded DDS showed remarkable efficacy in killing MCF-7 cells, suggesting that folic acid facilitates DDS-specific targeting of MCF-7 cells via folic acid receptors.}

This review aims to provide an overview of novel diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals tested recently or used currently in genitourinary cancers within prospective phase 1–2 clinical trials, summarizing progresses and future directions.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for original prospective research studies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.
Key findings and limitations
Forty-six papers were systematically reviewed; 74 ongoing clinical trials were identified. The results of 27 novel radiopharmaceuticals (ie, not approved by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency and not listed in the Pharmacopeia) prospectively investigated in genitourinary cancers, mostly prostate, for diagnostic, theranostic, or therapeutic purposes (21, one, and five of the 27 radiopharmaceuticals, respectively) over the past 5 yr were presented. Most were prostate-specific membrane antigen–targeting agents (17/27); other targets included gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, carbonic anhydrase IX, Cu, six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1, tumor-associated glycoprotein 42, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Ongoing research confirms the same trend. Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor, PD-L1, CD8, nectin-4, and HER2 are other targets under investigation. Among the 22 ongoing therapeutic trials (out of the 74 ongoing clinical trials), targeted alpha therapy is being explored in 12, and five are evaluating combinations of radioligand therapy with other treatments. We confirmed the safety of radiopharmaceuticals (regardless of the diagnostic/therapeutic purpose) and showed promising results in terms of diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy in genitourinary cancers.
Conclusions and clinical implications
There continues to be expansion in radiopharmaceutical approaches to genitourinary cancers, reflecting a strong emphasis on improving tumor detection and treatment, which will likely impact future management across the disease spectrum, with the potential for improved patient care and outcomes.}

In SAGINs, aerial facilities, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), collect multi-modal sensory data to support diverse applications including surveillance and battlefield monitoring. However, these processing of the multi-domain inference tasks require large artificial intelligence (AI) models, demanding powerful computing capabilities and finely tuned inference models trained on rich datasets, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To provide ubiquitous powerful computation, we propose a SAGIN model collaboration framework, where LEO satellites with ubiquitous service coverage and ground servers with powerful computing capabilities work as edge nodes and cloud nodes, respectively, for the processing of sensory data from the UAVs. With limited communication bandwidth and computing capacity, the proposed framework faces the challenge of computing allocation among the edge nodes and the cloud nodes, together with the uplink-downlink resource allocation for the sensory data and model transmissions. To tackle this, we present joint edge-cloud task allocation, air-space-ground communication resource allocation, and sensory data quantization design to maximize the inference accuracy of the SAGIN model collaboration framework. The mixed integer programming problem is decomposed into two subproblems, and solved based on the propositions summarized from experimental studies. Simulations based on results from vision-based classification experiments consistently demonstrate that the inference accuracy of the SAGIN model collaboration framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.}

abstract = {Background
More people who smoke and are living with HIV now die from tobacco-related diseases than HIV itself. Most people are ambivalent about quitting smoking and want to quit someday but not yet. Scalable, effective interventions are needed to motivate and support smoking cessation among people ambivalent about quitting smoking (PAQS) who are living with HIV.
Objective
This study aims to develop an app-based intervention for PAQS who are living with HIV and assess its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. Results of this study will inform plans for future research and development.
Methods
In phase 1, PAQS living with HIV (n=8) participated in user-centered design interviews to inform the final intervention app design and recruitment plan for a subsequent randomized pilot study. In phase 2, PAQS living with HIV were randomized to either a standard care control app or a similar experimental app with additional content tailored for PAQS and those with HIV. Participants were followed for 3 months. Feasibility focused on recruitment, retention, and participants’ willingness to install the app. The study was not powered for statistical significance. Indices of acceptability (satisfaction and use) and impact (smoking behavior change and treatment uptake) were assessed via automated data and self-report among those who installed and used the app (n=19).
Results
Recruitment for both study phases was a challenge, particularly via web-based and social media platforms. Enrollment success was greater among people living with HIV recruited from a health care provider and research registry. Once enrolled, retention for the phase 2 randomized study was good; 74% (14/19) of the participants completed the 3-month follow-up. Phase 1 findings suggested that PAQS living with HIV were receptive to using an app-based intervention to help them decide whether, when, and how to stop smoking, despite not being ready to quit smoking. Phase 2 findings further supported this conclusion based on feedback from people who agreed to use an app, but group differences were observed. Indices of acceptability favored the experimental arm, including a descriptively higher mean number of sessions and utilization badges. Similarly, indices of potential impact were descriptively higher in the experimental arm (proportion reducing smoking, making a quit attempt, or calling free tobacco quitline). No participants in either arm quit smoking at the 3-month follow-up.
Conclusions
On the basis of this formative work, PAQS living with HIV may be receptive to using a mobile health–based app intervention to help them decide whether, when, or how to stop using tobacco. Indices of acceptability and impact indicate that additional research and development are warranted.

abstract = {Autophagy is a critical conserved cellular process in maintaining cellular homeostasis by clearing and recycling damaged organelles and intracellular components in lysosomes and vacuoles. Autophagy plays a vital role in cell survival, bioenergetic homeostasis, organism development, and cell death regulation. Malfunctions in autophagy are associated with various human diseases and health disorders, such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Significant effort has been devoted to autophagy-related research in the context of genes, proteins, diagnosis, etc. In recent years, there has been a surge of studies utilizing state of the art machine learning (ML) tools to analyze and understand the roles of autophagy in various biological processes. We taxonomize ML techniques that are applicable in an autophagy context, comprehensively review existing efforts being taken in this direction, and outline principles to consider in a biomedical context. In recognition of recent groundbreaking advances in the deep-learning community, we discuss new opportunities in interdisciplinary collaborations and seek to engage autophagy and computer science researchers to promote autophagy research with joint efforts.}

Writers need to learn how to critically employ the tools’ affordances to maximise their learning and L2 instructors face the challenge of guiding students through these novel contexts (cf. Sasaki, 2023). Also collaborative writing (CW) interventions have to find ways how to include GenAI as another technology that impacts the effectiveness of CW as an instructional L2 writing tool (cf. Storch, 2022; Su et al., 2023). In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of how GenAI influences revision and deliberation processes during CW within four writing pairs (N = 8; aged 18–23) engaging in a classroom-based intervention that tasked them to compare their own writing with GenAI models. We analysed screen recordings of evolving revision behaviours, changes in text quality as well as joint discussions among pairs. Complementing Strobl, Menke-Bazhutkina, Abel, and Michel (2024), the current paper (i) relates writers’ revision behaviour to text quality evaluated for functional adequacy (Kuiken & Vedder, 2017); and (ii) presents a fine-grained review of dialogues to identify patterns of CW revisions in interaction with GenAI models. Findings shed new light on CW models (Storch, 2009) in the digital era where GenAI is implemented in L2 writing and revision instruction.}

Companies need to handle new technology while still responding to environmental, economic, and societal challenges. Thus work and work requirements on managers and workforces are changing. New skills are needed across industries, domains, and positions, resulting in increasing skill gaps among companies worldwide. These challenges are intensified by demographic realities in Europe, China, and the USA, where declining birth rates lead to shrinking and ageing populations. Political and industrial leaders are questioning how the skill gaps can be managed to retain competitiveness. The research community is searching for a deeper and more prescriptive understanding of skill gap management, but in previous literature, conclusive strategies seem so far to be scarce, diverse, and often lacking empirical foundation. This paper identifies practices that successfully bridge skill gaps in organisations and highlights challenges faced by companies. Empirical data was gathered through interviews with 23 leaders from companies globally and analysed qualitatively. The study concludes with a set of directions for organisations to develop skill gap strategies. The paper describes how empirical findings converge into the Skill Bridge, consisting of five priority areas, i.e. Skill development initiatives, Knowledge empowerment, Impact and business results, Leadership and culture, and finally Learning technologies and innovation.}

This is especially crucial in the second language (L2) classroom, where timely and targeted input is important for guiding progress. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT-4 have recently gained attention for their potential to enhance this process. This qualitative study examines the use of AI-generated feedback to support writing development among advanced Spanish learners, drawing on thematic analysis of questionnaire responses, writing revisions, and students' reflections. It also explores how AI can complement traditional instructor input by supporting targeted revisions, fostering metacognitive reflection, and enhancing learner agency through critical engagement with feedback. Participants completed pre- and post-treatment questionnaires and a formal writing task, receiving constructive input from both their instructor and ChatGPT-4 before revising their drafts. The AI tool delivered detailed, rubric-aligned feedback across five areas: argumentation, linguistic concepts, research and analysis, grammar and language, and structure and formality. Although students appreciated the efficiency and structure of AI-generated guidance, they consistently valued the personalized, context-sensitive feedback provided by their instructor. Findings highlight generative AI's potential to enhance early-stage drafting by offering immediate and concrete guidance. Still, students expressed skepticism about AI's role in language learning and voiced ethical concerns—including overreliance, uncertainty about how their personal data would be used, a lack of clear institutional policies, and risks related to plagiarism. These insights emphasize the importance of integrating AI literacy into educational practice to ensure these tools are employed critically, ethically, and effectively.}

This paper introduces a conceptual framework that bridges that gap by integrating established offender-based theories with a novel macro-level understanding of fraud as an emergent property of a complex adaptive system. It develops and restructures Fraud Field Theory to place opportunities—the points of interaction between threat and safeguard fields—at the centre of analysis. Drawing on complexity theory, systems thinking, and critical realism, the study explores how feedback, adaptation, and layered causal mechanisms connect individual actions with collective outcomes. The argument is conceptual rather than empirical: causal loop diagrams are used as heuristic devices to illustrate how interactions within and across systems may generate emergent patterns of fraud. The revised framework is then located within a critical realist ontology that distinguishes between empirical events, actual but unobserved processes, and the deeper generative mechanisms that condition them. This synthesis demonstrates how micro-level offender logics can be interpreted within broader organisational, technological, and societal contexts. If fraud stems from the adaptive dynamics of these interconnected systems rather than from isolated acts of wrongdoing, the efficacy of deterrence-focused policies will remain limited. A new policy frame is needed, one that treats fraud control as a process of continual system adjustment, strengthening resilience, mapping systems, and adapting interventions as the environment continually evolves.}

The weighted single-step approach for genome-wide association study was performed to estimate the SNP effects and variances accounted by 10–SNP sliding windows. Confirming the polygenic nature of the studied traits, 20, 22, 21, and 19 genomic windows that explained more than 0.5% of the additive genetic variance were identified for fecal egg counts (FEC), Famacha© (FAM), packed cell volume (PCV), and total plasma protein (TPP), respectively. A total of 81, 122, 106, and 101 protein-coding genes were found in windows associated with FEC, FAM, PCV, and TPP, respectively. Several protein‐coding genes related to the immune system and inflammatory response functions were identified within those genomic regions, such as ADCY9, ADRB2, BRAF, CADM1, CCL20, CD70, CREBBP, FNBP1, HTR4, IL16, IL22, IL26, MAPK8, NDFIP1, NLRC3, PAK5, PLCB1, PLCB4, ROCK1, TEK, TNFRSF12A, and VAV1.

Thus, two biostimulants, soil bioremediation nutrients (SBNs) and nutrient solution (NS), were tested to assess their effects on the degradation of PHCs and changes in bacterial community compositions, functions and functional genes using third generation sequencing, Tax4Fun2 and qPCR at the field scale. The addition of SBNs or NS significantly increased and accelerated the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The highest TPH degradation rate (96%) and k (0.134/day) were shown for biopiles with SBNs addition (particularly for 0.5% SBNs), indicating that SBNs were a good biostimulant for bioremediation of PHC-contaminated soil in the field. After different operations, rapid reconstruction of bacterial communities and functions for 5 biopiles was found with relatively high metabolic function and a change in dominant PHC degraders from Rugosibacter aromaticivorans and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans to Immundisolibacter cernigliae and Dyella ginsengisoli. The results of Tax4Fun2 prediction revealed that the addition of SBNs and water with soil turning enhanced and accelerated bacterial metabolic functions and related functional genes for degrading aromatic compounds. The qPCR results indicated that most samples contained a relatively high abundance of alkB, alkB1, XylE and PHE, and high expression of XylE and PHE, while the addition of SBNs and NS enhanced the expression of XylE and PHE for degrading catechol and phenol. Concentrations of TPH and nutrients were major environmental factors influencing the degradation of TPH, alkane and aromatic compounds and changes in bacterial communities, functions and functional genes (e.g., alkB, alkB1, XylE, NAH, PHE and BPH4). Biostimulation by the addition of SBNs proved an effective strategy for increasing the degradation of PHCs and facilitating the growth and metabolic activity of PHC degraders.}

abstract = {Background
The online offer of commercial genetic tests, also called direct-to-consumer genetic tests (DTC-GTs), enables citizens to gain insight into their health and disease risk based on their genetic profiles. DTC-GT offers often consist of a combination of services or aspects, including advertisements, information, DNA analysis, and medical or lifestyle advice. The risks and benefits of DTC-GT services have been debated and studied extensively, but instruments that assess DTC-GT services and aid policy are lacking. This leads to uncertainty among policy makers, law enforcers, and regulators on how to ensure and balance both public safety and autonomy and about the responsibilities these 3 parties have toward the public.
Objective
This study aimed to develop a framework that outlines aspects of DTC-GTs that lead to policy issues and to help provide policy guidance regarding DTC-GT services.
Methods
We performed 3 steps: (1) an integrative literature review to identify risks and benefits of DTC-GT services for consumers and society in Embase and Medline (January 2014-June 2022), (2) structuring benefits and risks in different steps of the consumer journey, and (3) development of a checklist for policy guidance.
Results
Potential risks and benefits of DTC-GT services were mapped from 134 papers and structured into 6 phases. In summary, these phases were called the consumer journey: (1) exposure, (2) pretest information, (3) DNA analysis, (4) data management, (5) posttest information, and (6) individual and societal impact. The checklist for evaluation of DTC-GT services consisted of 8 themes, covering 38 items that may raise policy issues in DTC-GT services. The themes included the following aspects: general service content, validity and quality assurance, potential data and privacy risks, scientific evidence and robustness, and quality of the provided information.
Conclusions
Both the consumer journey and the checklist break the DTC-GT offer down into key aspects that may impact and compromise individual and public health, safety, and autonomy. This framework helps policy makers, regulators, and law enforcers develop methods to interpret, assess, and act in the DTC-GT service market.}

However, in these studies, corpus cleaning is often described as an optional step in the process of corpus creation and is frequently presented as a tedious, unnecessary, and time-consuming task, with the majority of scholars calling for the creation of “quick and dirty” corpora. In this paper, we re-examine corpus creation, namely corpus cleaning and metadata construction, for discipline-specific writing. More specifically, our paper seeks to reframe corpus cleaning and metadata construction as meaningful and purposeful activities that increase learners’ awareness of disciplinary norms and conventions, particularly in a comparative context. We base our analysis on the reflections provided by learners from various disciplines who designed, compiled, cleaned, and analyzed corpora, along with the final papers they drafted for the courses they took in the Department of English at a teaching-focused research university in the Middle East. Corpus cleaning and metadata creation, as we hope to show, not only make visible the invisible writing conventions within disciplines, including the integration of evidence and raw data, but also position language learners as data engineers, promoting their critical awareness of the role and nature of (language) data in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs).}

Despite being available for over two decades, the acceptance of Smart Home Technology (SHT) remains slower than anticipated, with technophobia acting as a significant barrier. This study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to investigate how psychological and cultural factors influence SHT acceptance. A mediation analysis involving English (N = 284) and Spanish (N = 230) participants assessed whether technophobia, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness mediate the relationship between the frustration of psychological needs and behavioural intention. The findings suggest indirect effects through technophobia and usability factors, with Spanish participants reporting greater frustration yet a higher intention to adopt. These results underscore the need for culturally tailored interventions, such as localised education and improved usability, to enhance confidence and support broader SHT adoption.}

Lignocellulosic characterization of the substrates was also performed to determine the exact nutrient requirements for fungal inoculation. Comparative analysis with the control sample cultured on traditional wheat straw showed that the solid wastes of SEO not only allowed a satisfactory growth rate of Pleurotus ostreatus, but also resulted in fruiting bodies with satisfactory sensory characteristics, chemical composition, and functional properties such as antioxidant activity. For the first time, emphasis was placed on cytotoxic and genotoxic properties to obtain baseline data for risk assessment. The results show that the maximum shelf life of P. ostreatus that allows overall quality to be maintained is seven days, as there is a genotoxic risk if the mushrooms are stored longer. Although the biological efficiency was <50 %, the fruiting bodies produced showed excellent characteristics, with growth yield of 1114 g for soybean seed husk (SBN) substrate. The only limitation was the duration of storage, considering the leakage of electrolytes >23 % on the day 14 which leads to increased growth of psychrotrophic microorganisms (2.65–3.20 log CFU/g). Considering the resource-intensive SEO industry and the significant amounts of waste associated with it, incorporating waste streams from this industry and converting them into valuable food contributes toward the research-backed realistic new avenues and moves beyond the status quo of the SEO industry.}

The purpose of this article is to critically examine key DDL initiatives, some of which take a ‘research into practice’ orientation. Importantly, the discussion is framed around the notion of ‘specificity’ in the context of needs analysis, and whether the initiatives take a wide-angle, narrow-angle or move from a wide-angle to a narrow angle approach. Accounts which focus on DIY (do-it-yourself) mini-corpus compilation and use by students are also reviewed. The final section of the article presents a critique of current pedagogic applications, taking a closer look at the issue of ‘specificity’ within the wider context of needs analysis and mapping out areas for future consideration. It is suggested that an ethnographic perspective may be particularly useful for conceptualising specificity relating to students' present situation needs.

The exact identification of druggable sites, clarification of molecular interactions, and logical design of drugs and medicines have all been made possible by these structural discoveries. In addition to these experimental methods, CADD uses algorithms and computational tools to speed up drug discovery workflows. Researchers can anticipate ligand-binding affinities, optimize lead compounds, and evaluate their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles through molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations. Furthermore, CADD's predictive powers have been enhanced by developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have simplified the process of creating new medications with improved efficacy and fewer side effects. In this chapter, the applications of these fundamental computational techniques to support lead optimization, lead discovery, and target identification are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
This study demonstrates that digital maturity contributes to strengthened quality and safety performance outcomes in US hospitals. Advanced digital maturity is associated with more digitally enabled work environments with automated flow of data across information systems to enable clinicians and leaders to track quality and safety outcomes. This research illustrates that an advanced digitally enabled workforce is associated with strong safety leadership and culture and better patient health and safety outcomes.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the relationship between digital maturity and quality and safety outcomes in US hospitals.
Methods
The data sources were hospital safety letter grades as well as quality and safety scores on a continuous scale published by The Leapfrog Group. We used the digital maturity level (measured using the Electronic Medical Record Assessment Model [EMRAM]) of 1026 US hospitals. This was a cross-sectional, observational study. Logistic, linear, and Tweedie regression analyses were used to explore the relationships among The Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Grades, individual Leapfrog safety scores, and digital maturity levels classified as advanced or fully developed digital maturity (EMRAM levels 6 and 7) or underdeveloped maturity (EMRAM level 0). Digital maturity was a predictor while controlling for hospital characteristics including teaching status, urban or rural location, hospital size measured by number of beds, whether the hospital was a referral center, and type of hospital ownership as confounding variables. Hospitals were divided into the following 2 groups to compare safety and quality outcomes: hospitals that were digitally advanced and hospitals with underdeveloped digital maturity. Data from The Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Grades report published in spring 2019 were matched to the hospitals with completed EMRAM assessments in 2019. Hospital characteristics such as number of hospital beds were obtained from the CMS database.
Results
The results revealed that the odds of achieving a higher Leapfrog Group Hospital Safety Grade was statistically significantly higher, by 3.25 times, for hospitals with advanced digital maturity (EMRAM maturity of 6 or 7; odds ratio 3.25, 95% CI 2.33-4.55).
Conclusions
Hospitals with advanced digital maturity had statistically significantly reduced infection rates, reduced adverse events, and improved surgical safety outcomes. The study findings suggest a significant difference in quality and safety outcomes among hospitals with advanced digital maturity compared with hospitals with underdeveloped digital maturity.}

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to break down the widely presumed dichotomy, especially in law, between fully automated decisions and human decisions from a psychological and normative perspective. This is particularly relevant as human oversight is seen as an effective means of quality control, including in the current AI Act. The phenomenon of automation bias argues against this assumption. We have investigated this phenomenon of automation bias, as a behavioral effect of and its implications in normative institutional decision-making situations. The phenomenon of automation bias, whereby individuals overly rely on machine-generated decisions or proposals, has far-reaching implications. Excessive reliance may result in a failure to meaningfully engage with the decision at hand, resulting in an inability to detect automation failures, and an overall deterioration in decision quality, potentially up to a net-negative impact of the decision support system. As legal systems emphasize the role of human decisions in ensuring fairness and quality, this paper critically examines the inadequacies of current EU and national legal frameworks in addressing the risks of automation bias. Contributing a novel perspective, this article integrates psychological, technical, and normative elements to analyze automation bias and its legal implications. Anchoring human decisions within legal principles, it navigates the intersections between AI and human-machine interactions from a normative point of view. An exploration of the AI Act sheds light on potential avenues for improvement. In conclusion, our paper proposes four steps aimed at effectively countering the potential perils posed by automation bias. By linking psychological insights, legal analysis, and technical implications, this paper advocates a holistic approach to evolving legal frameworks in an increasingly automated world.}

abstract = {Plastic pipe reinforced by cross helically wound steel wires (PSP) is a new type of steel reinforced thermoplastic pipe, which is composed of steel wires and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). PSP exhibits time-dependent mechanical behavior when undertaking a long-period load due to its viscoelastic polymer matrix. Therefore, to ensure the long-term safety of PSP system, it is essential to study the long-term mechanical performance and propose a method to predict the long-term failure pressure of PSP. The work in this study is as follows. Firstly, groups of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests were conducted under different temperatures to get the creep compliance of the HDPE, owing to the interconversion method between frequency- and time-dependent material functions. Prominent nonlinear mechanical behavior of the steel wire was obtained through uniaxial tensile tests. Then long-term hydrostatic tests of PSP were carried out for validation of the following theoretical model. Secondly, a long-term theoretical analysis model of the PSP was proposed considering the elastoplastic property of the steel wire and the viscoelasticity of the HDPE. The return-mapping algorithm was integrated in the theoretical model to precisely describe the nonlinear mechanical performance of steel wire, and an iterative computation was employed to determine the viscoelastic response of the HDPE matrix in recursive forms. Afterwards, a long-term theoretical model of the PSP was established referring to equilibrium equations of a cylindrical shell subject to internal pressure, and a computational procedure was developed to implement the iterative computation process. Then, the variation of the long-term failure pressure of the PSP with time could be theoretically predicted, and the prediction results aligned well with the long-term hydrostatic test results, with small errors ranging from -3.96% to 6.35%. The causes of errors were analyzed. Furthermore, based on the model, it was studied that the influences of different factors on the mechanical performance of the PSP, including the steel-wire plastic behavior, steel wires’ number, steel wires’ radius, pipe thickness. This research might be helpful for composite structures containing reinforcements and matrix of nonlinear mechanical properties.}

In this regard three regioisomers of a n-(2-(naphthalen-2-yl)vinyl)oxazole molecule (nNVOx), differing in the oxazole substitution pattern (n = 2, 4, 5), are synthesized and methodically investigated by means of electronic UV–Vis spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods for spectral data analysis. Design of the experiments and interpretation of their output is additionally supported by quantum-chemical simulations based on the (TD) DFT methodology. As the result, all the studied nNVOx compounds are unveiled to simultaneously occur in form of at least two non-equivalent rotational isomers, varying in the conformation taken by the arene moieties with respect to the central vinyl fragment. The individual rotamers are then demonstrated to exhibit non-identical spectroscopic properties expressed by differences in corresponding absorption and fluorescence profiles, thereby ultimately confirming the impact of rotamerism onto the investigated molecular systems.}

abstract = {Quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) are invaluable computational tools for the prediction of the biological effects and physico-chemical properties of molecules. For chemical safety assessment they are used frequently to make predictions of toxic or adverse effects, as well as other activities related to toxicokinetics. QSARs and their predictions can be assessed against a number of criteria for their potential use as surrogates for animal, or other, tests. A recent exercise by the Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, Japan, assessed QSARs to predict the outcome of the Ames test. The predictive performance of models was scrutinised with full disclosure of results. The authors of this publication developed one such model, which had disappointing performance in this predictive exercise. In order to understand why the QSAR had poor performance metrics, this paper reflects on factors that affect a QSAR model. There is no one reason for poor performance of a QSAR model, rather it is likely to be a combination of factors. Reasons for poor performance included inadequate consideration of the underlying data quality, consistency and relevance; lack of appropriate descriptors relating to the endpoint and mechanism of action; not selecting a model correctly in terms of its structure (i.e., complexity) and number of descriptors; not addressing metabolism adequately in the modelling process; ill-defined assessment of the uncertainties within a model; and not ensuring predictions are within the applicability domain of the model. Whilst this paper draws on examples for the prediction of mutagenicity, the findings are applicable to all toxicological activities and physico-chemical properties.}

abstract = {Background
The provision of end-of-life care for children in intensive care is a stressful and traumatic event for parents with immediate and life-long impacts. End-of-life care for children is also challenging for critical care nurses who must balance the child’s clinical requirements concurrently with facilitating and supporting the needs of parents and family members.
Research question
What is the research evidence about nurses’ and parents’ experiences of the provision of end-of-life care in intensive care for children?
Review methods
Following registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, a systematic review was undertaken. A combination of keywords, synonyms, and Medical Subject Headings were used across Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) Complete, Medline, and APA PsycInfo databases. Papers were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included papers were assessed for quality. Narrative synthesis was used to analyse and present the findings.
Findings
From 40,904 records screened, 55 research publications were included, representing the perspectives of nurses, mothers, fathers, extended family, and legal guardians. Narrative synthesis revealed seven themes identified from the nurse and parent experiences: (i) communication; (ii) end-of-life decision-making; (iii) suffering; (iv) preparing for death; (v) at the end of life; (vi) after death; and (vii) nurse impacts. While there was mostly concordance between nurse and parent experiences, there was some discord between parents’ communication needs and nurses’ understanding of their role in communication. This review also highlighted how nurses commit to supporting parents in their grief and bereavement while concurrently managing their own emotions in response to a child’s death.
Conclusion
A child’s death cannot always be prevented. By exploring nurses’ and parents’ experiences of end-of-life care, as they occur simultaneously and in parallel, it is possible to build understanding and evolve practices to improve the experience of end-of-life care for children for all involved.}

The present study examined this critical issue through collecting reflective journals and interview data from 23 students enrolled in an EAP course at a Chinese university. Drawing on the Experiential Learning Theory, which delineates how learners adapt and build new knowledge and skills through concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, and active experimentation, this study found that students engaged with AI tools in a dynamic, iterative, and critical process when completing three course assignments. Through such engagement, they reflected on the effectiveness of specific tools and strategies and conceptualised AI’s utility in providing different types of assistance, culminating into the development of both specific and integrated, abstract metacognitive knowledge about when, where, why, and how to use AI in their learning. Such complex, interconnected knowledge was found to have further influenced their AI use through purposefully planning, exploring, monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting their AI strategies. The study also disclosed a generally negative perceived impact of AI use on language development, indicating the potentially detrimental effect of instrumental motivation for AI use. These findings highlight the need to reconceptualise metacognitive awareness as a synergistic system and the importance of fostering such awareness among students. Pedagogical implications are also drawn for teachers to design instructional activities that encourage students to actively reflect on their interactions with AI and regulate their AI strategies.}

Despite the extensive use of deep learning models in mammographic image classification, existing approaches often lack interpretability. They are prone to diagnostic errors due to image heterogeneity, noise, and the limited availability of annotated datasets. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel hybrid model that integrates handcrafted texture and geometric features—such as entropy, eccentricity, mean intensity, and GLCM descriptors—directly into a modified Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) architecture. The primary objective is to improve both diagnostic accuracy and transparency in mammogram classification. Experiments were conducted on the publicly available VinDr-Mammo dataset, which includes 2136 annotated DICOM images with BI-RADS labels. The hybrid model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 30% reduction in Total Loss, higher sensitivity (0.96), specificity (0.97), and ROC-AUC (0.96), compared to the baseline model without additional features. The integration of clinically interpretable descriptors enhances not only detection accuracy but also the explainability of the results, offering valuable insights for radiologists. These findings contribute to the development of AI-assisted diagnostic tools that are both robust and transparent, particularly in low-resource clinical environments.}

This study investigated the composition of forest understory vegetation in terms of number of species, abundance, and height and their response to livestock grazing intensities in a grazed Village Land Forest Reserve in Tanzania. A 12-month grazing experiment with five grazing cycles was conducted within four blocks of 4 ha each, with 0, 8, 12, and 18 adult cows/ha for control, low, moderate, and high grazing intensities, respectively. A total of 178 plant species belonging to 146 genera and 43 families were recorded. These were classified into nine growth forms; annual climber, annual forb, annual grass, perennial climber, perennial forb, perennial grass, sedge, shrub, and tree seedling, with dominant and co-dominant species found among the annual forbs and tree seedlings, respectively. Low and moderate intensity treatments showed no significant reduction in the number, abundance, and stem height of plant species, while the high intensity treatment showed a significant reduction in abundance and stem height, but not in number of species relative to the control. We conclude that, within the duration of the study, the grazing intensities applied did not affect the number of plant species, whereas both abundance and height were affected significantly. The study indicates that reducing grazing to low or moderate intensities with resting periods can enable the community to benefit from forage production without affecting the vegetation composition of the study forest.}

Calcified nodules (CN) have been associated with higher complexity and worse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in both stable and unstable coronary disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence on CN.
Methods
Systematic review of published studies on the prevalence, clinical associations, and impact of CN on outcomes after PCI up to November 2024.
Results
We identified 474 publications, of which 87 were included (all observational). CN were divided into 2 types: noneruptive CN (NECN), with an intact fibrous cap; and eruptive CN (ECN), with disruption of the fibrous cap with or without thrombus. The most common location was the right coronary artery (28%-71%). Angiography-based diagnostic sensitivity was low (18%-38%). Optical coherence tomography was preferred for type differentiation. The main clinical factors associated with CN were older age, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. CN were considered the culprit lesion in 3% to 18% of acute coronary syndromes but were also present in up to 30% of nonculprit arteries. ECN were associated with more events at follow-up than NECN (20% vs 3.3% at 1 year). Post-PCI, CN were associated with lower minimum lumen area (MLA), higher rates of stent-edge dissection (44%-73%), malapposition (71%-96%), and underexpansion (60%-77%). ECN were associated with better acute results but worse long-term outcomes compared with NECN.
Conclusions
CN are often present in acute coronary syndrome culprit and stable coronary lesions. Intracoronary imaging is essential for the diagnosis and differentiation of CN. CN are associated with worse outcomes after PCI, acutely and during follow-up.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Los nódulos de calcio (NC) se asocian con peores resultados tras intervencionismo coronario percutáneo (ICP). El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es resumir la evidencia actual sobre los NC.
Métodos
Revisión sistemática de estudios publicados sobre epidemiología, historia natural y resultados de ICP en NC, hasta noviembre de 2024.
Resultados
Se identificaron 474 publicaciones y se incluyeron 87 (todas observacionales). Se distinguen 2 tipos de NC: no eruptivos (NCNE), con capa fibrosa intacta, y eruptivos (NCE), con disrupción de la capa fibrosa con o sin trombo. La localización más frecuente es la coronaria derecha (28-71%). La sensibilidad diagnóstica de la angiografía es baja (18-38%). La tomografía de coherencia óptica es la técnica de elección para distinguir ambos subtipos. Los principales factores asociados son mayor edad, diabetes mellitus y enfermedad renal crónica. Los NC causan el 3-18% de los síndromes coronarios agudos, pero aparecen en el 30% de las arterias no culpables. Los NCE se asocian con más episodios durante el seguimiento que los NCNE (el 20 frente al 3,3% a 1 año). Tras el ICP, los NC se asocian con menos área luminal mínima y más disección del borde del stent (44-73%), mala posición (71-96%) e infraexpansión (60-77%). Los NCE presentan mejores resultados inmediatos, pero peores a largo plazo, que los NCNE.
Conclusiones
Los NC pueden ser lesiones culpables de síndromes coronarios agudos, pero son frecuentes en enfermedad estable. La imagen endovascular es clave para diagnosticarlos y definir el subtipo. Los NC se asocian con malos resultados tras ICP, tanto agudos como en el seguimiento.}

Rich and detailed data play a pivotal role in the optimal design of HRES. However, remote areas often face data limitations due to inadequate metering infrastructure, which further increases uncertainties in HRES design. This paper proposes a planning optimization method that quantifies multiple uncertainties, requiring only limited information for the optimal HRES design. First, uncertainties in HRES planning are classified into different types based on intrinsic randomness, data availability, and impact level. Then, by integrating uncertainty quantification with credibility theory, knowledge-based scenario generation models are developed to leverage limited available information to generate extreme and typical operating conditions for a tailored HRES design. Finally, a fuzzy credibility-constrained stochastic-robust optimization model is proposed to optimize the design of HRES. A practical case facing significant data scarcity and gaps is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed approach reduces the loss of load probability for HRES to 0.02 % and lowers the levelized cost of energy to $0.16/kWh—33 % lower than that of the deterministic method and 79 % lower than that of the traditional stochastic method.}

Today, the increasing focus on sustainability in all its pillars is initiating a critical process and revision about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A new scenario characterized by human-centricity, resilience and social sustainability, named Industry 5.0, is emerging. In this transition process, new and old enabling technologies are appearing, among them the Metaverse. Although its actual functions are not yet fully investigated, from different perspective this tool could adequately support the definition of Industry 5.0 by creating a symbiotic ecosystem between companies, workers and consumers. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to investigate, through a systematic literature review, the role of the Metaverse in the approach to sustainability in order to understand in which way this technology can be useful for the transition. The results may support policy makers, managers and practitioners in understanding the role of Metaverse in sustainability and in the new wave of Industrial Revolution.

abstract = {Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for modeling complex physical problems. However, they suffer from spectral bias making them oblivious to high-frequency modes, which are present in multiscale physical systems. Therefore, they tend to produce over-smoothed solutions, which is particularly problematic in modeling turbulence and for systems with intricate patterns and sharp gradients such as multi-phase flow systems. In this work, we introduce a new approach named high-frequency scaling (HFS) to mitigate spectral bias in convolutional-based neural operators. By integrating HFS with proper variants of UNet, we demonstrate a higher prediction accuracy by mitigating spectral bias in single and two-phase flow problems. Unlike Fourier-based techniques, HFS is directly applied to the latent space, thus eliminating the computational cost associated with the Fourier transform. Additionally, we investigate alternative spectral bias mitigation through a diffusion model conditioned on neural operators. While the diffusion model integrated with the standard neural operator may still suffer from significant errors, these errors are substantially reduced when the diffusion model is integrated with a HFS-enhanced neural operator.}

Its composition directly determines the electrochemical and mass transfer performance of the fuel cell. Current experimental and modeling methodologies still have shortcomings in the comprehensive optimization of CCL performance. Therefore, this work proposes a machine learning framework combining a data-driven surrogate model and multi-objective optimization to effectively evaluate the influence of CCL compositions on three novel performance indexes, including voltage (Vcell), average value of CCL oxygen concentration (CO2), and water saturation (CCLsat). Firstly, CCL agglomerate model is integrated with the multi-physics PEMFC model to achieve an accurate characterization of performance. Numerical simulations provide a reliable database for training the surrogate model based on back propagation neural network (BPNN). Subsequently, the surrogate model is integrated with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-II) to expedite the assessment of fitness value for optimizing three performance indexes. Finally, the optimal CCL composition scheme located on the Pareto frontier is prioritized through the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). The results show that the decision-optimal model demonstrates varying degrees of improvement compared to the base model, with a 6.17% improvement in Vcell, increases of 5.84% in CO2, and reductions of 3.77% in CCLsat at 1 A cm−2. Therefore, a novel integrated optimization framework considering multi-factors and multi-objectives proposed in this study is of great significance in seeking the optimal CCL composition parameters and ultimately enhancing the comprehensive performance of PEMFC to accelerate its commercial application.}

Study 1 reveals that human-generated (vs. AI-generated) summaries lead to a higher level of trust, which boosts booking intentions. Study 2 finds that with negative reviews, there's no significant difference in booking intentions between AI and human-generated summaries, suggesting trust isn't the sole mediator. Study 3 proposes that information processing effort is a potential mediator. The findings confirm that when review valence is negative, customers invest more cognitive effort when reading AI-generated compared to human-generated summaries. The results challenge the assumption that human-generated reviews are inherently more persuasive.

However, AIMD is limited by the high-cost density functional theory (DFT) solution process and is unable to reach the time scale of the entire dynamic simulation, resulting in time-consuming AIMD calculations and a considerable scarcity of AIMD-based conductor data. Here, we propose a sequence relational large model based on transformer (T-AIMD) to infer ion diffusion from mean square displacement sequence data and hybrid multi-source material descriptor. T-AIMD successfully learns the whole long-range atomic diffusion to predict the ionic conductivity (σ) of any ion in any crystal structure to find fast-ion conductors, thus reducing the cost of AIMD simulation by a factor of 100. Using T-AIMD, we built the largest database of mixed ion conductors, and the σ of representative solid electrolytes has been successfully validated in previous battery experiments. Further, the manufactured solid-state battery with the predicted promising electrolyte exhibits almost no obvious capacity decay after 50 cycles with a high initial specific capacity of 1270 mAh g−1, which is promising to help devices work in extreme environments while guaranteeing battery life. By speeding up the prediction time of AIMD, the proposed T-AIMD opens the door for scientists to explore the atomic and molecular behaviors of other molecules/materials on long time scales, and will ultimately benefit the exploration of other key scientific questions in the energy field.}

However, some changes in reported behaviors differed depending on the type of cheating (social cheating, AI-related cheating, etc.). Additional survey questions about high school students’ AI chatbot usage and the perceived allowability of such technology revealed mixed opinions on the acceptability of using AI for various academic-related tasks.

The main annual bloom occurred in February-March when the abundance in the upper mixed layer could reach 5 × 106 cells m−3. Bloom was most intense in the centre of the sea and on the outer shelf waters. In April, the bloom subsided, and in summer, only small peaks could be found in the deep-sea waters. On the contrary, high cell abundance was observed in the shelf areas in summer and autumn. Three periods with different levels of biomass were distinguished in the centre of the deep-water basin: highest (February-March), moderate (April-June), and lowest (July-December). Nutrient levels varied during these three periods, contributing to different growth-promoting phases. Six experiments with natural phytoplankton conducted in April-June showed that dissolved nitrate (N) and phosphate (P) were growth-limiting factors for PDG. Very low dissolved silicate (DSi) in October likely limited growth, as evidenced by the algae's lack of response to N and P additions. In February-March, dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations were highest, with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), P, and DSi above 2.0 µM, 0.2 µM, and 2.5 µM, respectively. During the moderate growth period, DIN (˂ 1.2 µM) and P (˂ 0.15 µM) were expected to significantly limit the growth of PDG, while DSi was too high (> 3.5 µM) to have such an effect. In the second half of the year, DSi fell below 2.0 µM, which could severely inhibit cell growth in addition to DIN and P. Thus, after June, low DIN, P, and DSi combined resulted in the lowest PDG biomass.}

The overall 5-year survival rate remains low, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapies. Despite the promising efficacy of immunotherapy for various solid tumors, its benefits for pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. This is largely because of the complex and unique mechanisms of immune evasion inherent in PDAC. Emerging evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating the immune escape of PDAC. TAMs significantly contribute to forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which hinders the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches. They achieve this through multiple pathways, including the secretion of cytokines and the promotion or inhibition of multiple immune cells. In this review, we summarized the main pathways through which TAMs form an immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC. We also examined the current status and recent progress of immunotherapy strategies that specifically target macrophages. By understanding these mechanisms and exploring targeted therapies, we aimed to shed light on potential avenues for improving the treatment outcomes of this devastating disease.}

To achieve this, policymakers can use monetary incentives, such as higher charging price premiums, or non-monetary social incentives, such as fostering better neighborhood relationships, improving members’ sense of community belonging, or intensifying their social connections. However, the substitution effects between these incentives remain unclear. To address this, the research integrated a discrete choice experiment and an agent-based simulation model, to simulate home charger owners’ sharing adoption behavior. We found that a 15 % increase in the number of random links among home charger owners can replace a 10 % rise in the charging price premium. Adding an average 4 ties per agent or doubling the sense of community belonging yields equivalent effects. These findings imply that social incentives can cost-effectively substitute for monetary incentives in promoting home charger owners’ sharing adoption.}

For this reason, reverse pharmacology is now a tool for drug discovery from synthetic and natural products. Drug repositioning is the new use for an old approved drug, that may be marketed for the treatment of certain diseases. Drug repositioning can be a tool for drug discovery that can save time and money if it is based on reliable clinical observations which are then combined with the computational tools in order to obtain the required results at an appropriate time.

To address these issues, in this study, mathematical programming models are developed based on two approaches to assign orders to pickers and determine pickers’ routes in a North American consumer goods warehouse. Both approaches maximize the number of picked orders. However, in the simultaneous modelling approach, decisions are made in one model, while in the sequential modelling approach, first routing decisions then order assignment decisions are made. The sequential modelling approach compared with the simultaneous one yields better results in a shorter time. For the considered warehouse, the results suggest that the warehouse may not be able to handle more than 700 orders per shift without expanding its workforce. Furthermore, adding one picker increases the number of picked orders by 2%. Additionally, balancing pickers' workload is more effective when there are fewer than 600 orders available for picking per shift, because with a higher number of orders, pickers remain busy throughout the entire shift. The proposed mathematical modelling approaches enable warehouse managers and staff to process more orders with available resources (equipment, time, staff) and make better decisions using available data.}

Real-time monitoring captures information about suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) as they occur and offers great promise to learn about STBs. However, this approach also introduces questions about how to monitor and respond to real-time information about STBs. Given the increasing use of real-time monitoring, there is a need for novel, effective, and scalable tools for responding to suicide risk in real time.
Objective
The goal of this study was to develop and test an automated tool (ResourceBot) that promotes the use of crisis services (eg, 988) in real time through a rule-based (ie, if-then) brief barrier reduction intervention.
Methods
ResourceBot was tested in a 2-week real-time monitoring study of 74 adults with recent suicidal thoughts.
Results
ResourceBot was deployed 221 times to 36 participants. There was high engagement with ResourceBot (ie, 87% of the time ResourceBot was deployed, a participant opened the tool and submitted a response to it), but zero participants reported using crisis services after engaging with ResourceBot. The most reported reasons for not using crisis services were beliefs that the resources would not help, wanting to handle things on one’s own, and the resources requiring too much time or effort. At the end of the study, participants rated ResourceBot with good usability (mean of 75.6 out of 100) and satisfaction (mean of 20.8 out of 32).
Conclusions
This study highlights both the possibilities and challenges of developing effective real-time interventions for suicide risk and areas for refinement in future work.}

The research focuses on the Viennese hotel sector. Through qualitative content analysis and inductive category formation, the study finds that many SMEs reluctantly accept the dominance of online travel agencies (OTAs) due to established dependencies. As predicted by the resource dependence approach most SMEs search for ways to reduce these dependencies but tend to be unsure about effective responses. As cooperatives have been used in the past as an instrument to reduce dependencies, their suitability as a means for hotels to collectively build a countermeasure against OTAs was investigated in a subsequent step. The findings indicate that platform cooperatives are not considered a suitable response due to a lack of pioneers and uncertain success prospects. However, cooperative solutions that strengthen individual SMEs without directly challenging OTAs are viewed more favourably. Thus, platform cooperatives are not seen as most appropriate, but rather classical non-digital cooperatives supporting SMEs in a way that strengthen their individual position vis-à-vis online platforms.}

However, their potential use as research tools has been overshadowed by fears of how this technology can be misused. Some have argued that AI threatens scholarship, suggesting they should not replace human collaborators. Others have argued that AI creates opportunities, suggesting that AI-human collaborations could speed up research.

We argue that DL tools can be used to create realistic experiments and make specific types of quantitative studies feasible or safer with synthetic rather than real data.

Through a dedicated citizen science survey submitted to the Italian diving centers, we collected 115 presence records of the two seahorses occurring along the Italian coasts: Hippocampus hippocampus and H. guttulatus. From this dataset, we used 85 seahorse valitaded records to identify the ecological features of these two poorly known species and quantify the effects of human activities on their habitat suitability through geographic information systems and species distribution modelling. Our results indicated a continuous suitable area for both seahorses along the Italian coasts, with a single major gap in the central Adriatic Sea (Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions). They co-occurred in most of their Italian range, particularly in the central and southern Tyrrhenian coasts, and their ecological niches resulted to be significantly similar, although not equivalent. The least-cost paths of both species were concentrated in southern Italy (Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily), suggesting that more data is needed to improve the spatial resolution of the available information, especially in the northern and central Italy. Human activities influenced 38% and 42% of the habitat suitability of H. hippocampus and H. guttulatus, respectively, while only 25% and 30% of their potential distributions, respectively, are protected by Italy's existing conservation area system, in accordance with the global average for seahorses. In particular, the central Adriatic Sea represents a critical area where the occurrence of these seahorses is lower and the anthropic impact is higher. Considering all the Italian regions, fishing effort is the main human activity impacting both species. These findings will support the implementation of more efficient conservation actions. We encourage the application and interaction of citizen science and spatial ecology analyses to facilitate the assessment and sustainable management of elusive organisms.}

This includes looking back at speculative fiction narratives of artificial intelligence (AI), comparing embodied AI to virtual AI, and the history of chatbots and NPCs, which are intertwined regarding the future of virtually intelligent characters, now becoming known as SmartNPCs or generative agents. The current landscape of intelligent characters is explored, as well as several architectures that distinguish a full virtual character with an identity, virtual body, and a virtual landscape to explore from simple LLMs like ChatGPT. Several recent developments, including societies of SmartNPCs or generative agents, are explored. Looking toward the future, the chapter examines how virtual intelligent characters may lead the vanguard toward AGI because of their ability, unlike disembodied AI, to have experiences and build memories, both with human-based avatars and other AI characters in the virtual environments. The role of these characters in navigating the digital landscape in general and the Metaverse in particular, as well as the fears that AGI may lead to superintelligence, including the speculative fiction tropes that led to such worries, wrap up the chapter.}

abstract = {Background
Work-related stress is associated with poor job performance and negative health outcomes. Changing health behaviors through corporate wellness programs can improve physical and mental health and help employees manage stress. This project sought to pilot the potential addition of brief coaching and biofeedback to an 8-week web-based self-help program to improve employee stress using the multiphase optimization strategy.
Objective
This study aims to determine which candidate components will be tested in a later optimization phase and at what dose they will be tested, examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the different components, investigate whether the outcomes can be feasibly measured, and review evidence to build a conceptual model before the optimization phase.
Methods
The study was positioned within the preparation phase of the multiphase optimization strategy. It is a 2×2×2×2 design with 4 components: 2 types of health coaching and 2 types of biofeedback. All components were tested by turning them on or off. A total of 16 adult office workers (mean age 40, SD 14.3 years; n=15 women) completed an 8-week self-paced web-based stress management and health behavior change program and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 16 conditions, created from a combination of the 4 candidate components. Assessments included web analytics, surveys, and interviews regarding program recommendations, likes, and dislikes.
Results
Findings from the interviews provided suggestions to improve the intervention (eg, separating wellness from stress content) and trial conduct (eg, streamlining the onboarding process). On average, participants logged into the wellness program 83 times (range 36-291), with 75% (12/16) participant retention and 67% (8/12) survey completion. There were no reported problems with coaching or obtaining data from interviews or apps. The interview findings suggested potential mediators to include and assess in a future conceptual model.
Conclusions
The results provided areas to improve the intervention content and trial methods. Instead of progressing to the next scheduled large-scale optimization phase, our plan to iterate through a second preparation phase after making changes to the protocol, apps, and corporate coaching partner.}

This study proposes five components of corpus literacy skills (CL) based on a survey of previous studies to investigate in-service teachers' perceived CL skills. Subsequently, the relationships among these components will be explored. In addition, this study investigates whether age and teaching experience have an effect on perceived CL skills. Finally, this study reports on the in-service teacher’s point of view of having CL skills, as well as their limitations. A total of 105 female teachers self-reported their proficiency levels in CL skills as moderate to satisfactory. They were more confident in the fifth component, which was creating teaching materials using corpora output. We hypothesised that teachers' CL skills were linked to age and experience, in which the fifth component correlated negatively with teachers’ ages and teaching experiences. In addition, this study sheds light on the importance of the search component of CL skills, as it is a fundamental skill that influences the acquisition of other skills.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly embedded in medical education, providing benefits in instructional design, content creation, and administrative efficiency. Tools like ChatGPT are reshaping training and teaching practices in digital health. However, concerns about faculty overreliance highlight risks to pedagogical autonomy, cognitive engagement, and ethics. Despite global interest, there is limited empirical research on AI dependency among medical educators, particularly in underrepresented regions like the Global South.
Objective
This study focused on Palestine and aimed to (1) identify factors contributing to AI dependency among medical educators, (2) assess its impact on teaching autonomy, decision-making, and professional identity, and (3) propose strategies for sustainable and responsible AI integration in digital medical education.
Methods
A qualitative research design was used, using semistructured interviews (n=22) and focus group discussions (n=24) involving 46 medical educators from nursing, pharmacy, medicine, optometry, and dental sciences. Thematic analysis, supported by NVivo (QSR International), was conducted on 15.5 hours of transcribed data. Participants varied in their frequency of AI use: 45.7% (21/46) used AI daily, 30.4% (14/46) weekly, and 15.2% (7/46) monthly.
Results
In total, 5 major themes were identified as drivers of AI dependency: institutional workload (reported by >80% [37/46] of participants), low academic confidence (noted by 28/46, 60%), and perfectionism-related stress (23/46, 50%). The following 6 broad consequences of AI overreliance were identified: Skills Atrophy (reported by 89% [41/46]): educators reported reduced critical thinking, scientific writing, and decision-making abilities. Pedagogical erosion (35/46, 76%): decreased student interaction and reduced teaching innovation. Motivational decline (31/46, 67%): increased procrastination and reduced intrinsic motivation. Ethical risks (24/46, 52%): concerns about plagiarism and overuse of AI-generated content. Social fragmentation (22/46, 48%): diminished peer collaboration and mentorship. Creativity suppression (20/46, 43%): reliance on AI for content generation diluted instructional originality. Strategies reported by participants to address these issues included establishing boundaries for AI use (n=41), fostering hybrid intelligence (n=37), and integrating AI literacy into teaching practices (n=39).
Conclusions
While AI tools can enhance digital health instruction, unchecked reliance risks eroding essential clinician competencies. This study identifies cognitive, pedagogical, and ethical consequences of AI overuse in medical education and highlights the need for AI literacy, professional development, and ethical frameworks to ensure responsible and balanced integration.}

However, brain age reports from clinical MRIs are scant despite the rich clinical information hospitals provide. Since clinical MRI protocols are meant for specific clinical purposes, performance of brain age predictions on clinical data need to be tested. We explored the feasibility of using DeepBrainNet, a deep network previously trained on research-oriented MRIs, to predict the brain ages of 840 patients who visited 15 facilities of a health system in Florida. Anticipating a strong prediction bias in our clinical sample, we characterized it to propose a covariate model in group-level regressions of brain-PAD (recommended to avoid Type I, II errors), and tested its generalizability, a requirement for meaningful brain age predictions in new single clinical cases. The best bias-related covariate model was scanner-independent and linear in age, while the best method to estimate bias-free brain ages was the inverse of a scanner-independent and quadratic in brain age function. We demonstrated the feasibility to detect sex-related differences in brain-PAD using group-level regression accounting for the selected covariate model. These differences were preserved after bias correction. The Mean-Average Error (MAE) of the predictions in independent data was ∼8 years, 2–3 years greater than reports for research-oriented MRIs using DeepBrainNet, whereas an R2 (assuming no bias) was 0.33 and 0.76 for the uncorrected and corrected brain ages, respectively. DeepBrainNet on clinical populations seems feasible, but more accurate algorithms or transfer-learning retraining is needed.}

This paper examines the conjoint effects of serious psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse among transgender adults. The principal aims are to determine the prevalence of this “triple whammy,” identify the factors underlying the co-occurrence of all three problems, and to determine if there is evidence of syndemic effects underlying the “triple whammy.”
Methods
Data from the 2015 U.S. National Transgender Survey were used to examine the “triple whammy” relationship in a sample of 27,715 transgender Americans aged 18 or older. Odds ratios and multivariate logistic regression were performed to examine the data.
Results
13.3 % of the study participants reported experiencing serious psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. The most potent predictors of the “triple whammy” were younger age, a greater number of anti-transgender experiences, and not reaching various transition milestones. Strong evidence emerged to indicate the presence of syndemic effects in operation.
Conclusions
Experiencing the combination of adverse mental health and substance abuse was not uncommon in this population of transgender adults. Being young, experiencing a larger variety of types of anti-transgender discrimination, harassment, and violence, and not reaching specific transition milestones all had a significant impact on the odds that people would experience the “triple whammy.” This was particularly true when these measures were examined in conjunction with one another, because of strong syndemic effects.}

This study examines the Excel skills learning of first-generation college students (FGCS) and their peers by focusing on FGCS motivation and perceived learning in a campus-wide Excel Skills Training Workshop at a four-year, minority-serving public university in the United States. Our regression analysis of 88 paired survey responses shows that FGCS were less likely than their peers to perceive a successful learning outcome, but individual motivation had a significantly positive effect on students’ perception of their Excel skills learning. Our supplemental analysis of 24 teams in the post-workshop case analysis competition reveals that students’ self-perception is inconsistent with their actual performance in some Excel skills, and students performed better in tasks that require technical skills than those requiring soft skills. Our study provides practical implications for designing scalable, effective analytics skills training programs in accounting and business education.}

The experimental efforts aimed at the induction of SMs are greatly facilitated by computational techniques. The aim of this overview is to highlight the relevance of computational methods for the investigation of SM induction via microbial co-cultivation. The concepts related to the induction of SMs in microbial co-cultures are briefly introduced by addressing four areas associated with the SM induction workflows, namely the detection of SMs formed exclusively under co-culture conditions, the annotation of induced SMs, the identification of SM producer strains, and the optimization of fermentation conditions. The computational infrastructure associated with these areas, including the tools of multivariate data analysis, molecular networking, genome mining and mathematical optimization, is discussed in relation to the experimental results described in recent literature. The perspective on the future developments in the field, mainly in relation to the microbiome-related research, is also provided.}

This research addresses this gap through three empirical studies. An analysis of real-world TikTok data reveals that ads featuring AI-generated voice elicit lower levels of consumer engagement compared to those utilizing human voices. Notably, the negative impact of AI-generated voice is mitigated when a lower pitch is employed. In an experimental setting, we further compare the impact of human voice, AI-generated voice, and AI-generated celebrity voice on consumer engagement. The results indicate that AI-generated celebrity voice yield engagement levels comparable to those of human voices.

In this study, we employed an experimental design with 225 university students who completed a creative writing task with pre- and post-task surveys to assess ChatGPT's impact on their performance and experiences compared to a control group who did not use ChatGPT. Results show that using ChatGPT enhanced creativity of output and reduced the difficulty and effort required for the task, particularly for non-native English speakers. However, it also diminished the value and enjoyment of the task and raised moral concerns. We contribute to the nascent literature on GenAI by showing how ChatGPT assistance could potentially bolster human creativity by facilitating content delivery or providing useful counterpoint ideas. We also significantly advance scholarship on understanding experience of GenAI, demonstrating that bypassing the cognitive effort required for creativity by using ChatGPT could be harmful to the creative process and experience of creative tasks, especially when steps are not taken to address the use of AI in a transparent manner. Finally, our novel mixed-method study design offers a contribution to the methodological frameworks for the study of the effects and experience of GenAI. We discuss the study results in relation to implications for educational practices and social policy and argue that our results support recommending an integration of generative AI into higher education alongside practices that help to mitigate the negative impacts of AI use on student experience.}

Importantly, the presence of vitamin receptors in tumor cells suggests that vitamins play a significant role in the molecular and biochemical interactions in cancers. Additionally, studies on the efficacy of vitamin supplementation and dosage levels on tumor progression and mortality risk have yielded inconsistent results. Notably, molecular and biochemical investigations have reported the function of vitamins in the proliferation, growth, and invasiveness of tumor cells, as well as in cell cycle arrest and inflammatory signaling. Additionally, different vitamins may regulate the cancer microenvironment by activating various molecular pathways. Vitamins significantly affect immunological function, antioxidant defense, inflammation, and epigenetic control, and can improve treatment outcomes by affecting cell behavior and combating stress and DNA damage. However, further research is necessary to confirm the efficacy of vitamins, establish ideal dosages, and develop effective cancer prevention and treatment plans. Individualized supplementation plans guided by medical knowledge are crucial to achieving optimal results in clinical and preclinical settings. In this review, we critically evaluated the effects of different vitamins on the risk and development of cancer. Additionally, we examined the potential of vitamin supplements to enhance the efficacy of drug therapy and counteract resistance mechanisms that often arise during cancer treatment.}

The student-created video activity could be an effective pedagogical approach for contemporary higher education teaching in the artificial intelligence (AI) Era. However, its full potential has yet to be realized, and more research is needed to explore learning methodologies that can enhance its effectiveness. Mind mapping (MM) and real-time commenting (RTC) are two strategies that have been shown to enhance student engagement. This study investigated the effects of MM (with vs. without) and RTC (with vs. without) on students’ need satisfaction, engagement, creativity, and collaboration, using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to explain how the two strategies influence engagement and learning outcomes in video creation activities. We conducted an eight-week intervention study with 138 Chinese university students, using a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design, with four experimental groups: video creation (VC), video creation with MM (VC-MM), video creation with RTC (VC-RTC), and video creation with both MM and RTC (VC-MMRTC). Our analysis revealed that: (i) MM significantly satisfied students’ needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, while RTC significantly fulfilled their need for relatedness; (ii) MM significantly improved students’ behavioral, cognitive, and agentic engagement, while RTC significantly enhanced their emotional engagement; (iii) MM significantly improved students’ collaboration; and (iv) neither the MM nor RTC significantly improved students’ creativity. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating MM and RTC strategies in satisfying students’ three psychological needs, enhancing four types of student engagement, and improving collaboration in video-based learning activities. With the help of generative AI tools, instructors and students can easily adopt these strategies for effective learning.}

abstract = {The rat posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) is sexually dimorphic, has a high concentration of receptors for gonadal hormones and prolactin (PRL), and modulates reproduction. To unravel genetic and functional data for this relevant node of the social behavior network, we studied the expression of ERα, ERβ, GPER1, Kiss1, Kiss1R, PRGR, PRL, PRLR, EGR1, JAK2, STAT5A, and STAT5B in the MePD of males and females along the estrous cycle using the RT-qPCR technique. We also investigated whether PRL in the MePD would affect the sexual behavior display of proestrus females by microinjecting saline, the PRL receptor antagonist Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (1 µM and 10 µM), or PRL (1 nM) and Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (10 µM) 3 h before the onset of the dark-cycle period. The estrogen-dependent lordosis behavior, indicative of sexual receptivity of proestrus females, was recorded and compared before (control) and after (test) microinjections in these groups. Sex differences were found in the right and left MePD gene expression. ERα and Kiss1R, as well as PRL, Short PRLR, and STAT5B expression is higher in cycling females than males. Kiss1 expression is higher in males than females, and GPER1 is higher during diestrus than proestrus. Furthermore, Del1-9-G129R-hPRL in the MePD significantly reduced the full display and quotient of lordosis in proestrus females, an effect restored by the co-microinjection of PRL. In conjunction, the expression of studied genes showed specific sex and estrous cycle phase features, and PRL action in the MePD plays an essential role in the display of lordosis during the ovulatory period.}

abstract = {The exponential increase in the annual volume of publications places a significant challenge in assessing the disruptive potential of technologies in new papers. Prior approaches to identifying disruptive technologies based on the accumulation of paper citations are characterized by their limited prospective and time-consuming nature. Moreover, the total citation count fails to capture the intricate network of citations associated with the focal papers. Consequently, we advocate for the utilization of the disruption index instead of depending on citation counts. Particularly, we devise a novel neural network, called Soft Prompt-aware Shared BERT (SPS-BERT), to predict the potential technological disruption index of immediately published papers. It incorporates separate soft prompts to enable BERT examining comparative details within a paper's abstract and its references. Additionally, a tailored attention mechanism is employed to intensify the semantic comparison. Based on the enhanced representation derived from BERT, we utilize a linear layer to estimate potential disruption index. Experimental results demonstrate that SPS-BERT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predicting five-year disruption index across the DBLP and PubMed datasets. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of our model to predict the ten-year disruption index and five-year citation increments, demonstrating its robustness and scalability. Notably, our model's predictions of disruptive technologies, based on papers published in 2022, align with the expert assessments released by MIT, highlighting its practical significance.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. In this article, we explore the potential applications of LLMs in enhancing cardiovascular care and research. We discuss how LLMs can be used to simplify complex medical information, improve patient-physician communication, and automate tasks such as summarising medical articles and extracting key information. In addition, we highlight the role of LLMs in categorising and analysing unstructured data, such as medical notes and test results, which could revolutionise data handling and interpretation in cardiovascular research. However, we also emphasise the limitations and challenges associated with LLMs, including potential biases, reasoning opacity, and the need for rigourous validation in medical contexts. This review provides a practical guide for cardiovascular professionals to understand and harness the power of LLMs while navigating their limitations. We conclude by discussing the future directions and implications of LLMs in transforming cardiovascular care and research.
Résumé
Les modèles de langage à grande échelle (LLM, de l'anglais 'large language models') sont devenus des outils puissants en intelligence artificielle, démontrant des capacités remarquables dans le traitement et la génération du langage naturel. Dans cet article, nous explorons les applications potentielles des LLM pour améliorer les soins et la recherche cardiovasculaires. Nous discutons de la manière dont les LLM peuvent être utilisés pour simplifier des informations médicales complexes, améliorer la communication patient-médecin et automatiser des tâches telles que la synthèse d’articles médicaux et l’extraction d’informations clés. De plus, nous soulignons le rôle des LLM dans la catégorisation et l’analyse des données non structurées, telles que les notes médicales et les résultats des tests, ce qui pourrait révolutionner la gestion et l’interprétation des données dans la recherche cardiovasculaire. Cependant, nous soulignons également les limites et les défis associés aux LLM, notamment les biais potentiels, l’opacité de leur raisonnement et la nécessité d’une validation rigoureuse dans les contextes médicaux. Cette revue fournit un guide pratique aux professionnels cardiovasculaires pour comprendre et exploiter la puissance des LLM tout en naviguant dans leurs limites. Nous concluons en discutant des orientations futures et des implications des LLM dans la transformation des soins et de la recherche cardiovasculaires.}

abstract = {Photocorrosion remains a key limitation for long-term operation of oxide-based photocatalysts. In this study, potassium trivanadate (KV₃O₈) microplatelets were synthesised via a low-temperature Liquid-Phase Exfoliation with Ion Exchange (LPE-IonEx) method and subsequently modified through two surface engineering strategies: nanodiamond decoration (KVO–NDs) and defect engineering to generate a high density of surface oxygen vacancies (KVO–SDE). Nanodiamond decoration introduced negatively charged functional groups and partial surface coverage, improving colloidal stability and moderating charge transfer. In contrast, oxygen vacancy engineering created uniformly defect-enriched surfaces with enhanced oxygen adsorption capability. Both modifications altered the methylene blue degradation pathway from a hole/•OH-driven mechanism, prone to self-oxidation, to a superoxide/singlet oxygen-dominated route, which limits direct oxidative attack on the catalyst surface. As a result, surface-engineered samples exhibited higher resistance to morphological degradation, vanadium leaching, and loss of surface V⁴⁺ content during repeated photocatalytic cycles. Between the two approaches, KVO–SDE provided the most uniform and durable protection, while KVO–NDs offered partial but still significant suppression of photocorrosion. These findings demonstrate that tuning surface chemistry and charge can simultaneously enhance photocatalytic efficiency and durability, providing a viable route for developing stable photocatalysts for environmental applications.}

abstract = {Ridesharing plays a potential role in supporting transportation systems. However, the impact of service cues on individuals’ perceptions of transportation system resilience has yet to be fully examined. Building on cue utilization theory, this study adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the influence of congestion relief services provided by ridesharing platforms on individuals’ perceived resilience and trust in the road transportation system and the impact of passengers’ time urgency in this context. In Phase 1, semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify the cues derived from ridesharing platforms and those utilized by ridesharing users during the processes of calling and waiting for a ride. Subsequently, a research model and hypotheses were proposed. In Phase 2, path analysis was performed to validate the model. Results revealed that the intrinsic and extrinsic cues during the calling and waiting processes enhance individuals’ perceived diagnosticity, further promoting their trust and perceived resilience in the road transportation system. Moreover, as individuals’ trust in the road transportation system increases, their perceived resilience increases. Additionally, passengers’ time urgency negatively moderates the positive relationship between usage flexibility and perceived diagnosticity. Overall, this study enriches existing literature and provides practical implications for traffic management departments in mitigating uncertainty in the road transportation system.}
