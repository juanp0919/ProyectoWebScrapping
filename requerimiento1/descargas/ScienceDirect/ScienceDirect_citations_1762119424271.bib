abstract = {Much has been exhorted to pursue participatory building design (PBD) but little has been done to enhance it owing to difficulties such as participant inclusion and clarity of expression. An opportunity is enabled by metaverse and generative AI technologies. This paper aims to explore this by developing a framework that integrates metaverse and generative AI. To start, a desktop study is conducted to examine the challenges related to PBD. Based on this, a PBD framework called Meta-interaction was developed. It incorporates metaverse in enabling users to participate in the immersive design process, and generative AI for automated user requirement extraction, design feature option generation, and visualization. Finally, the prototype was implemented in five pilot cases. Results show that the framework is applicable and highly valued by most designers and end-users. This study enriches the applications of metaverse and generative AI in building design and offers insights for future PBD initiatives.}

abstract = {Hydrogen produced from renewable energy is being promoted to decarbonise global energy systems. To support this energy transition, standards, certification, and labelling schemes (SCLs) aim to differentiate hydrogen products based on their system-wide carbon emissions and method of production characteristics. However, being certified as low-carbon, clean, or green hydrogen does not guarantee broader sustainability across economic, environmental, social, or governance dimensions. Through an international survey of energy-sector and sustainability professionals (n = 179), we investigated the desirable sustainability features for renewable hydrogen SCLs and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sustainability certification. Our mixed-method study revealed general accordance on the feasible inclusion of diverse sustainability criteria in SCLs, albeit with varying degrees of perceived essentiality. Within the confines of the data, some differences in viewpoints emerged based on respondents’ geographical and supply chain locations, which were associated with the sharing of costs and benefits. Qualitatively, respondents found the idea of SCL harmonisation attractive but weighed this against the risks of duplication, complicated administrative procedures, and contradictory regulation. The implications of this research centre on the need for further studies to inform policy recommendations for an overarching SCL sustainability framework that embodies the principles of harmonisation in the context of multistakeholder governance.}

In addition, we surveyed 978 followers of AI influencers, employing structural equation modeling (SEM) to delineate the affordances of AI influencers. The thematic analysis extracted four key AI affordances, namely modality, autonomy, guidance, and interactivity, that positively shape AI influencers’ perceived humanness and trust, which in-turn drives purchase intention and active engagement. These findings offer multi-method evidence on how the strategic use of AI affordances shapes consumer perceptions and behaviors in human-AI interactions.}

abstract = {Large-scale bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could be realized without escalating biomass use - under the right conditions. We apply robust decision-making theory to frame carbon capture as a decision problem. We then search for conditions of low costs and energy penalties by modelling the capture decision across a million scenarios of already-existing plants in Sweden. Mining the scenario data reveals that annual plant utilization, heat recovery via heat pumps and electricity prices constitute key conditions for combined heat and power plants. For pulp mills, key conditions are site-specific, but the availability of low-pressure steam and electricity prices are generally important. A sensitivity analysis supports these findings, but also identifies capture rates as key. About 19 MtCO2 could be captured annually from the 113 plants studied while combusting zero additional biomass. Under the identified conditions, this would entail reduced power and district heating generation of 5.1-7.9 TWh per year – a modest penalty relative to the 220 TWh generated annually in Sweden.}

Drawing on data from Chinese listed companies spanning 2010 to 2022, empirical findings demonstrate that enterprise digital technology (DT) effectively reduces energy consumption intensity (ECI). Moreover, climate policy uncertainty (CPU) acts as a catalyst, amplifying the energy-saving impact of DT while further advancing its application within enterprises. Mechanism analysis reveals that DT contributes to energy conservation by improving total factor productivity and innovation efficiency, expanding enterprise scale, promoting digital transformation, and reducing costs. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the energy-saving effect of DT is particularly pronounced in areas characterized by high levels of energy uncertainty, manufacturing sectors, and big data experimentation domains. This paper provides novel micro-level evidence for comprehensively understanding the interplay among CPU, adoption of DT, and ECI.}

Teaching was conducted primarily using a lecture-based format. The Therapeutic Revolution of the 1930s heralded an explosion in the number and types of therapies available. As therapy has evolved so has teaching. Didactic teaching has, in many cases, been replaced by active learning and the health professions curriculum has shifted from an instructor-centered and discipline-based to a learner-centered, competence-based model. Pharmacology as a stand-alone discipline has largely been integrated into systems based or other modes of teaching. Assessments have also evolved from traditional examination formats that emphasized rote knowledge memorization to other assessment formats such as objective structured clinical examinations that emphasize evaluation of skills and attitudes. It has been challenging to define the best modalities given the wide variances in health professions education and the structure of health care systems internationally. Nonetheless, International collaboration efforts have been crucial to define core competencies which can then be used to guide curricular development. Challenges facing educators also include teaching ethical conduct of prescribing and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used in both teaching and evaluation, suggesting the need for on-going dialogue, continuing professional development and research in these important areas.}

We contribute to extant understanding of digital content marketing research in a B2B context by demonstrating that there are no universally correct sequences for presenting content to customers at different stages of the customer journey in order to systematically increase engagement. Instead, the findings suggest that the types of content customers prefer to see in different journey stages varies between individuals.

Reconditioning these batteries for reuse in vehicles or alternative applications presents a promising yet underexplored pathway. This study introduces a flexible simulation model combining discrete event and agent-based elements to estimate the long-term demand and supply of reconditioned electric vehicle batteries up to 2050. The model considers economic and regulatory factors, integrating the interests of key stakeholders, including original equipment manufacturers, recyclers, reconditioners, and consumers. A German case study demonstrates the viability of reconditioning, highlighting its niche role compared to recycling and repurposing. Key findings reveal that original equipment manufacturer decisions, particularly the use of reconditioned batteries in warranty cases, significantly influence market dynamics. Consumers' demand for reconditioned batteries depends on their quality, price, and greenhouse gas savings compared to new batteries. The study also examines the impacts of the EU Battery Regulation's recycled content mandates. The results underline the importance of aligning stakeholder strategies and regulatory frameworks to optimize end-of-life battery management. Promoting reconditioning can enhance circular economy practices while reducing environmental impacts, though challenges remain in aligning supply with demand and ensuring economic feasibility.}

In this regard, social and emotional competencies have been shown to be protective factors against the development of internet gaming disorder. Nevertheless, research on social and emotional learning is limited regarding their impact on the prevention of internet gaming disorder. In light of the significance of integrating social and emotional learning into school instruction, this study utilized a service-learning approach to facilitate this integration. The objective was to estimate the impact of a service-learning program based on social and emotional learning on the levels of social and emotional competencies and the prevention of internet gaming disorder among Spanish adolescents. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design, with the sample divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 54) and the control group (n = 54). The intervention group implemented a service-learning program on prevention measures against internet gaming addiction at their high school, receiving training in social and emotional competencies at the same time. The results indicate that the intervention group obtained a statistically significant improvement in social and emotional competencies and symptoms related to internet gaming disorder in comparison to the control group following the completion of the program. The obtained effect size indicates a large impact of the program. The present study proposes an innovative intervention that integrates service-learning and social and emotional learning to prevent video game addiction problems in high school students.
Resumen
El aumento sustancial en la prevalencia del trastorno por juego en internet en adolescentes ha generado un incremento en las investigaciones que se han desarrollado para determinar sus factores protectores, entre los que destacan las competencias sociales y emocionales. Sin embargo, la investigación sobre la efectividad del aprendizaje social y emocional para prevenir el trastorno por juego en internet es limitada. Dada la importancia de integrar el aprendizaje social y emocional en la instrucción escolar, este estudio ha utilizado el aprendizaje-servicio para facilitar esta integración. El objetivo ha sido determinar el impacto de un programa de aprendizaje-servicio basado en el aprendizaje social y emocional sobre las competencias sociales y emocionales y la prevención del trastorno por juego en internet en adolescentes españoles. El estudio ha adoptado un diseño cuasiexperimental, con la muestra dividida en dos: el grupo de intervención (n = 54) y el grupo de control (n = 54). El grupo de intervención ha implementado un programa de aprendizaje-servicio sobre medidas de prevención de la adicción a los videojuegos en su centro educativo, recibiendo simultáneamente entrenamiento en competencias sociales y emocionales. Los resultados indican que el grupo de intervención ha mejorado sus competencias sociales y emocionales y síntomas relacionados con el trastorno por videojuegos en comparación con el grupo de control. El tamaño del efecto obtenido indica un gran impacto del programa. Este estudio propone una intervención innovadora que integra el aprendizaje-servicio y el aprendizaje social y emocional para prevenir los problemas de adicción a los videojuegos en adolescentes.}

To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.}

Recently, using image data and deep learning to investigate the interactions between humans and urban infrastructure has been a popular approach since the fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the convergence of data fusion, deep learning, and human-urban infrastructure interaction studies remains underexplored. Here we systematically analyze 3,552 papers from 2013 to 2023 that use image data to investigate the intersection area of data fusion, deep learning, and human and urban infrastructure interactions, aiming to elucidate the relationships among these three key elements. We found that the cross-applications of deep learning in the papers reviewed are not standardized. Given the trend of diversified data fusion, data fusion about real-world dynamic interactions is scarce. Lastly, four potential future research directions are identified: (1) understanding the dynamic and complex interaction processes; (2) exploring the potential and standards for the application of deep learning; (3) focusing more on research concerning cities in the Global South; (4) establishing suitable training datasets for the interaction between urban infrastructures and humans, which may provide valuable insights for applying foundation models in future urban studies.}

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are vital therapeutic tools to counteract both pandemic and seasonal influenza threats. Traditional strategies for optimizing nAbs generally rely on labor-intensive, high-throughput mutagenesis screens. Here, we present an innovative structure-based design framework for the optimization of nAbs, which integrates epitope-paratope analysis, computational modeling, and rational design approaches, complemented by comprehensive experimental assessment. This approach was applied to optimize MEDI8852, a nAb targeting the stalk region of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). The resulting variant, M18.1.2.2, shows a marked enhancement in both affinity and neutralizing efficacy, as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Computational modeling reveals that this improvement can be attributed to the fine-tuning of interactions between the antibody’s side-chains and the epitope residues that are highly conserved across the influenza A virus HA stalk. Our dry-wet iterative protocol for nAb optimization presented here yielded a promising candidate for influenza intervention.}

This can easily lead to poor decision-making, resulting in the designs that do not meet the user’s preferences. Therefore, this paper proposed an expert decision support system for product bionic design that integrates emotional preferences and image generation to support designers in the Biologically Inspired Design (BID) process. This paper took the electric kettle as a case study. First, the biological features are matched with the product semantics to propose the bionic conversion factor. Users’ emotional preferences are analyzed to build a correlation model with the bionic conversion factors, thereby calculating product preference data. Second, the raw biometric data is calculated based on the bionic conversion factors. An intuitive fuzzy number emotional scale is used to measure users’ preferences for these bionic features. A linear function model is constructed between user preferences and the bionic conversion factors to calculate biological preference data. By fitting the product preference data, bionic creatures that align with user preferences are selected. Finally, eye-tracking experiments are conducted to identify the critical biological features. StyleGAN is then applied to integrate these features with product images, resulting in a conceptual solution that serves as a reference for designers. Based on the analysis of users concerned emotional needs, the designer optimizes the details of the concept design to create the final product scheme. User evaluation of the design outputs shows that the electric kettle designed by the proposed system has the highest score and meets the user’s expectations, which verifies the effectiveness and scientificity.}

abstract = {Model-based virtual sensing offers a viable approach for monitoring fatigue loads on operational offshore wind turbines. These methods combine response measurements with first-principle, or data-informed models, to estimate load time series at hard-to-access locations. However, their accuracy depends on the fidelity of the underlying model, which is largely influenced by uncertainties in the soil–structure interaction (SSI) models. This study evaluates the impact of different SSI modelling approaches in terms of a virtual sensing validation study targeting strain estimation above and below the mudline of a bottom-founded offshore wind turbine. To this end, different numerical models derived from, and validated against, design documentation serve as input to a dual-band modal decomposition and expansion (MDE) method. The considered SSI models range from an API/DNV-based foundation model to a PISA-based model including scour protection. Virtual sensing results are generated for two-year equivalent datasets, obtained for three operational offshore wind turbines, each equipped with extensive load monitoring systems. One turbine is used to assess the effect of the model updates, while two additional turbines are used to assess the across-site consistency. The estimated strains are directly compared against available strain validation data, in terms of damage-equivalent stress, and are accumulated to give a single comparative metric representative for the two-year periods. Results show that PISA-based soil reaction curves significantly improve agreement with measured strains while adding a scour protection model has a relatively smaller impact. These findings highlight the importance of accurate foundation modelling in virtual sensing and demonstrate the feasibility of fatigue monitoring at hard-to-access locations.}

Asarum heterotropoides F. Schmidt (ARR) has a well-documented history of traditional use in East Asia for musculoskeletal pain disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA), attributed to its significant anti-inflammatory properties. While preliminary studies suggest potential anti-inflammatory effects, conclusive evidence regarding the ability of ARRs to modulate the multiple inflammatory pathologies involved in OA pathogenesis is currently lacking.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to experimentally evaluate the effects of ARR extract on pain, cartilage integrity, and inflammatory responses using in vitro and in vivo models relevant to OA, guided by initial computational predictions.
Materials and methods
Active ingredients of ARRs were retrieved from four databases and screened using SwissADME for ADME predictions. Disease targets were combined with OA-related genes from GEO microarray database. The intersecting genes underwent protein-protein interaction construction, GO, and KEGG enrichment analysis. A compound-target-pathway network was constructed using Cytoscape and was validated via molecular docking. Pain-relieving, functional, and chondroprotective effects were assessed in vivo using acetic acid-induced peripheral pain mice and monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis rat models. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory properties were explored by evaluating serum cartilage tissue and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
Results
Network pharmacology analysis elucidated five principal active constituents of ARR (cryptopine, 5-[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-2,3-dimethoxy-phenol, 5-[2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzene-1,3-diol, naringenin, resorstatin) alongside 22 putative herbal targets. Molecular docking analyses revealed strong binding affinities (−8 to −9.4 kcal/mol) of these constituents towards principal target proteins. Functional GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that ARR exerts its effects potentially involving pathways associated with cancer, fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis. In vivo assessments demonstrated significant mitigation of pain, functional deficits, and cartilage degradation by ARR within an MIA-induced osteoarthritis model. Molecular dynamics simulations validated stable interactions between the primary compounds and their designated target proteins. The therapeutic efficacy of ARR was characterized by dose-dependent suppression of diverse inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -3, -8, -13), and signaling pathways including CCND1, CDK2, IKBKB, HIF1A, BDKRB1, SIRT1, MAPK8, and NLRP3 within both RAW264.7 cells and articular cartilage tissue.
Conclusions
This investigation demonstrates that ARR exerts pain alleviation, functional enhancement, and chondroprotective effects in osteoarthritis via multi-target anti-inflammatory actions. Integrating network pharmacology, molecular docking, animal models, and cellular experiments, this study comprehensively elucidated the multifaceted anti-inflammatory mechanisms attributed to ARR. These findings collectively provide a crucial foundation for understanding the potential therapeutic efficacy and operative mechanisms of ARR for osteoarthritis management.}

A systematic review methodology, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was employed to analyse studies from 2017 to 2025, identifying the AI algorithms most frequently used to personalise gaming experiences, improve patient engagement, and increase treatment efficacy. Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment. This review offers valuable insights for researchers in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the suitability of different AI algorithms for various tasks in SGs, with a particular focus on personalisation and motivation.}

In this study, we empirically analyze 472 live streams to explore the curvilinear effects of the number of products and stay time on livestream shopping sales. Our findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between the total number of products and the average audience stay time with sales.

Collaboration data, such as Git pulls and pushes from the GitHub Innovation Graph from 2020 to 2023, were adopted as primary sources. Around 190 eligible economies were included in the analysis based on their collaboration efforts. The study constructed a directed, weighted network to map these collaborations, identify key economies, and validate the small-world phenomenon discussed by Watts and Strogatz in 1998. Network centrality statistics were summarized, and network communities were identified. The small-world phenomenon was validated by benchmarking the small-worldness index proposed by Humphries and Gurney in 2008. Furthermore, this study shows that variations in developer counts, repository volumes, or organization presence do not significantly influence an economy’s centrality measures, such as closeness and eigenvector centralities.}

abstract = {Background
Although physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and well-being, physical inactivity is a worldwide problem. Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategies improves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressed personalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing on persuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventions and corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing.
Objective
First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobile health interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying ML techniques in this field.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA. Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belonged to, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and study details. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given.
Results
In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groups based on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found together with a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasive strategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning to personalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-setting messages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback or educational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommender system. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages.
Conclusions
The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for this interdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additional layers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies.}

abstract = {Background
Cochlear implants are implanted hearing devices; instead of amplifying sounds like common hearing aids, this technology delivers preprocessed sound information directly to the hearing (ie, auditory) nerves. After surgery and the first cochlear implant activation, patients must practice interpreting the new auditory sensations, especially for language comprehension. This rehabilitation process is accompanied by hearing therapy through face-to-face training with a therapist, self-directed training, and computer-based auditory training.
Objective
In general, self-directed, computer-based auditory training tasks have already shown advantages. However, compliance of cochlear implant recipients is still a major factor, especially for self-directed training at home. Hence, we aimed to explore the combination of 2 techniques to enhance learner motivation in this context: adaptive learning (in the form of an intelligent tutoring system) and game-based learning (in the form of a serious game).
Methods
Following the suggestions of the evidence-centered design framework, a domain analysis of hearing therapy was conducted, allowing us to partially describe human hearing skill as a probabilistic competence model (Bayesian network). We developed an algorithm that uses such a model to estimate the current competence level of a patient and create training recommendations. For training, our developed task system was based on 7 language comprehension task types that act as a blueprint for generating tasks of diverse difficulty automatically. To achieve this, 1053 audio assets with meta-information labels were created. We embedded the adaptive task system into a graphic novel–like mobile serious game. German-speaking cochlear implant recipients used the system during a feasibility study for 4 weeks.
Results
The 23 adult participants (20 women; 3 men) fulfilled 2259 tasks. In total, 2004 (90.5%) tasks were solved correctly, and 255 (9.5%) tasks were solved incorrectly. A generalized additive model analysis of these tasks indicated that the system adapted to the estimated competency levels of the cochlear implant recipients more quickly in the beginning than at the end. Compared with a uniform distribution of all task types, the recommended task types differed (χ²6=86.713; P<.001), indicating that the system selected specific task types for each patient. This is underlined by the identified categories for the error proportions of the task types.
Conclusions
This contribution demonstrates the feasibility of combining an intelligent tutoring system with a serious game in cochlear implant rehabilitation therapies. The findings presented here could lead to further advances in cochlear implant care and aural rehabilitation in general.

abstract = {Childhood exposure to social adversity – including experiences such as poverty, discrimination, violence, family separation, household dysfunction, and maltreatment – is associated with cardiometabolic health problems across the life course. A key question in the field is whether the timing of social adversity matters. To better understand the developmental origins of cardiometabolic disease and the emergence of health disparities, we conducted a systematic review of human observational studies to synthesize the evidence for sensitive periods to social adversity in immune and metabolic development. To be included in the study, some form of social adversity had to be independently reported at two or more non-overlapping time points during the prenatal period or childhood (<21 years old) and studies were required to include an outcome relevant to immune and/or metabolic biomarkers measured at some time after the social adversity exposure. Of the 2440 unique records screened, 25 met criteria for inclusion. Twenty studies investigated sensitive periods in immune development and six in metabolic development. For immune development, studies identified sensitive periods to social adversity inconsistently from the prenatal period through age 18. However, the proportion of studies confirming sensitive periods was highest at the youngest stages of development and gradually decreased across the life course. 50 % of studies found significant sensitive period effects in the prenatal period, while only 20 % found significant effects in late adolescence. For metabolic development, studies identified sensitive periods more consistently from birth through age 12. The proportion of studies reporting sensitive periods peaked at 50 % in infancy and decreased to zero after preadolescence. Overall, we found insufficient evidence to identify precise periods during which specific social adversity exposures have been consistently associated with altered immune and metabolic development. More birth cohorts with repeated measures of both social exposures and immune and metabolic biomarkers are needed, as are studies leveraging causal inference methods to more robustly account for time-varying confounding. However, these limitations notwithstanding, our review finds evidence that early experiences matter for immune and metabolic functioning. Improving the social and economic circumstances of young children may benefit lifelong cardiometabolic health.}

abstract = {Demand flexibility is becoming increasingly vital to ensure stability and reliability in power systems by managing the fluctuating generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) and increasing electricity demand. This study proposes a novel method to evaluate the demand flexibility of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings based on real-world data. To reflect the thermal dynamic response of HVAC systems, a data-driven model utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) with online learning is developed, enhancing modeling accuracy using historical operation data. Considering the replicated ANN model, the optimal Demand Response (DR) schedules in response to Time-Of-Use (TOU) prices from the grid operator are determined to minimize building electricity costs. Consequently, the flexibility quantification of HVAC systems is evaluated by comparing the derived optimal DR schedules with baseline consumption. Case studies simulated using real-world data from South Korea demonstrate that the demand flexibility of HVAC systems can effectively provide overall grid flexibility, even when solely responding to commonly used TOU prices. The proposed flexibility evaluation method is valuable for grid operators in managing grid problems that arise from the increasing integration of RESs and rising electricity demand, from a stable network operation perspective.}

Many studies use concept maps, a visualized tool, to aid in this process. It is crucial to look into the ways that groups of three or more people construct knowledge and to combine implicit physiological data with explicit data. In this study, we combined content analysis, ordered network analysis (ONA), and hyperscanning technology based on electroencephalograms (EEG) to analyze the data of 28 triads of high- and low-achievement groups that participated in collaborative concept mapping tasks. The frequency statistics showed that the low-achievement groups have significantly higher monitoring and adapting behavior frequencies at the individual level in the regulation dimension than the high-achievement groups. The ONA results further illustrated the sequence of knowledge transfer based on the frequency analysis. The cognitive patterns of high-achievement groups showed a cycle that began at the group level of cognition, moved to the peer level of cognition, then to the group level of regulation, and ultimately returned to the group level of cognition. The low-achievement groups' cognitive patterns also exhibited directionality, moving from the group level of regulation to the individual level of cognition and to the group level of cognition. From the implicit perspective, the theta band and temporal-parietal regions showed greater inter-brain synchrony in the high-achievement groups. Low-achievement groups, on the other hand, had comparatively lower synchrony. Their consensus was only superficial and concentrated on ensuring that everyone participated through regulation and thought integration to finish the task. Our study's findings can help teachers and instructional designers develop tailored interventions based on differences in learners' cognitive patterns during collaborative concept mapping tasks.}

This study investigates the utility of LLMs—specifically various base and fine-tuned GPT models—for the automatic assignment of ontological identifiers to biological sample labels. We evaluated model performance in annotating labels to four widely used ontologies: the Cell Line Ontology (CLO), Cell Ontology (CL), Uber-anatomy Ontology (UBERON), and BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO). Our dataset was compiled from publicly available, high-quality databases containing biologically relevant sequence information, which suffers from inconsistent annotation practices, complicating integrative analyses. Model outputs were compared against annotations generated by text2term, a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The fine-tuned GPT model outperformed both the base models and text2term in annotating cell lines and cell types, particularly for the CL and UBERON ontologies, achieving a precision of 47–64% and a recall of 88–97%. In contrast, base models exhibited significantly lower performance. These results suggest that fine-tuned LLMs can accelerate and improve the accuracy of biological data annotation. Nonetheless, our evaluation highlights persistent challenges, including variable precision across ontology categories and the continued need for expert curation to ensure annotation validity.}

The growing clinical success of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) has led to rapid interest in leveraging dual targeting in order to generate novel modes of therapeutic action beyond mono-targeting approaches. While bsAbs that bind targets on two different cells (trans-targeting) are showing promise in the clinic, the co-targeting of two proteins on the same cell surface through cis-targeting bsAbs (cis-bsAbs) is an emerging strategy to elicit new functionalities. This includes the ability to induce proximity, enhance binding to a target, increase target/cell selectivity, and/or co-modulate function on the cell surface with the goal of altering, reversing, or eradicating abnormal cellular activity that contributes to disease. In this review, we focus on the impact of cis-bsAbs in the clinic, their emerging applications, and untangle the intricacies of improving bsAb discovery and development.}

The processes of formation of this fallout remain unclear. Here, we show how the oxygen and silicon isotopic compositions of three trinitites allow to refine their formation scenario. The three samples are typical of trinitites, being composed of various crystalline phases and of glassy phases divided into three chemical groups (CaMgFe, alkali, silica) that are mixed in various proportions in the three samples. The three samples show a large range of oxygen and silicon isotopic variations (−10.9 ± 0.6 < δ30Si < 4.2 ± 0.6 ‰, and 2.3 ± 0.4 < δ18O < 24.2 ± 0.5 ‰). At variance with the Hiroshima fallout deposits, no oxygen mass-independent isotopic fractionation was found in the three trinitites. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the chemical groups reveal that they result from different processes: the silica phases are molten fragments of the site material, while the CaMgFe and alkali phases are produced by the mixing of condensates and molten site material. Models show that the observed silicon isotopic variations resulted from Rayleigh distillation during condensation of the gaseous species injected into the cloud, while the variability in composition of the site materials also played an important role for controlling the oxygen isotopic compositions. From these observations, a general scenario, beginning with the vaporization of the site surface, producing a depression, is proposed. The vaporized material condensed and grew by agglomeration with other condensates and liquid materials. These agglomerates rained on the surface and quenched, forming the trinitites. This scenario is different from the formation of the Hiroshima glasses but shows some similarities to tektite formation.}

Many models of fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous, meaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size spectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always analytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in which the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type model whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight, may differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the size spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability density of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified version and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the first model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis as a keystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed size spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the stochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by environmental fluctuations.}

abstract = {Background
Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignancy characterized by the absence of reliable prognostic indicators and effective therapeutic targets. Claudin-9 (CLDN9) has been demonstrated to be upregulated in various cancers. However, its prognostic value, biological function, and regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of CLDN9 in GC progression and its underlying mechanisms.
Methods
We utilized consensus cluster, random survival forest, and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify CLDN9 in GC. Subsequently, we evaluated the mRNA and protein levels of CLDN9 in GC using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the role of CLDN9 in GC progression was investigated using a series of functional in vivo and in vitro experiments. Finally, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CLDN9 using bioinformatics, molecular biology, animal models, and patient tissue specimens.
Results
Two GC subtypes with survival and functional differences were identified based on glycolytic metabolic genes in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)- Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset. A prognostic risk score was calculated using seven genes to assess the overall survival (OS) in GC. Using random survival forest and multivariate Cox analyses, we identified CLDN9 as the key gene linked to the glycolytic subtype and prognosis of GC. CLDN9 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with GC as well as in GC cells. CLDN9 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CLDN9 was found to regulate lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression and promote glycolytic metabolism by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) signaling pathway. Additionally, lactate, a glycolytic metabolite, enhanced programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) lactylation and stability, which suppressed anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to GC progression.
Conclusions
CLDN9 expression is associated with GC development and progression. Mechanistically, CLDN9 enhances the glycolysis pathway and facilitates PD-L1 lactylation through the PI3K/AKT/HIF1α signaling pathway, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells. CLDN9 has the potential to serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.}

Termed as the nuclear paradox, this dual framing of nuclear energy often oscillates between promise and peril depending on which aspect of its duality appears more immediate, leaving society to navigate the difficult trade-offs. This study re-examines the structural shortcomings of the first nuclear era and outlines the conditions necessary for a more resilient second phase of nuclear development in the context of today's evolving energy market. It argues that the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR), through its distinctive reactor design and fuel cycle, offers a comprehensive response to long-standing concerns about safety, economic viability, proliferation, and waste permanence—exemplified by the ill-fated concept of the Atomic Priesthood. The analysis concludes with concrete policy recommendations to accelerate LFTR research and implementation, contributing to the realization of a more secure and sustainable nuclear energy future.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel Deep Learning (DL) framework for cotton plant disease prediction based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Copula entropy based-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The suggested framework uses a cotton plant image as input and pre-processes it to produce an image with enhanced contrast. Features are extracted from the leaf images with the ResNet50 CNN model. A crucial pre-processing model known as feature selection helps to improve the effectiveness of image classification by deleting extraneous or irrelevant features. Therefore, the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm which is a global search method with potential use in feature selection is employed in this paper. The proposed framework introduces Copula entropy (CE) as an indicator of association to create the GWO’s initial population and enhance the GWO feature engineering process. For the GWO initialization procedure, CE has been used to choose the most significant features which substantially improved the quality of the GWO starting population and as a result improved the performance of the proposed CE-based GWO algorithm by 78.57 % faster than the traditional GWO as stated by the time complexity analysis. In addition, Feature importance explanation is determined using XAI layer. The final classification is achieved using Random Forests (RF) classifier which is an ensemble learning approach. According to the experimental results, the suggested model has a classification accuracy of 99 % and a mean squared error of 0.0383. Furthermore, the proposed model has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and the results showed that the proposed model has the superiority performance. The proposed model can therefore be used to track a variety of cotton areas to enable faster analysis and response, resulting in higher productivity.}

abstract = {Physics-based hydrodynamic models are essential for accurate flood prediction but are computationally expensive, limiting their applicability for real-time forecasting and probabilistic analyses. Conversely, pure machine learning (ML) models offer both computational efficiency and accuracy but often lack interpretability. To address this gap, we propose SGUnet, a physics-informed ML model and a hybrid theory-guided data science approach, for rapid, high-resolution flood mapping. It utilizes a neural network with U-Net architecture and integrates subgrid-based coarse-grid hydrodynamic model predictions as initial estimates, upskilling them to achieve fine-grid model accuracy. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic models, the subgrid method embeds fine-scale topographic details within coarse-grid cells, enhancing both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. SGUnet processes flood depth raster patches (512 × 512 pixels) and corresponding digital elevation models as inputs. It functions as a deep learning-based corrector, refining flood predictions from numerical simulators. Trained through supervised learning, SGUnet learns to correct deviations in coarse-grid predictions using fine-grid model outputs as target values. The model is evaluated across three large Australian watersheds—Wollombi, Chowilla, and Burnett River—using HEC-RAS flood simulations with subgrid formulation. SGUnet reduces root mean squared error by a factor of 4.5–5.3 compared to coarse-grid models, achieves a critical success index exceeding 0.9 for flood extent mapping, and delivers a 50x speed-up over fine-grid hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, SGUnet outperforms a state-of-the-art ML-based upskilling model in depth and extent predictions. By effectively correcting flood artifacts from coarse-grid models, SGUnet achieves near fine-grid accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, demonstrating its potential for real-time flood risk assessment.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) models struggle to reach performance levels due to the complex nature of Arabic grammar and diverse regional dialects. This study investigated how generative AI (GenAI) functions as a teaching assistant in Arabic language classrooms. Using qualitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 instructors; the data was then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that instructors used GenAI to create material, assess students’ work, and create personalized learning plans. Instructors struggled, however, with AI accuracy in dialect processing, cultural authenticity, and ensuring accurate assessment methods. The analysis raised significant gaps in teacher training, assessment strategies, and institutional guidelines. Instructors found it challenging to evaluate AI-generated Arabic content across different dialects and maintain academic integrity in student assignments. This study recommends developing instructor training, specifically on using GenAI tools for Arabic dialect variations and creating culturally appropriate Arabic language learning materials.}

These perturbations can significantly degrade model performance and introduce multifaceted societal risks. To verify the safe robustness of VLMs and further inspire the design of defensive AI frameworks, we propose Virtual Scenario Hypnosis (VSH), a multimodal prompt injection jailbreak method that embeds malicious queries into prompts through a deceptive narrative framework. This approach strategically distracts the model while compromising its resistance to jailbreak attempts. Our methodology features two key innovations: 1) Targeted adversarial image prompts that transform textual content into visual layouts through optimized typographic designs, circumventing safety alignment mechanisms to elicit harmful responses; and 2) An information veil encrypted In-Context Learning (ICL) method for text prompts that systematically evades safety detection protocols. To streamline evaluation, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate an efficient assessment of jailbreak success rates, supported by a meticulously designed prompt template incorporating multi-dimensional scoring rules and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VSH, achieving an overall success rate exceeding 82% on 500 harmful queries spanning multiple domains when tested against LLaVA-v1.5-13B and GPT-4o mini.}

The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students’ intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined.}

By analyzing objective data from 512 equity crowdfunding projects within the Chinese hotel industry, our findings indicate that the combination of product- and firm-related substantive signals, such as price and team size, enhances both the amount and percentage of equity-based crowdfunding. Furthermore, our results unveil that the combination of product-related substantive (price) and rhetorical (emotional appeal) signals significantly contributes to equity-based crowdfunding success.

Traditional detection systems often fail to identify stealthy and sophisticated attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), ARP poisoning, and reconnaissance scans. Moreover, many existing methods lack transparency and produce reports that are difficult for analysts to interpret, slowing both threat comprehension and response. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel methodology that integrates Knowledge Graphs, XAI techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance network threat detection, classification, explainability, and automated reporting. The proposed approach employs Graph-BERT to encode complex communication patterns and semantic relationships into enriched knowledge graphs constructed from network logs. To ensure model transparency and interpretability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated, while structured prompts guide report generation using Generative AI. Experimental results obtained on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the methodology achieves a classification accuracy exceeding 84 %, outperforming existing detection techniques. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation involving ablation analysis, LLM-based assessments, and expert reviews shows that incorporating structured knowledge and explainability significantly enhances the clarity, correctness, and informativeness of generated reports. These findings confirm the system’s effectiveness both as a detection mechanism and as a practical tool that helps analysts understand threats and craft informed responses.}

The isolated EJ-ELNs demonstrated excellent colloidal stability, maintaining structural integrity under simulated gastrointestinal fluid, enzymatic degradation (DNase, RNase, Proteinase K) and acidic conditions (pH 2), and diverse storage conditions (25 °C, 4 °C, −80 °C, and lyophilization). In vitro, EJ-ELNs promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation by upregulating surface molecules and enhancing the secretion of Th1-polarizing cytokine, while suppressing antigen uptake via MAPK and NF-κB pathways. These activated DCs facilitated the differentiation of naïve T cells into IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells and promoted the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. In vivo, oral administration of EJ-ELNs restored DC function and expanded polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, ultimately leading to significant tumor suppression. Lipidomic and metabolomic profiling identified ceramide, Hex1Cer, naringenin, and genistein as key immunostimulatory constituents. These findings position EJ-ELNs as a novel anti-cancer nutraceutical candidate, offering a promising strategy for immune activation and tumor suppression in functional food applications.}

This study consulted fifteen key informants from academic, policy, and operational sectors globally to identify policies that would ensure responsible deployment. Through reflexive thematic analysis, seven key policy themes emerged: implementing regulation and standards; enhancing infrastructure and traffic management for effective integration; integrating with public transport; promoting value-driven approaches to policymaking; enhancing road safety; promoting shared responsibility between automated systems and VRUs; and building public trust and acceptance. Participants highlighted the importance of conservative safety designs for CAVs, advanced infrastructure for VRU-heavy areas, the implementation of reliable sensor technology, and national standards for effective traffic management. Additionally, human-centric design, particularly accessibility for people with disabilities, was reinforced. To facilitate safe and just adoption of this technology, we propose policy recommendations that governments should implement to improve interactions between CAVs and VRUs. These are framed around four key policy levers: regulation, provisions, economic incentives, and exhortation. Each lever offers distinct policy approaches that guide the sustainable development of the technology, ensuring alignment with justice and safety outcomes. Future research should prioritise understanding public perspectives and optimising automated–VRU interactions to support a more equitable transport system.}

abstract = {Background
Many Korean American older adults have limited English proficiency, have low socioeconomic status, and are immigrants. The availability and accessibility of linguistic and culturally appropriate dementia-related health care and caregiving resources for this population are limited. This is concerning given that Korean American older adults are a rapidly growing population, and Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a significant public health issue.
Objective
We aimed to assess changes in pre- and posttest knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding ADRD prevention and caregiving among participants in the Koreans Invested in Making Caregivers’ Health Important (KIMCHI) before and after their participation in KIMCHI workshop presentations.
Methods
A community engagement dissemination project, KIMCHI, was developed by academic and community partners to culturally and linguistically tailor selected evidence-based research from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute for Korean American older adults, caregivers, and other stakeholders. Dissemination activities were conducted in-person (as workshops) and on digital platforms. Through partnerships with 1 academic institution and 2 community organizations that serve Korean Americans, 211 participants participated in the KIMCHI in-person workshop presentations, and 134 participants participated asynchronously online (via fact sheets on the project website, YouTube videos, and other social media, such as Facebook and X [formerly known as Twitter]). Pre- and postparticipation tests on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for ADRD and caregiving were conducted with workshop participants. We administered satisfaction surveys to all participants (workshop and online) and conducted two-tailed paired-sample 2-tailed t tests to assess mean changes in the pre- and postparticipation tests.
Results
Among the workshop participants (N=211), most (114/204, 55.9%) were older adults (mean age 69, SD 12.1 y; range 24-90 y), female (n=148, 70.1%), and foreign-born (n=203, 96.2%). Many reported having limited English proficiency (167/211, 79.1%). Significant changes were observed in posttest ADRD knowledge (mean 11.51, SD 2.64), attitudes (mean 7.13, SD 2.83), and behaviors (mean 8.88, SD 2.72) compared to pretest scores (knowledge: mean 10.34, SD 2.67; t210=1.17; P<.001; attitudes: mean 6.33, SD 2.44; t210=0.8; P<.001; and behaviors: mean 8.11, SD 2.68; t210=0.76; P<.001). Workshop participants reported high satisfaction (196/209, 93.8%) with KIMCHI, with the workshop presentations being perceived as culturally relevant and applicable (196/209, 93.8%). Most workshop participants expressed interest in learning more about ADRD-related health topics (186/209, 89%). Similarly, the online participants (N=134) expressed high satisfaction (115/134, 85.8%) and agreed that the topics and content were culturally relevant and applicable (116/133, 87.2%) and learned new information (110/134, 82.1%).
Conclusions
The findings indicate that KIMCHI may have a positive impact on improving ADRD knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Korean Americans. Academic-community collaborations should continue to culturally tailor the programs and studies to help ensure greater representation of Korean Americans in research and community engagement projects.}

A central challenge lies in elucidating the multiscale mass transport mechanisms of multicomponent fluids within nanopores. However, traditional micro-nano scale models fail to describe the nonlinear features inherent in non-equilibrium transport processes accurately. By integrating multi-physical feature datasets such as pore size distribution, surface potential, and salt concentration, machine learning (ML) can capture nonlinear correlations between membrane structural parameters and mass transfer kinetics, thereby enhancing the spatiotemporal resolution and computational efficiency of fluid transport process simulations. Meanwhile, this data-driven modeling framework that integrates underlying physical fields allows for optimizing polymer molecular structures based on target properties, thus revolutionizing the design process of membrane materials. Therefore, this review focuses on the construction of ML-accelerated multiscale models for mass transfer based on nanofiltration membranes in the desalination process, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and coarse-grained simulations (GCMD and DPD). It also summarizes the “closed-loop” inverse design framework for desalination membrane materials derived from the powerful data-driven capabilities of ML, and analyzes how to inverse derive and optimize the structural parameters and preparation conditions of membrane materials based on target desalination performance requirements. Finally, we discuss the future research directions for ML-assisted NF membrane mass transfer modeling and inverse design, guiding the development of next-generation high-performance intelligent seawater desalination NF membranes.}

Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive impact of AI is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, firms with optimistic managerial sentiment, high-polluting industries, and high-tech sectors. These findings contribute to the technology-sustainability literature by developing an integrated theoretical framework combining the resource-based view and stakeholder theory, and by identifying specific transmission mechanisms linking AI to ESG outcomes. Practically, the results provide valuable insights for policymakers implementing targeted AI policies, corporate managers pursuing strategic AI adoption, and investors incorporating AI metrics into sustainable investment decisions.}

abstract = {This study examined the influence of the different heat treatments on the surface and bulk properties and its comparison with the as-printed Ti-6Al-4V counterpart, fabricated through the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique for biomedical applications. Different heat treatment cycles as a post-processing step were incorporated at 670°C and 950°C to optimize phase stability, relieve residual stresses, and enhance material properties. The surface roughness analyses revealed substantial improvement in the surface properties, such as topography, undulation, and minimal pores, with the 950°C heat treatment cycle. The microstructural characterization demonstrated a transformation from α’ martensite to a lamellar α + β phase, reducing dislocation density and improving mechanical integrity, significantly affecting the microhardness and tensile strength with improved biological compatibility. The HT950 samples exhibited a 15% increase in hardness, while HT670 samples showed a 10% decrease compared to untreated samples. Wettability analysis revealed that HT950 samples achieved the highest SFE of 64.8 mN/m with a contact angle of 31.3°, demonstrating superior hydrophilicity along the build direction. Further, bio-tribological assessments highlighted superior wear resistance and reduced friction coefficients in heat-treated samples, particularly under the 950°C condition, attributed to a direct correlation with hardness and refined phase distribution. Biological evaluations using cell culture assays confirmed improved cell viability and adhesion in heat-treated specimens, exhibiting optimal biocompatibility for the 950°C treated sample. The findings underscore the critical role of heat treatment in tailoring the microstructural, mechanical, bio-tribological, and biological attributes of LPBF-produced Ti-6Al-4V for orthopedic implants. This research advances the understanding of post-processing strategies for enhanced durability and biocompatibility in biomedical implants.}

While interest in ChatGPT for educational applications is rising, there is a lack of empirical research exploring its effectiveness in fostering teacher creativity. Therefore, this timely study aims to fill this gap by investigating the efficacy of ChatGPT in facilitating creativity, particularly among English as a foreign (EFL) teachers. A total of twenty-nine teachers enrolled in a post-graduate program participated in the study. Conducting an inductive content analysis, teachers’ ChatGPT inquiry threads, lesson plans, written reflections, and responses to an open-ended survey were analysed. The analysis revealed that ChatGPT enabled teachers to (a) seek for novel perspectives, (b) explore multiple ideas, (c) expand on ideas, (d) change perspectives, (e) refer for information, (f) inquire about teaching tools, and (g) ask for information. Two challenges were also identified: (a) the need for precise input and (b) repetitive content. Building on these findings, a conceptual model is proposed that frames ChatGPT as a tool for creative ideation and a knowledge resource, facilitating EFL teachers' progression towards their Zone of Proximal Creativity, with its effectiveness contingent on the teacher's existing expertise.}

abstract = {Background
The digitalization of health care organizations is an integral part of a clinician’s daily life, making it vital for health care professionals (HCPs) to understand and effectively use digital tools in hospital settings. However, clinicians often express a lack of preparedness for their digital work environments. Particularly, new clinical end users, encompassing medical and nursing students, seasoned professionals transitioning to new health care environments, and experienced practitioners encountering new health care technologies, face critically intense learning periods, often with a lack of adequate time for learning digital tools, resulting in difficulties in integrating and adopting these digital tools into clinical practice.
Objective
This study aims to comprehensively collect advice from experienced HCPs in Switzerland to guide new clinical end users on how to initiate their engagement with health ITs within hospital settings.
Methods
We conducted qualitative interviews with 52 HCPs across Switzerland, representing 24 medical specialties from 14 hospitals. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Codes were developed iteratively, and themes and aggregated dimensions were refined through collaborative discussions.
Results
Ten themes emerged from the interview data, namely (1) digital tool understanding, (2) peer-based learning strategies, (3) experimental learning approaches, (4) knowledge exchange and support, (5) training approaches, (6) proactive innovation, (7) an adaptive technology mindset, (8) critical thinking approaches, (9) dealing with emotions, and (10) empathy and human factors. Consequently, we devised 10 recommendations with specific advice to new clinical end users on how to approach new health care technologies, encompassing the following: take time to get to know and understand the tools you are working with; proactively ask experienced colleagues; simply try it out and practice; know where to get help and information; take sufficient training; embrace curiosity and pursue innovation; maintain an open and adaptable mindset; keep thinking critically and use your knowledge base; overcome your fears, and never lose the human and patient focus.
Conclusions
Our study emphasized the importance of comprehensive training and learning approaches for health care technologies based on the advice and recommendations of experienced HCPs based in Swiss hospitals. Moreover, these recommendations have implications for medical educators and clinical instructors, providing advice on effective methods to instruct and support new end users, enabling them to use novel technologies proficiently. Therefore, we advocate for new clinical end users, health care institutions and clinical instructors, academic institutions and medical educators, and regulatory bodies to prioritize effective training and cultivating technological readiness to optimize IT use in health care.}

Our calculations reveal that these substitutions preferentially occupy surface sites on Fe2O3[001], rather than the bulk. Compared to alkaline earth metals, the surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evac), a measure of reducibility, is substantially lower near alkali substitutions, indicating more oxygen release. Additionally, we investigated H2 oxidation and adsorption on pure and Na-substituted Fe2O3[001] surfaces that have an oxygen vacancy. Adsorption energies demonstrate that H2 preferentially dissociates on O top and hollow sites rather than on Fe-related sites. The oxidation of H2 is both thermodynamically and kinetically more advantageous on O sites, resulting in the production of H2O via either direct adsorption or H atom migration pathways. Conversely, Fe sites demonstrate elevated steric hindrances and reduced reactivity. Finally, oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface was identified as a mechanism driven by high temperatures, which may influence oxygen availability during cycling. These findings offer essential understanding of the impact of substitutions on the redox behavior of Fe2O3 OCs, relevant to applications in chemical looping and sustainable hydrogen consumption.}

Based on the quantitative analysis of research trends and interests, it was found that while research trends were on the rise, they were still in the early stages, and research interests were somewhat concentrated on energy trading via smart contracts. In other words, the need to propose comprehensive future roadmaps to revitalize early-stage research in a limited field. Based on the qualitative analysis of research status by VPP components, research limitations that provide direction for future roadmaps were identified. As a result, two-level future roadmaps were proposed, consisting of function-level and integration-level roadmaps. Implementing blockchain in VPPs according to the proposed future roadmaps is expected to result in innovative performance enhancement for VPPs and significantly advance the goal of achieving zero carbon.}

This is especially evident the manufacturing sector, where innovation and competitive dynamics intersect with economic and social forces. The current academic discourse predominantly focuses on the qualitative identification and analysis of coopetition attributes, leaving a significant gap for large-scale quantitative studies to enable empirical assessment. This study aims to examine the significance of three groups of coopetition attributes for coopetition performance classified into two strategic (dynamics, paradoxicality), six relational (asymmetry, complexity, coopetition intensity, mutual dependence, strength, tensions), and five behavioral attributes (competition intensity, conflict, formality, investments, trust). Using data from 1216 manufacturing firms in Poland and employing a generalized Covariance based Structural Equation Model (CB-SEM), this study offers nuanced insights to the global discourse at the intersection of technological change and social dynamics. The results indicate that the strategic attribute paradoxicality, the relational attribute strength, and most of the behavioral attributes (trust, competition intensity, investments, formality) positively impact coopetition performance. Additionally, a significant negative impact of the strategic attribute dynamics was demonstrated, while no significant influence was identified for the remaining relational attributes (asymmetry, tensions) as well as the behavioral attribute conflict. Diverging from prior qualitative approaches, this study offers data-driven insights for decision-makers navigating societal and technological change, highlighting which attributes should be stimulated to enhance coopetition performance while minimizing the level of dynamics within coopetition strategies.}

Using a full sample of 1373 U.S. firm-year observations for which the client’s predecessor auditor reports an adverse SOX Section 404 internal control opinion, we find that in the following year a successor auditor who lowballs audit fees is more likely to issue a clean internal control opinion. The results hold when the predecessor auditors are dismissed, but not when the predecessors resign. We also find that firms are no more likely to succeed in opinion shopping when the proportion of audit committee financial experts is high. In addition, we find internal control opinion shopping occurs with initial fee discounting only in competitive audit markets and the period of a few years following the adoption of SOX (since 2007).}

Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities have become an important measure to combat online drug trafficking. Recently, machine learning has been applied to drug trafficking detection. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose knowledge-informed prompts, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we designed a Monte Carlo dropout-based prompt optimization method to further improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.}

A field study and six controlled experiments show that personalized upcycling elicits more positive consumer reactions compared to made-to-stock upcycling (i.e., upcycled products made from waste materials that a company generates itself or receives from its suppliers) and other green products, such as recycled products or secondhand products. This effect occurs because consumers already own the waste materials (i.e., what is mine) before they are transformed into a personalized upcycled product for them, which helps them see the trait of environmental consciousness embodied by personalized upcycled products in themselves (i.e., what is me)—referred to as pro-environmental activation. Finally, we investigate a socially important downstream consequence of personalized upcycling and demonstrate that the higher level of pro-environmental activation that consumers derive from personalized upcycling leads to enhanced pro-environmental behavior in areas beyond the product in question.}

The applicable range of the database is as follows: hydraulic diameter (0.00240–0.0240 m), pressure (1.00–158.00 bar), mass flux (27.50–7500.00 kg/m2s), and heat flux (0.006–8.520 MW/m2). Previous studies have largely focused on acquiring the void fraction distribution, with limited attention given to OSV calculations. To address this gap, we established a database that integrated 206 OSV data points calculated using graphical methods from 402 previously published void fraction distribution datasets. This was further supplemented with 246 verified OSV data points obtained from published literature, resulting in a comprehensive database of 452 OSV data points. Utilizing this database, we developed a new OSV correlation that introduces a novel criterion for flow boiling regions, based on Weber number of 10. This number delineates between a 'surface tension dominated flow region' and an 'inertia dominated flow region.' The new correlation outperformed nine other published correlations in terms of OSV prediction, exhibiting a mean error (ME) of 0.25 % and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 27.56 %.}

abstract = {Trauma emerges as a significant etiological factor associated with a wide range of psychopathologies, including anxiety, mood disorders, impulse dysregulation, psychosis, substance dependence, personality disorders, conduct issues, and suicidal behavior. Furthermore, trauma plays a central role in somatoform and alexithymic disorders, eating disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. Additionally, trauma is linked to the development of various physical health conditions such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer. Thus, the negative health consequences of trauma extend beyond PTSD and often manifest in personalized, polysymptomatic, and polysyndromic ways, suggesting the utility of adopting transdiagnostic approaches. This study focuses on validating the Arousal Modulation Model Questionnaire (AMMQ), grounded in Ogden and Minton's Arousal Modulation Model originating from Siegel's concept of the Window of Tolerance. The validation process encompasses multiple facets of questionnaire validation, including construct validity, reliability, and other psychometric properties. Participants included a sample of 304 individuals recruited for this study, with a mean age of 39.36 years (SD = 12.88). Although participants may have experienced one or more traumatic events in their lives, they were currently not under the care of the National Health Service Psychiatry Centers. Construct validity of the AMMQ was assessed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Initial exploratory factor analysis revealed a coherent factor structure consistent with theoretical expectations derived from the Arousal Modulation Model, yielding four distinct factors: "Optimal Arousal Zone" (OAZ, 7 items), "Fight/Flight" (FF, 4 items), Freeze (Fr, 6 items), and "Feigned Death" (FD, 5 items). Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis supported this structure, demonstrating excellent model fit (χ²(203) = 381.738, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.05). Internal consistency was high, with a mean categorical omega (ω) of 0.83 across all subscales, supporting the reliability of the AMMQ. Convergent validity was assessed by examining the associations between each AMMQ subscale and a set of established external measures. The Optimal Arousal Zone (OAZ) subscale showed strong positive correlations with all dimensions of psychological well-being (PWB-SF) and negative correlations with emotional distress (DASS-21), dissociation (DES-II). Conversely, all three dysregulation subscales—Fight-or-Flight (FF), Freeze (Fr), and Feigned Death (FD)—were positively associated with anxiety, depression, stress, and dissociation, as well as with increased autonomic reactivity measured by the BPQ-22 (all p < 0.001). The AMMQ test-retest reliability was also good (0.83). Overall, the validation results suggest that the Arousal Modulation Model Questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing arousal modulation processes within the context of stress reactivity. Its good psychometric properties make it a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers working in trauma-informed assessment and intervention. Finally, robust correlations between all AMMQ factors and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) scales (all p < 0.001) bolster its efficacy for transdiagnostic screening in psychotherapy, clinical research, and various psychological well-being interventions (e.g., mindfulness-based approaches).}

Ni1Zr1Al2-R, with specific surface area (SBET) of 145.6 m2, narrow pore size distribution of 7.1 nm, and small Ni0 particle size of 7.31 nm, showed 100 % furfural conversion and 94.5 % tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol selectivity under mild conditions (140 °C, 2 h). It was found that furfural was first hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol, which was further hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. XRD and TEM showed that Ni0 (111) plane played an important role on the catalytic hydrogenation process. Al increased the specific surface area (SBET) and total acid sites of the catalyst, providing more possibilities for the catalyst to contact the substrate. The introduction of Zr improved the ratio of medium acid sites and decreased the size of metal nickel particles, improving the resistance to carbon deposition and allowing the structure and catalytic performance to remain stable after five recycles.}

Despite its importance, there is limited moment-to-moment evidence on reading processes in multiple-text use. To bridge this gap, we used eye-tracking technology to see how task instructions affect reading multiple texts with high and low trustworthiness. The transitions among texts and source information, as well as how much attention the readers paid are particularly of concern. Sixty-one college students were randomly divided into summary and argument groups, tasked with writing a summary or an argument, respectively. Both groups read four texts presenting conflicting views on genetically modified technology. Each text featured high or low trustworthiness and included three paragraphs: source, evidence, and conclusion. Results of eye-movement data showed both groups spent more time rereading high-trustworthiness texts and evidence paragraphs. The summary group notably reread more on source information, made more transitions between source and evidence, and accessed texts more times than the argument group. In essay writing, the summary group showed better integration by using more source citations and connectives and referring to more concepts, compared to the argument group. Mediation analysis revealed that the process data of rereading time and number of click times successfully mediated the relationship between task instructions and multiple-text integration, confirming that the summary group engaged deeply. These findings offer both theoretical contributions and practical implications for developing adaptive, personalized digital reading environments.}

Today, procurement professionals increasingly require specialised skill sets, rather than generalist education, to effectively fulfil their role-specific responsibilities. This study integrates experiential learning theory with game-based learning by presenting a synthesised model that unites both perspectives. Building on this model, a purchasing-specific game is employed to compare traditional lecture-based teaching with experiential game-based learning, focusing on purchasing skills as well as cognitive and affective learning outcomes. The effectiveness of the game-based approach is examined through a group comparison experiment, contrasting students who played the game (N = 202) with those who attended conventional lectures (N = 135). The findings indicate that the game effectively develops purchasing and supply management (PSM) skills relevant to professional practice. Moreover, students evaluated the game as a highly positive learning experience, and it outperformed traditional lecturing in most skill-related, cognitive, and affective outcomes, ultimately leading to improved examination performance. For educators, the study highlights the design and implementation of the serious game, its pedagogical implications, and directions for future research in procurement education and beyond.}

abstract = {Software defect prediction (SDP) is crucial for improving software quality and optimizing resource allocation by identifying potential defects at early development stages. Traditional SDP methods rely on manually crafted static features, which often fail to capture the semantic and contextual information in code. Recent advances using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have improved semantic feature extraction, yet they often neglect structural dependencies and lack effective integration with static features. To address these limitations, this study proposes GLA-SDP, a novel defect prediction model that fuses features through the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an additive attention fusion mechanism. Specifically, a recursive AST-to-graph construction method is designed to extract rich semantic features using GCNs, while LSTMs are employed to capture sequential patterns from static code metrics. Furthermore, an attention-based fusion mechanism dynamically weight and combine semantic and static features, preserving their complementary importance in defect prediction. Extensive experiments on eight Java projects from the PROMISE dataset and four C-language projects from the Devign dataset demonstrate that GLA-SDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 37 % in F1-score and 24 % in MCC. These results highlight the superior accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed approach.}

Although the characteristics of a dam break wave after a complete dam break have been investigated extensively, studies on partial dam break processes have been rare. To this end, this paper proposed a hydraulic model for partial dam breaks based on the water flow through a sluice gate. Five different hydraulic models using 459 datasets of sluice gate flows from both experimental tests and the literature were evaluated. A stepwise algorithm was developed by combining the sluice gate flow model with the law of mass conservation; this algorithm was used to develop a predictive model for the flow and level of water during partial dam breaks. Based on the water-level data obtained from partial dam break simulations, the hydraulic model was improved by introducing time and submergence correction coefficients. Compared with the experimental results, the mean absolute percentage error of the corrected model was 1.572 %, indicating a high prediction accuracy. Consequently, the proposed model can provide important technical support for managing partial dam break.}

Through a systematic prompt design process, a synthetic dataset of 3585 images across 27 hazardous scenarios was generated. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the performance of DNN models trained on these virtual images, which achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of approximately 64% in object detection and 60% in segmentation tasks. This paper demonstrates the potential of text-to-image models in mitigating the scarcity of training data and enhancing the capability of DNNs to identify potential hazards.}

Soil recovery and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, such as organic farming, are essential to address this challenge. Smart organic farming improves soil quality, crop productivity, and water retention capacity. In this context, vermiculture, which utilizes Eisenia Foetida (red worms), plays a fundamental role. This article highlights how humus production through vermiculture has been significantly optimized through an Edge AIoT platform that integrates an agricultural recommendation system based on bio-inspired algorithms, an LSTM network for predicting humus and worm populations, and a control system to regulate variables such as temperature, humidity, and pH. The results show an increase in humus production from 37.58% to 87.88% and in the worm population from 35.5% to 83%. Vermicompost, obtained through the non-thermophilic biodegradation of organic waste by worms, acts as a crucial biofertilizer that sustainably increases crop yields and helps farmers adapt to environmental stresses, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Finally, seven experiments were conducted in which the Edge AIoT-based agricultural recommendation platform optimized the vermicomposting process, improving efficiency and productivity in humus production. This technological approach not only mitigates the impact of climate change but also supports the recovery of degraded soils and promotes sustainable agricultural practices essential for ensuring future food security.}

DL-based strategies have displayed superior performance in image processing compared to conventional standard methods, especially in healthcare settings. Among the biggest threats to global public health is the fast spread of malaria. The plasmodium falciparum infection, the disease origin causes the intestinal illness. Fortunately, advances in artificial intelligence techniques have made it possible to use visual data sets to quickly and effectively diagnose malaria which has also proven to be cost and time effective. In literature, several DL approaches have previously been used with good precision but suffer from computational inefficiency and interpretability. Therefore, this research proposes a generalized fractional order-based explainable lightweight convolutional neural network model to overcome these limitations. The fractional order optimization algorithms have proven worth in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence speed for different applications. The proposed fractional order optimizer-based model offers an improved solution to malaria disease diagnosis with a percentage accuracy of 95 % using the standard NIH dataset and outperforms the existing complex models concerning speed and effectiveness. The proposed fractionally optimized lightweight CNN model has shown substantial performance on the external MP-IDB dataset and M5 test set as well by achieving a generalized test accuracy of 92 % and 90.4 % which verifies the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution under available circumstances. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed lightweight architecture is endorsed through evaluation metrics of precision, recall, and F1-score.}

We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to 6 domains including genetic predisposition, circadian rhythms, physical activity and sedentary behavior, metabolomics, the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and economic disparities, particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to help manage obesity by addressing intra- and inter-individual variation as well as context, as opposed to “one-size fits all” approaches though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date.}

However, social feedback is not always immediate, and the impact of waiting time on social feedback processing remains unexplored. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study investigated how waiting time affects the N170, reward positivity (RewP), and P3. Participants (N = 36) completed a social evaluation task, awaiting feedback from liked and disliked peers with short (800–1200 ms) or long (5000–6000 ms) waiting times. Participants were more motivated to receive feedback from liked peers, and they rated acceptance from liked peers as more pleasant than rejection. Notably, participants found longer waits more worthwhile when receiving acceptance from liked peers, but less worthwhile when awaiting feedback from disliked peers. EEG results revealed that the RewP was increased for long waiting times for feedback from liked peers, and, conversely, reduced for long waiting times for feedback from disliked peers. Additionally, N170 and P3 were found to be sensitive to waiting time, with larger amplitudes for long compared to short waits. Overall, this study demonstrates that waiting time differentially affects social feedback processing, as reflected by changes in the N170, RewP, and P3. Our findings suggest that increased waiting time does not necessarily reduce reward value; it can enhance it depending on subjective social preferences. The increased N170 and P3 amplitudes during longer waits may indicate heightened attentional and memory demands. This study advances our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social decision-making.}

abstract = {Personalised dietary advice has become increasingly popular, currently however most approaches are based on an individual's genetic and phenotypic profile whilst largely ignoring other determinants such as socio economic and cognitive variables. This paper provides novel insights by testing the effectiveness of personalised healthy eating advice concurrently tailored to an individual's socio-demographic group, cognitive characteristics, and sensory preferences. We first used existing data to build a synthetic dataset based on information from 3654 households (Study 1a), and then developed a cluster model to identify individuals characterised by similar socio-demographic, cognitive, and sensory aspects (Study 1b). Finally, in Study 2 we used the characteristics of 8 clusters to build 8 separate personalised food choice advice and assess their ability to motivate the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables and decreased intakes of saturated fat and sugar. We presented 218 participants with either generic UK Government “EatWell” advice, advice that was tailored to their allocated cluster (matched personalised), or advice tailored to a different cluster (unmatched personalised). Results showed that, when compared to generic advice, participants that received matched personalised advice were significantly more likely to indicate they would change their diet. Participants were similarly motivated to increase vegetable consumption and decrease saturated fat intake when they received unmatched personalised advice, potentially highlighting the power of providing alternative food choices. Overall, this study demonstrated that the power of personalizing food choice advice, based on a combination of individual characteristics, can be more effective than current approaches in motivating dietary change. Our study also emphasizes the viability of addressing population health through automatically delivered web-based personalised advice.}

abstract = {Given the increasing number and severity of cyber attacks, there has been a surge in cybersecurity information across various mediums such as posts, news articles, reports, and other resources. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves processing data from these cybersecurity sources, enabling professionals and organizations to gain valuable insights. However, with the rapid dissemination of cybersecurity information, the inclusion of fake CTI can lead to severe consequences, including data poisoning attacks. To address this challenge, we have implemented a three-step strategy: generating synthetic CTI, evaluating the quality of the generated CTI, and detecting fake CTI. Unlike other subdomains, such as fake COVID news detection, there is currently no publicly available dataset specifically tailored for fake CTI detection research. To address this gap, we first establish a reliable groundtruth dataset by utilizing domain-specific cybersecurity data to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for synthetic CTI generation. We then employ crowdsourcing techniques and advanced synthetic data verification methods to evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, introducing a novel evaluation methodology that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that the generated CTI cannot be distinguished from genuine CTI by human annotators, regardless of their computer science background, demonstrating the effectiveness of our generation approach. We benchmark various misinformation detection techniques against our groundtruth dataset to establish baseline performance metrics for identifying fake CTI. By leveraging existing techniques and adapting them to the context of fake CTI detection, we provide a foundation for future research in this critical field. To facilitate further research, we make our code, dataset, and experimental results publicly available on GitHub.}

abstract = {Background
Despite a recent rise in adoption, telemedicine consultations retention remains challenging, and aspects around the associated experiences and outcomes remain unclear. The need to further investigate these aspects was a motivating factor for conducting this scoping review.
Objective
With a focus on synchronous telemedicine consultations between patients with nonmalignant chronic illnesses and health care professionals (HCPs), this scoping review aimed to gain insights into (1) the available evidence on telemedicine consultations to improve health outcomes for patients, (2) the associated behaviors and attitudes of patients and HCPs, and (3) how supplemental technology can assist in remote consultations.
Methods
PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guided the scoping review process. Inclusion criteria were (1) involving adults with nonmalignant, noncommunicable chronic conditions as the study population; (2) focusing on health outcomes and experiences of and attitudes toward synchronous telemedicine consultations between patients and HCPs; and (3) conducting empirical research. A search strategy was applied to PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL Complete, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM Digital. Screening of articles and data extraction from included articles were performed in parallel and independently by 2 researchers, who corroborated their findings and resolved any conflicts.
Results
Overall, 4167 unique articles were identified from the databases searched. Following multilayer filtration, 19 (0.46%) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for data extraction. They investigated 6 nonmalignant chronic conditions, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, and the telemedicine consultation modality varied in each case. Most observed positive health outcomes for patients with chronic conditions using telemedicine consultations. Patients generally favored the modality’s convenience, but concerns were highlighted around cost, practical logistics, and thoroughness of clinical examinations. The majority of HCPs were also in favor of the technology, but a minority experienced reduced job satisfaction. Supplemental technological assistance was identified in relation to technical considerations, improved remote workflow, and training in remote care use.
Conclusions
For patients with noncommunicable chronic conditions, telemedicine consultations are generally associated with positive health outcomes that are either directly or indirectly related to their ailment, but sustained improvements remain unclear. These modalities also indicate the potential to empower such patients to better manage their condition. HCPs and patients tend to be satisfied with remote care experience, and most are receptive to the modality as an option. Assistance from supplemental technologies mostly resides in addressing technical issues, and additional modules could be integrated to address challenges relevant to patients and HCPs. However, positive outcomes and attitudes toward the modality might not apply to all cases, indicating that telemedicine consultations are more appropriate as options rather than replacements of in-person visits.}

abstract = {Air Traffic Management aims at ensuring safety during aircraft operations, particularly within Terminal Manoeuvring Areas where traffic density is high. The challenge lies in balancing safety and efficiency by closely managing the likelihood of mid-air collisions regarding the airport movements. Traditional models like the Reich and Anderson-Hsu models have been influential, but they fall short in representing the complex reality of Terminal Manoeuvring Areas. Data-driven approaches are emerging, with Monte Carlo simulations offering a more flexible methodology for collision risk estimation. This paper introduces a framework for assessing Mid-Air Collision likelihood resulting from Terminal Manoeuvring Area procedures by combining the field of Deep Generative Modelling using a Variational Autoencoder with the domain of rare event statistics through Subset Simulation. By incorporating disentanglement into the Variational Autoencoders model, we create a latent space that aligns dimensions with distinctive trajectory traits. Then, Subset Simulation is employed to gauge Mid-Air Collision probability, utilizing latent representations as input. Finally, sensitivity analysis reveals pivotal factors influencing collision risk, correlated with trajectory attributes via disentanglement. The methodology is applied to traffic around Zurich Airport: it evaluates the risk arising from go-around and take-off procedures using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast data.}

abstract = {The Gut Microbiome-Liver-Brain Axis is a relatively novel construct with promising potential to enhance our understanding of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and its therapeutic approaches. Significant alterations in the gut microbiome occur in AUD even before any other systemic signs or symptoms manifest. Prolonged and inappropriate alcohol consumption, by affecting the gut microbiota and gut mucosa permeability, is thought to contribute to the development of behavioral and cognitive impairments, leading to Alcohol-Related Liver Disorders and potentially progressing into alcoholic cirrhosis, which is often associated with severe cognitive impairment related to neurodegeneration, such as hepatic encephalopathy and alcoholic dementia. The critical role of the gut microbiota is further supported by the efficacy of FDA-approved treatments for hepatic encephalopathy in alcoholic cirrhosis (i.e., lactulose and rifaximin). To stimulate new research, we hypothesize that interactions between a maladaptive stress response and a constitutional predisposition to neurodegeneration underlie the progression of AUD to conditions of Alcohol-Related Clinical Concerns with severe cognitive impairment, which represent a significant and costly burden to society. Early identification of AUD individuals at risk for developing these conditions could help to prioritize integrated therapeutic interventions targeting different substrates of the Gut Microbiome-Liver-Brain axis. Specifically, addiction medications, microbiome modulators, stress-reducing interventions, and, possibly soon, novel agents that reduce hepatic steatosis/fibrosis will be discussed in the context of digitally supported integrated therapeutic approaches. The explicit goal of this AUD treatment performed on the early stage of the disorder would be to reduce the transition from AUD to those conditions of Alcohol-Related Common Clinical Concerns associated with severe cognitive impairment, a strategy recommended for most neurological neurodegenerative disorders.}
