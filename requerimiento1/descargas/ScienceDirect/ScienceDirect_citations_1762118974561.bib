Resecting liver surgery has been dominated by open surgical approaches (OLR). Minimal invasive procedures such as robotic liver surgery (RLR) are technically challenging but may reduce the surgical trauma and complication rates.
Objectives & methods
This study aims to compare the outcomes of RLR and OLR. A retrospective, single-centre analysis was conducted on 185 patients who underwent liver resection for benign or malign diseases (OLR: 86, RLR: 99). The primary objective was complication rates based on Clavien-Dindo classification, Secondary objectives included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and resection outcomes.
Results
RLR was associated with significantly less major complications (23.1 % vs. 41.9 %, p = 0.011), lower blood loss (200 ml vs. 400 ml, p = 0.013) and shorter hospital stays (9.0 vs. 13.0 days, p < 0.001). Primary oncological results were similar.
Conclusion
RLR provides equivalent resection quality to OLR, with fewer complications, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays.}

abstract = {Background
Empathy is a cornerstone of interpersonal and emotional health, yet its measurement often conflates self-oriented sympathetic responses with other-oriented empathy. To measure other-oriented empathy in its interpersonal manifestation, the Self-Effacing Empathy Scale (SEES) was examined for its validity and reliability among adolescents and their parents.
Method
Adolescents and their parents, resident in South Africa were recruited through social media. Hundred and twelve participants completed a composite questionnaire that comprised the SEES, Basic Empathy Scale (BES), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Vigour Assessment Scale (VAS). A replicative data set comprising the same measures was collected eight weeks later from the same participants.
Results
Convergent validity of the SEES was found in it correlating strongly in the initial data set with the BES (r = 0.639) and moderately with the other-oriented items of the IRI (r = 0.528), and strongly in the replicative data set (r = 0.884; r = 0.771). Discriminant validity was found in its weak correlation with the VAS (r = 0.326) in the initial data set. Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated good (0.697) and excellent (0.940) internal consistency. The SEES incurred a small standard error of measurement, whereby the total scores were differing at most between 2.34 and 2.49 from the true values over 72 theoretically possible scores. A three-factor model indicated structural reliability, accounting for 46.3 % and 64.8 % of the cumulative variance in the respective data sets.
Conclusions
The SEES provides a valid and reliable measure for investigating associations between health and self-effacing empathy, and effects of interventions on it.}

abstract = {Background
Digestive system perforations after anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS), if left untreated, are life-threatening. These injuries are often categorized as pharyngoesophageal. Although the pharynx and esophagus are continuations of each other, they are two distinct anatomical structures. There is limited experience in managing patients with pharyngeal injuries after ACSS.
Methods
Using PRISMA guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted on the iatrogenic pharyngeal perforations after ACSS for the treatment of disc herniation and degenerative cervical myeloradiculopathy.
Results
A total of 12 patients met our inclusion criteria. Eleven were from published studies, and one was our patient (2 female and 10 male, mean age = 56.25 years, range: 31–82 years). Clinical symptoms of patients with iatrogenic pharyngeal perforation after ACSS varied depending on whether the cases present early or late after surgery. Although clinical symptoms suggested a pharynx or esophageal injury, definitive diagnosis was challenging. All cases diagnosed either early or late after ACSS underwent surgical repair treatment, except for one case managed conservatively with antibiotics and nasogastric feeding. The overall outcome was favorable for all patients. However, the postoperative follow-up duration was not specified in two cases. In the remaining 10 cases, postoperative follow-up durations were generally short and varied significantly (mean = 4.87 months, median = 1.75 months, range:1 week–24 months).
Conclusion
Iatrogenic pharyngeal injuries resulting from ACSS are extremely rare. They are relatively straightforward to diagnose and can be managed with a multidisciplinary approach. However, their long-term prognosis remains unknown.}

keywords = {natural language processing, depression, anxiety, systematic review, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
The introduction of natural language processing (NLP) technologies has significantly enhanced the potential of self-administered interventions for treating anxiety and depression by improving human-computer interactions. Although these advances, particularly in complex models such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), are highly promising, robust evidence validating the effectiveness of the interventions remains sparse.
Objective
The aim of this study was to determine whether self-administered interventions based on NLP models can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to November 3, 2023. We included studies with participants of any age diagnosed with depression or anxiety through professional consultation or validated psychometric instruments. Interventions had to be self-administered and based on NLP models, with passive or active comparators. Outcomes measured included depressive and anxiety symptom scores. We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies but excluded narrative, systematic, and scoping reviews. Data extraction was performed independently by pairs of authors using a predefined form. Meta-analysis was conducted using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and random effects models to account for heterogeneity.
Results
In all, 21 articles were selected for review, of which 76% (16/21) were included in the meta-analysis for each outcome. Most of the studies (16/21, 76%) were recent (2020-2023), with interventions being mostly AI-based NLP models (11/21, 52%); most (19/21, 90%) delivered some form of therapy (primarily cognitive behavioral therapy: 16/19, 84%). The overall meta-analysis showed that self-administered interventions based on NLP models were significantly more effective in reducing both depressive (SMD 0.819, 95% CI 0.389-1.250; P<.001) and anxiety (SMD 0.272, 95% CI 0.116-0.428; P=.001) symptoms compared to various control conditions. Subgroup analysis indicated that AI-based NLP models were effective in reducing depressive symptoms (SMD 0.821, 95% CI 0.207-1.436; P<.001) compared to pooled control conditions. Rule-based NLP models showed effectiveness in reducing both depressive (SMD 0.854, 95% CI 0.172-1.537; P=.01) and anxiety (SMD 0.347, 95% CI 0.116-0.578; P=.003) symptoms. The meta-regression showed no significant association between participants’ mean age and treatment outcomes (all P>.05). Although the findings were positive, the overall certainty of evidence was very low, mainly due to a high risk of bias, heterogeneity, and potential publication bias.
Conclusions
Our findings support the effectiveness of self-administered NLP-based interventions in alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms, highlighting their potential to increase accessibility to, and reduce costs in, mental health care. Although the results were encouraging, the certainty of evidence was low, underscoring the need for further high-quality randomized controlled trials and studies examining implementation and usability. These interventions could become valuable components of public health strategies to address mental health issues.

In this research, we present a Visual Co-Alignment (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieved 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALLE⋅3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL⋅E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

Using three-wave data collection, the focus was on how GenAI influences four key motivational constructs: autonomy, competence, relatedness, and identified regulation, and the developmental trajectory of motivation over time. Results from mixed-effects modeling reveal significant time and group interactions, demonstrating that GenAI use leads to substantial motivational gains over time. The results from Gradient Boosting Machine for Time Series (GBMT) indicated that the EFL learners’ motivation development follows curvilinear trajectories, characterized by rapid initial growth that gradually plateaus. Theoretically, the findings extend SDT’s application to AI-mediated learning by demonstrating how GenAI scaffolds psychological needs: fostering competence through adaptive feedback, autonomy via personalized support, and relatedness and identified regulation through simulated social interaction. The study contributes to emerging discourse on technology-enhanced motivation while highlighting the need for proficiency-sensitive implementation strategies in EFL writing contexts.}

abstract = {This paper examines the epistemological challenges arising from the integration of data-intensive methods in tourism research. By focusing on the tensions between traditional theory-driven approaches, and the incorporation of data-driven and model-driven methods, this conceptual study explores how the growing popularity of data influences theory development and the generalisability of findings. Furthermore, this paper outlines a conceptual framework that integrates data-driven and model-driven approaches with tourism research. Rather than presenting a fully elaborated model, it offers guiding dimensions to help researchers navigate data-intensive studies while maintaining scientific rigor and ethical integrity. Emphasising the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of flexible theoretical constructs, this study advocates for a balanced approach that merges domain knowledge with data exploration to ensure robust applications in this rapidly evolving landscape.}

abstract = {With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in the realms of creativity and design is becoming increasingly prevalent. This paper seeks to explore a comparative study between AIGC-assisted and traditional methods in automotive seat design. The design of automotive seats is a complex process that integrates considerations of ergonomics, material science, safety, and comfort. Traditional design approaches rely on the experience of designers and preliminary user research to iteratively refine design solutions, a process that is time-consuming and contingent upon the skill level of the designers. By utilizing the Pole Position (ABE) automotive seat design project as a case study and employing the SWOT analysis model, this research compares traditional design methods with those augmented by AIGC. The findings indicate that AIGC-assisted design excels in reducing design timeframes, enhancing design diversity, and increasing user satisfaction. However, traditional methods still hold an edge in deeply understanding and integrating user needs to achieve emotional design. Consequently, this study recommends integration of AIGC-assisted with traditional design approaches, leveraging the strengths of AI to supplement the deficiencies of conventional methods, and harnessing the creative thinking of designers to realize more humanized and personalized automotive seat designs.}

abstract = {Background
Parents commonly use the internet to research their child's diagnosis, read provider reviews, and find additional resources like support groups before or after a clinic visit. This study aimed to characterize demographic and diagnosis-specific variables associated with more frequent internet-based research prior to initial outpatient evaluation.
Methods
Parents of children presenting to an outpatient orthopaedic clinic completed a survey reporting their history of internet use in preparation for the initial visit. Data on demographics, diagnosis, and types of websites used were collected and analyzed. Predictors of parental previsit internet research were determined. Groups were assessed for differences in internet usage using Pearson's chi-square and Cochran-Armitage trend tests.
Results
Of 514 completed surveys, 179 (34.8%) parents reported internet use to prepare for the initial clinic visit. Internet use was more common among parents of patients with congenital or syndromic conditions (ie clubfoot or cerebral palsy) (19/30, [63.3%]) compared to spine (28/71, [39.4%]), nonspecific, (musculoskeletal pain) (28/81, [34.6%]), traumatic (fractures, and sport injuries) (72/226 [31.9%]), or non-congenital extremity (toe walking, intoeing, bow legs) (32/106, [30.2%]) concerns (P = .010). Internet use was more common in patients with household income ≥$50,000 (109/242, [45.0%]) compared to lower income (60/209, [28.7%]) and nondisclosed income (10/63, [15.9%]) (P < .001). Among 484 subjects disclosing education level, higher internet-usage rates were associated with more education; 22.6% (30/133) for high-school graduates or less, 36.0% (67/186) for some college, and 43.0% (71/165) for college graduates or more (trend P < .001). Search engines were used most frequently (175/179, [97.8%]), followed by hospital websites (52/179, [29.1%]), social media (31/179, [17.3%]), and medical information sites (28/179, [15.6%]). Few patients (2/179, [1.1%]) utilized medical society sites like Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) or OrthoKids.org.
Conclusion
Parents of children with congenital or syndromic conditions were more likely to research their child's condition online before seeing an orthopaedic surgeon. Higher education and household income were linearly associated with previsit internet research.
Key Concepts
(1)About 34.8% of surveyed parents used the internet before their child's clinic visit, with higher usage observed among those with higher educational and socioeconomic status, and for more complex or chronic medical conditions.(2)Parents of children with congenital or syndromic conditions (eg clubfoot, developmental dysplasia of the hip) are significantly more likely to utilize internet resources prior to visits (63%) compared to other diagnoses, with trauma-related visits showing much lower rates.(3)Search engines are the most commonly used online resource, followed by hospital or specialty websites and social media, with Facebook being particularly significant among parents of children with congenital or syndromic diagnoses.(4)Disparities in education and income limit access to online health information, reinforcing inequity and highlighting the need for accessible, high-quality resources and clinician awareness.

This study explores the opinions and concerns of international IA experts regarding how ChatGPT may change the future of IA in terms of the benefits and threats it may pose to IA. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with IA experts including consultants, regulators, and academics. The majority of the interviewees were of the view that ChatGPT will help reduce the time and effort required for preliminary data collection and will improve the report quality in terms of formatting and sentence structure etc. However, a number of interviewees also feared that the quality of data in reports and public involvement in IA process may be compromised, chances of plagiarism and bias may increase, and the quality of IA graduates produced by academic institutions may deteriorate. The majority of the experts were afraid that ChatGPT will pose more threats to IA compared to the benefits it may offer. The policymakers, while keeping all these concerns in mind, need to formulate laws, rules, and guidelines regarding the use of ChatGPT in IA in their respective areas as suggested by the interviewees. Future studies may be conducted to evaluate and compare the use of different types of chatbots such as Google’s Bard or Microsoft’s Bing in IA. Additionally, AI related laws and guidelines drafted by IA systems across the globe and their implementation may be evaluated a couple of years later.}

By constructing multi-dimensional building performance index system, combining data dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping technology, the problem of index homogeneity and parameter convergence in traditional evaluation is solved. Through experiments, it is found that the average evaluation accuracy of ACO-RBF and GRA-RBF models is 87.48% and 86.60% respectively, while the fusion model in this paper achieves a performance improvement with an accuracy of 93.31%. The model adopts a three-stage collaborative mechanism -- feature space reconstruction, parameter global optimization and nonlinear decision mapping. It significantly improves the objectivity and reliability of complex building performance evaluation, provides a verifiable technical framework for intelligence-driven design decisions, and promotes the transformation of architectural design scheme evaluation from an experience-dependent paradigm to a data-driven paradigm.}

Bladder carcinoma encompasses various histological subtypes, with shadow cell differentiation (SCD) being an exceptionally rare occurrence, resembling cutaneous pilomatricoma. Herein, we report a case of bladder carcinoma with SCD and aim to elucidate its clinico-pathological characteristics.
Case presentation
A 67-year-old North African man, a heavy smoker, who presented with left lumbar pain, haematuria and dysuria. The physical examination revealed a hypogastric mass. Rectal examination was unremarkable. Radiological examination (Ultrasound and CT) showed a 3 cm bladder tumor, with a suspicious lung and mediastinal tumors. A complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) was performed. It showed high-grade urothelial carcinoma with partial squamous differentiation and SCD. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive β-catenin in the peripheral squamous component.
Clinical discussion
Our findings highlight that SCD, a form of keratinization typically observed in the hair matrix, can also manifest in carcinomas with squamous components. The presence of SCD in these tumors suggests a variant of keratinization potentially linked to the squamous components within these neoplasms.
Conclusion
We presented a case bladder carcinoma with SCD, underscoring its unique histopathological features and the importance of recognizing this rare variant for accurate diagnosis and management.}

To assess the feasibility and utility of a text-to-image artificial intelligence (AI) model in enhancing patient counseling on the cosmetic side effects of prostaglandin analogue (PGA) therapy.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
Pre- and post-treatment periocular photographs of PGA-treated patients were collected. To simulate bilateral pre-treatment appearance, untreated eyes were mirrored. The Generative Fill feature powered by Adobe Firefly was applied to masked orbital regions, using descriptive text prompts to generate visualizations of prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy (PAP), including upper eyelid ptosis, enophthalmos, and hypertrichosis. Prompts were iteratively refined to closely replicate known treatment-related changes.
Results
The AI model successfully produced visually realistic images within two minutes that closely resembled the actual post-treatment appearance of PAP. Key manifestations such as eyelash hypertrichosis, enophthalmos, deepened upper lid sulcus, and ptosis were effectively simulated using tailored prompts.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that text-to-image AI may serve as a novel, rapid, and personalized tool for visualizing potential cosmetic side effects of PGA therapy. By enabling patients to preview changes on their own faces, this technology may enhance informed consent, set realistic expectations, and improve treatment adherence. Future research should evaluate patient perceptions, the accuracy of AI-generated outcomes, and integration into clinical workflows.}

Barriers to improving outcomes after AKI include limited recognition of AKI by providers, the required transitions of care from the inpatient and outpatient settings, and lack of patient awareness of the AKI event. Gaps in the care of AKI survivors may be improved with enhanced education for providers and patients. Some tools focused on early detection of AKI and improving AKI management have been developed with variable success in addressing adverse outcomes. Significant heterogeneity within the AKI population and complexities of care coordination continue to hinder programs focused on improving AKI survivorship. On the horizon, promising programs are emerging that may overcome these barriers by offering an individualized, patient-centered approach to AKI survivorship by integrating technological advances and multidisciplinary support. Greater emphasis is being placed on ensuring that tactics for AKI management can be implemented beyond the nephrology subspecialty. These programs can potentially prevent AKI, optimize recovery, and increase patient satisfaction.

abstract = {Introduction
Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) affects almost half of patients with chronic hemodialysis. ACKD is recognized as a predisposing condition for renal carcinoma, particularly in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. Acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (ACD-RCC) is a subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurring solely in patients with ACKD. ACD-RCC was first introduced as a distinct entity in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of renal tumors and retained in the 2022 update. However, it remains underdiagnosed due to histologic overlap with other subtypes. We aimed to study the clinicopathological features of the entity.
Case presentation
We reported the case of a 44-year-old patient who presented a hemorrhagic shock of suspected renal origin. A scan showed no renal tumor. The patient experienced a second episode of hemorrhagic shock. A hemostatic nephrectomy was necessary. Microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of ACD-RCC. The patient died three days post-operatively.
Clinical discussion
ACD-RCC is a common but under recognized entity with specific clinical, histopathological, and evolutionary features.
Conclusion
Enhanced recognition of ACD-RCC and its features by pathologists is mandatory to ensure accurate histopathological diagnosis and appropriate clinical management.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Native American (American Indian/Alaska Native) youth have the highest rates of suicide and suicide clusters in the United States, and appropriate responses are lacking. This study examined protective and risk factors for suicide in a remote Northern Plains reservation with a recent cluster.
Methods
A mixed-methods study was conducted on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Montana, in 2022 using a community-engaged approach. Quantitative results from the 251-item questionnaire are presented, which were derived from a culturally adapted socio-ecological model. Aaniiih and Nakoda youth 14–24 years of age, living on/near Fort Belknap were recruited.
Findings
In total, 197 youth completed the questionnaire; average age was 16.6 years (SD = 2.60). One hundred (51%) youth were female and 90 (46%) male; 6.1% of data points were missing. Positive family relationships, communal mastery, benevolent childhood experiences, and emotional intelligence were protective, decreasing odds of suicide ideation. Childhood and family risk factors correlated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, including verbal abuse, low community support, sexual abuse, and witnessing community violence. Utilizing multivariable modeling, emotional intelligence (protective factor), and early initiation of substance use, verbal abuse, PTSD, and historical losses (risk factors) were significant factors for suicide ideation, when controlling for all other factors.
Interpretation
Adverse childhood experiences, early initiation of substance use, and PTSD increase suicide ideation and attempts. When youth experience positive and supportive family relationships, odds of suicide ideation are lower, which highlight pivotal areas for intervention and response.

This technological shift allows pathologists to analyze tissue morphology digitally, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. Recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled research in digital pathology, with applications such as tumor detection, tissue segmentation, and telemedicine consultations. Despite the promising outlook, challenges remain, especially in managing the vast volume and complexity of WSI data. Information retrieval (IR) systems, which have long facilitated the structured search of clinical data, are increasingly relevant in this context, particularly for image-based searches like Content-based image retrieval. IR systems, including both text and image searches, enable rapid access to patient information and disease patterns, significantly supporting diagnostic workflows and personalized treatment. The emergence of large deep models and foundation models further complements traditional IR systems, offering new frameworks for integrating AI-driven insights with efficient information access. However, the synergy between AI models and conventional IR approaches is essential to ensure transparency, accuracy, and clinical utility in digital pathology.}

abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing inpatient allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) often experience psychological consequences. care.coach AvatarTM is a tablet-based ‘human-in-the-loop’ virtual health assistant (VHA) that uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) to provide psychosocial support. It has improved loneliness, depression, anxiety, hospital delirium, and falls in older adults in the hospital (Bott, J Med Internet Res 2019).
Methods
We adapted the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT. The VHA engages patients with reminders for hydration, medications, food, or activity; HCT education modules; playing games; playing the news or music; having free-form conversations; going through therapeutic activities and exercises; and practicing mindfulness and guided meditation. Avatar protocols were updated based on feedback from a structured focus group (n=10) of nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. 7 HCT-specific educational modules were created. A feasibility pilot was performed in 3 sequential cohorts of 6 patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. In the first cohort, patients were given the VHAs without any recommendations for how long to use them. The second cohort was given a recommendation for 30 minutes per day, and the third cohort was offered a $20 gift card for completion of at least 4 modules. Responses were measured through patient surveys and engagement data analysis. Predefined retention rate for feasibility was 67%, a standard for introduction of a novel AI technology (Teresi, Med Care 2022). Dissatisfaction rate for the overall VHA experience was defined as responding “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with recommending the VHA to others.
Results
The study included 18 patients (Table). Retention rate from enrollment to discharge or three weeks (whichever came first) was 78% (95% CI: 52-94%). A post-pilot survey was completed by 16 patients (90%), revealing a dissatisfaction rate of 28%. Dissatisfaction rates decreased from 50% to 20% to 0% across the 3 cohorts. Frequency of completion of the post-pilot survey for the full study was 72% within 1 week of disenrollment, and 90% overall. Average completion rate was 52% for all seven HCT modules in the whole study population. Across cohorts, module completion rates changed from 5% to 88% to 62%, reflecting guidance to patients. VHA functions by most time of usage were music (35%), exercise (20%), and education (15%; Figure).
Conclusions
The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT patients. Despite modest dissatisfaction and variability in completion rates, the VHA showed promise in providing HCT education, social, and emotional support for inpatient RIC HCT. Further research is needed, including the potential application for outpatient HCT.}

keywords = {vaping, social media, Mexican American, college students, marketing, acculturation, protocol, artificial intelligence},
abstract = {Background
The tobacco industry has a history of targeting minority communities, including Hispanic individuals, by promoting vaping through social media. This marketing increases the risk of vaping among Hispanic young adults, including college students. In Texas, college enrollment among Mexican Americans has significantly increased over recent years. However, little research exists on the link between social media and vaping and the underlying mechanisms (ie, outcome expectations, attitudes, and beliefs) explaining how vaping-related social media impacts vaping among Mexican American college students. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about how acculturation moderates the association between social media and vaping. Hispanic individuals, particularly Mexican Americans, are the largest ethnic group in Texas colleges; thus, it is crucial to understand the impact of social media and acculturation on their vaping behaviors.
Objective
We outline the mixed methods used in Project Vaping, Acculturation, and Media Study (VAMoS). We present descriptive analyses of the participants enrolled in the study, highlight methodological strengths, and discuss lessons learned during the implementation of the study protocol related to recruitment and data collection and management.
Methods
Project VAMoS is being conducted with Mexican American students attending 1 of 6 Texas-based colleges: University of Texas (UT) Arlington, UT Dallas, UT El Paso, UT Rio Grande Valley, UT San Antonio, and the University of Houston System. This project has 2 phases. Phase 1 included an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study and qualitative one-on-one interviews (years 1-2), and phase 2 includes cognitive interviews and a 4-wave web-based survey study (years 2-4) with objective assessments of vaping-related social media content to which participants are exposed. Descriptive statistics summarized participants’ characteristics in the EMA and web-based survey.
Results
The EMA analytic sample comprised 51 participants who were primarily female (n=37, 73%), born in the United States (n=48, 94%), of middle socioeconomic status (n=38, 75%), and aged 21 years on average (SD 1.7 years). The web-based survey cohort comprised 1492 participants self-identifying as Mexican American; Tejano, Tejana, or Tejanx; or Chicano, Chicana, or Chicanx heritage who were primarily female (n=1042, 69.8%), born in the United States (n=1366, 91.6%), of middle socioeconomic status (n=1174, 78.7%), and aged 20.1 years on average at baseline (SD 2.2 years). Of the baseline cohort, the retention rate in wave 2 was 74.7% (1114/1492).
Conclusions
Project VAMoS is one of the first longitudinal mixed methods studies exploring the impact of social media and acculturation on vaping behaviors specifically targeting Mexican American college students. Its innovative approach to objectively measuring social media exposure and engagement related to vaping enhances the validity of self-reported data beyond what national surveys can achieve. The results can be used to develop evidence-based, culturally relevant interventions to prevent vaping among this rapidly growing minority population.

The acute pleural empyema guidelines recommend thoracoscopic-assisted surgery. However, there is no clear guideline for chest tube removal after surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the duration from surgery to chest tube removal, identify associated factors.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 95 patients having non-fistulous empyema due to pulmonary infection caused by common bacteria who underwent surgery at our hospital from January 2011 to March 2023. Postoperative lavage was conducted until two consecutive pleural fluid cultures were negative. The chest tube was clamped and removed if there was no exacerbation of fever or inflammatory findings for 2 days.
Results
Seventy-eight patients (82.1%) were men with a mean age of 72 years. The median duration from surgery to chest tube removal was 14 (interquartile range: 8–22) days. In the multivariable analysis, the independent factors associated with the duration from surgery to chest tube removal were lower prognostic nutritional index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.753; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.101–2.792; P = 0.018) and positive preoperative pleural fluid culture (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.069–3.261; P = 0.028). Ninety-two (96.8%) patients did not require additional treatment or rehospitalization.
Conclusions
Positive preoperative pleural fluid culture and nutritional status were significant independent factors associated with the duration from surgery to chest tube removal. Almost all patients did not require chest tube reinsertion in our approach. These findings using our approach may guide optimal management of chest tube removal in non-fistulous empyema.}

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions have been acknowledged as effective strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the accessibility of conventional face-to-face interventions is often limited. Digital health intervention has been suggested as a potential solution to overcome the limitation. Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding the effectiveness of digital health for individuals with prediabetes, particularly in reducing T2DM incidence and reverting to normoglycemia.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of different intervention modes of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions, particularly the benefits of digital health intervention, in reducing T2DM incidence and facilitating the reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes compared to the usual care.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search in 9 electronic databases, namely MEDLINE, Embase, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, and NHS Economic Evaluation Database through Ovid, from the inception to October 2024. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in adults with prediabetes. The overall intervention effect was synthesized using a random-effects model. The I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity across the RCTs. We performed a subgroup analysis to explore the effectiveness of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions compared with the control group, which received usual care.
Results
From an initial 7868 records retrieved from 9 databases, we identified 54 articles from 31 RCTs. Our analysis showed that face-to-face interventions demonstrated a significant 46% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (risk ratio [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.47-0.63; I²=43%; P<.001), and a 46% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.91; I²=82%; P=.006), when compared with the control group. On the other hand, digital health interventions, compared with the control group, were associated with a 12% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01; I²=0.6%; P=.06). Moreover, the blended interventions combining digital and face-to-face interventions suggested a 37% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81;I²<0.01%; P<.001) and an 87% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.30-2.69; I²=23%; P=.001). However, no significant effect on the reversal of prediabetes to normoglycemia was observed from the digital health interventions.
Conclusions
Face-to-face interventions have consistently demonstrated promising effectiveness in both reductions in T2DM incidence and reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes. However, the effectiveness of digital health interventions in these areas has not been sufficiently proven. Given these results, further research is required to provide more definitive evidence of digital health and blended interventions in T2DM prevention in the future.

abstract = {Objectives
Most adult patients in England now have access to their primary care electronic health record (EHR), including free-text consultation notes, via the NHS App or other online services. As EHRs were not designed for patient audiences, this study aimed to explore patients’ and carers’ perspectives and understanding of simulated consultation notes.
Methods
One interview and five focus groups were conducted with 26 patients and carers from a purposive sample of underserved communities in England between April and May 2023. Participants’ understanding and views were elicited regarding five vignettes about patient consultation scenarios and corresponding simulated primary care EHR entries. Verbatim transcripts were analysed inductively using thematic analysis.
Results
Most participants struggled to fully understand the simulated consultation notes, particularly medical acronyms, clinician shorthand and non-clinical abbreviations. Participants also identified issues which may cause unintended offence or anxiety, and made suggestions about how EHRs may be improved to meet the needs of patient audiences and maintain positive patient-clinician relationships.
Conclusions
Opening up online record access to include patient audiences necessitates a significant cultural shift in the way that consultation notes are written and used. Participants proposed technological and documentation adaptations to enhance understanding, support diverse patient needs and maintain positive patient-clinician relationships.
Practice implications
To fully realise the benefits of patient online records access, it is important for consultation notes to be written in a way that patients find meaningful, while maintaining their clinical integrity. To optimise NHS England’s investment in this policy and avoid exacerbating health inequalities, it is essential to ensure all patients can access the benefits of online access to their EHR. Healthcare professionals need to be supported to manage the challenges of writing consultation notes for patient audiences, while continuing to maintain effective clinical care.}

This article outlines the process of creating a more efficient battery pack by focusing on improving material and energy use during production and end-of-life, through a Lean-based tool. The aim is to reduce impacts across the battery pack’s lifecycle, following the eco-design practices and standards by enhancing the durability of materials and components and simplifying their recovery and recycling. The improvements are being carried out within the scope of a European Project, which aims to enhance the durability of materials and components and make it easier to recover and recycle them. The Lean Design-for-eXcellence methodology was used to identify areas for potential improvement in the pack’s design, namely considering Design-for-Manufacturing, Design-for-Second Life, and Design-for-Recyclability. The results show potential opportunities to improve the efficiency of control, safety, mechanical, and electrical systems across different domains. Key areas for improvement that could significantly enhance overall system sustainability performance include reducing weight, optimizing coolant flow, and expediting disassembly and assembly processes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Foregut duplication cysts are rare mediastinal malformations that can cause life-threatening respiratory compromise in early infancy and are often misdiagnosed on initial imaging.
Presentation of case
A three-month-old boy, born at 37 weeks, developed progressive respiratory distress and cyanosis unresponsive to pneumonia therapy. Chest radiography suggested a hiatal hernia, whereas thoracic ultrasound showed a multiloculated cyst. Contrast-enhanced CT delineated a thick-walled paracardial cyst crossing the diaphragm and a smaller posterior chest-wall cyst. On hospital day 8 a right thoraco-abdominal approach allowed en-bloc removal of the 6 × 4 cm lesion with mucosectomy of the adherent esophageal segment and excision of the posterior cyst. Histology confirmed gastric-type foregut duplication. The infant was extubated on postoperative day 1, reached full feeds by day 7, and was discharged asymptomatic on day 18.
Discussion
This case illustrates the diagnostic pitfalls of mediastinal foregut duplication cysts masquerading as more common entities such as hiatal hernia. Multimodal imaging—particularly ultrasound and CT—was pivotal in defining lesion extent and guiding timely surgery. Complete thoraco-abdominal excision achieved rapid recovery and mitigated risks of infection, hemorrhage, or malignant transformation reported with incomplete resection.
Conclusion
Neonates with unexplained respiratory distress and mediastinal masses should prompt consideration of foregut duplication cysts. Early cross-sectional imaging and definitive surgical excision are essential for preventing complications and ensuring excellent long-term outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is a major cause of disability globally. Due to the multifactorial nature of CNSLBP, non-pharmacological management such as exercise therapy, has been recommended as a first-line treatment. This pilot study examined the acceptability and clinical impact of a novel physiotherapist-led movement-based intervention for people with CNSLBP.
Methods
A mixed-methods study design was used. Twenty-nine adults with CNSLBP were allocated to a 12-week movement-based program (Motum) or waitlist control. The intervention comprised 12 sessions based on fundamental movement patterns and motor control principles. The primary outcome was acceptability and secondary measures were balance, pain, function, self-efficacy and kinesiophobia. Semi-structured interviews explored participants experiences of the intervention.
Results
The intervention was acceptable to participants with all sub-domains (affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, self-efficacy, and ethicality) scoring ‘highly acceptable’ (p < .001), except burden which scored ‘acceptable’ (p < .02). The intervention demonstrated large positive changes for improving fear avoidance of movement (Hedges g = .92) and balance (g = 1.04) and smaller positive effects on pain and function (g = .62) and self-efficacy (g = .23), compared to controls. Themes emerging from qualitative data with 10 participants were: 1) acceptability of program structure; 2) positive impacts attributed to the intervention; and 3) barriers to engagement.
Conclusion
Motum was an acceptable intervention and demonstrated positive impacts across a range of clinical outcomes. While these findings are encouraging, further research through mature study designs (such as randomised controlled trials) are required to substantiate these findings.}

abstract = {In this review, I show how Generative AI (GAI) utterly transforms how we represent, access, expose and cover, find and lose, sanitise and toxify, use and abuse, and communicate with, the past. The term ‘collective memory’ has become common parlance for an array of constructive and nefarious uses of the shared past. It is often seen as related to the lifespan of an individual, or a group or generation who lived through or experienced a particular era or event, affording some kind of shared experience that is strengthened by the presence of or connection to others in common. In this way, the collective, as with an individual's memory has its limits, it dies out. However, particularly since the late twentieth century, the term has acquired a mythical form, with publics, institutions and scholars, imagining in its nature, function and extended duration, for a variety of ends. These imaginaries are often tied to assumptions around the unifying nature of the technologies and media of memory of the day. I argue here that today's agentic turn by contrast offers no such prospects for collective memory, mythical or otherwise. Rather, Generative and Agentic AI's extracting, remixing and replaying of interactions, shards you and your identities anew, rendering it difficult to imagine a group, experience or event, around which a collective memory could cohere. Instead, individuals and societies are subject to a black box memory of impossible provenance, where human agency in shaping what the past becomes is in retreat.}

abstract = {This study presents PuppyCodeReview, an AI-based system designed to support code review activities in programming education. While peer code review is increasingly emphasized in computer science curricula, its effectiveness in university classrooms remains uncertain, especially among novice programmers. PuppyCodeReview aims to address this gap by automating the review process and providing structured feedback on design, functionality, complexity, and common code smells. To evaluate the system’s impact, a four-week experiment was conducted in a data structures course at a university in Taiwan. Students were divided into control and experimental groups; the control group used a standard web interface, while the experimental group utilized the AI-assisted PuppyCodeReview system for the same tasks. Cognitive load was measured before and after the intervention. Results indicated that although cognitive load increased in both groups, the increase was significantly smaller for students using PuppyCodeReview, suggesting the system reduced mental effort associated with code review. These findings highlight the potential of AI-assisted tools in making peer review more accessible and pedagogically effective for novice programmers.}
