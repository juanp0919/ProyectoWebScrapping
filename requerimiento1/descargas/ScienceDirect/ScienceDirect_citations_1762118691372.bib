abstract = {In light of the rapid and unpredictable developments in artificial intelligence (AI), there is a growing need for innovative marketing strategies that can expand market reach and effectively promote services. AI and social interaction have emerged as powerful tools in modern marketing, particularly through the use of social media platforms to enhance product awareness and drive customer engagement. This study investigates the factors influencing customer decision-making in relation to participation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based marketing. Drawing on prior research in the field, the study introduces a conceptual model incorporating key variables such as age, Internet usage, information quality, and information credibility. To examine the proposed model, a questionnaire was administered to students from universities in Tehran. The collected data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The findings reveal that customer satisfaction and customer inertia significantly influence customer decisions to engage in smart marketing practices. Among the evaluated variables, information quality was identified as the most impactful factor, while Internet usage had the least influence. These results provide practical insights for marketers and researchers aiming to leverage GAI in customer-oriented strategies.}

However, previous AI literacy frameworks may inadequately reflect specific competencies necessary for proficient GenAI use. To address this gap, this study aimed to conceptualise a GenAI specific literacy framework tailored explicitly for educational settings and systematically examine recent research trends concerning GenAI literacy. Employing a systematic literature review approach, 51 empirical studies published in 2023 and 2024 were selected and analysed based on five identified competencies of GenAI literacy: (1) know and understand GenAI, (2) use and apply GenAI, (3) evaluate and incorporate GenAI, (4) GenAI ethics, and (5) attitudes towards GenAI. The findings indicate that students demonstrated moderate understanding of GenAI concepts but frequently faced challenges in prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs. Ethical considerations, particularly related to academic integrity, privacy, and data security, were highlighted as significant concerns. Furthermore, positive student attitudes towards GenAI, including curiosity and self-efficacy, emerged as vital components enhancing engagement with GenAI tools. A five-step interaction model was proposed to help in fostering students' GenAI literacy, emphasising iterative and dynamic engagement with GenAI tools. This study underscores the necessity of explicitly integrating GenAI-specific competencies into educational practices and recommends clear institutional policies, and further empirical research to support the responsible, effective, and reflective use of GenAI in school settings.}

abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.}

Drawing on self-regulation theory, we examine how and when GenAI dependence promotes or inhibits service innovation in the hospitality industry. Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness. This exploration of when and how the use of GenAI either promotes or inhibits service innovation broadens our understanding of the consequences of GenAI dependence in the hospitality management field.}

We adopt a human-in-the-loop methodology and find that the GenAI assessments align closely with human evaluations. Compared to conventional methods, GenAI also offers methodological advantages and arguably provides a more reliable measurement of sentiment. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that the GenAI-driven sentiment index effectively captures public sentiment trends and robustly drives property sales. Furthermore, we utilise GenAI's strong comprehension abilities to identify cities mentioned in microblogs, thereby creating more granular sentiment indices at the city level. These city-level sentiment indices prove useful in predicting local property sales and revealing significant sentiment spillovers from major to smaller cities. Our research offers policymakers enhanced tools for timely market monitoring and underscores the transformative potential of GenAI in research and macroeconomic surveillance, enabling the analysis of previously unmanageable big and unstructured data.}

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices.}

Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.}

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.}

abstract = {In a radiation oncology clinic, machine downtime can be a serious burden to the entire department. This study investigates using increasingly popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist medical physicists in troubleshooting linear accelerator issues. Google's NotebookLM, supplemented with background information on linear accelerator issues/solutions, was used as a machine troubleshooting assistant for this purpose. Two board-certified medical physicists evaluated the large language model's responses based on hallucination, relevancy, correctness, and completeness. Results indicated that responses improved with increasing source data context and more specific prompt construction. Keeping risk mitigation and the inherent limitations of AI in mind, this work offers a viable, low-risk method to improve efficiency in radiation oncology. This work uses a “Machine Troubleshooting Assistance” application to provide an adaptable example of how radiation oncology clinics can begin using generative AI to enhance clinical efficiency.}

abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.}

Drawing from one field study on the Facebook Ad platform and two experimental studies, we find that brand avoidance among tourists is reduced when tourism brands adopt AI-generated (vs. human-generated) moral content to support stigmatized dissociative out-groups. This effect is mediated by tourists' psychological proximity to these groups and is weakened for those with a strong sense of common fate with these out-groups. These insights contribute to tourism literature on generative AI and diversity, equity, and inclusivity while offering strategic guidance for brands seeking to embrace stigmatized groups.}

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products. By integrating fuzzy social networks and MADM methodologies, this framework offers a rigorous, systematic evaluation tool that significantly improves decision-making accuracy and promotes the sustainable development of GAI applications.}

The study examines how government funding moderates these correlations. Employing PLS-SEM and fsQCA, the research elucidates complex interrelationships and causal paths. The findings reveal that GAI significantly enhances green knowledge management capabilities, which drives green innovation and entrepreneurship success. Additionally, government support plays a crucial role in amplifying these effects. This study contributes to technological change and social transformation discourse, offering practical insights for decision-makers and stakeholders in green entrepreneurship and policy-making.}

The rapid adoption of generative AI tools has demonstrated their transformative potential to effect significant improvements in the field of business management and change the work habits of their users. Considering the multitude of applicative possibilities offered by the technology, in addition to its nascence, there are significant concerns regarding how the technology can be utilised, necessitating GAIA assessment in the workplace. Existing instruments prove inadequate in providing a comprehensive measurement of GAIA. In response, this research adopts a mixed-method approach, comprising qualitative and quantitative insights from multiple studies. Drawing on multiple samples, this study develops and validates a second-order, reflective-reflective GAIA measure, comprising dimensions of integrative appropriation, adoptive appropriations, customised appropriation, interface appropriation and ethical appropriation. The research encompasses four studies with a distinctive focus on item generation, scale purification, scale refinement and nomological validation. The GAIA scale developed herein offers a robust and comprehensive measure that can be used to explicate, assess, and improve GAIA in the workplace.}

This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 %) and used it for general purposes (79.9 %). However, only 16.2 % actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 % were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 % felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 % had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 % viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.}

abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.}

As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery.

abstract = {In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies.}

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has provided the conditions for researchers to transition from sequential organization of bibliographic references to the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements. This study, reveals the intrinsic relationship patterns between multi-granularity knowledge in ancient texts from perspectives such as logical relationships, frame semantic associations, hierarchical structures, and feature associations, and constructs a multidimensional knowledge representation model for ancient texts. Furthermore, a YAML prompt template was designed by integrating large language models with the deconstruction of multi-granularity knowledge elements from ancient texts, and experiments were conducted using the Chinese classic “Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies.” The results indicate that the method developed in this study for the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements in ancient texts exhibits notable characteristics such as multi-granularity, cross-document application, refinement, multiple perspectives, efficiency improvement, and scalability, demonstrating potential for application in the field of knowledge services for ancient texts.}

The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal), good internal consistency (α = .92–.93), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman's behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.}

The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 % for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 % for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.}

Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design.}

This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools.}

abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher education, understanding the factors shaping students’ attitudes toward these technologies has become critical for effective pedagogical and institutional responses. This study examines how demographic characteristics, usage patterns, perceived GAI literacy, and ethical awareness relate to Chinese undergraduates’ attitudes toward GAI in academic contexts. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 895 university students from diverse majors. Participants completed a validated GAI Attitude Scale alongside demographic and experiential measures. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to explore how demographic, experiential, and ethical factors relate to students’ attitudes toward GAI. The findings indicate that female students perceived GAI as more useful than male students, while no significant differences were observed across grade levels. Students from non-humanities majors reported more positive attitudes than those in humanities. Regression results further showed that GAI usage frequency and ethical awareness were the strongest predictors of positive attitudes, while demographic factors such as year of study and major became non-significant once other variables were considered. The final model explained 26 % of the variance in overall attitudes. These results suggest that students’ acceptance of GAI is shaped less by demographic background than by their engagement with and ethical awareness of the technology. The study highlights the need for universities to integrate both practical training and ethical guidance into GAI-related teaching and policy.}

To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically identify and assess the existing body of knowledge on the GAI and green logistics nexus, drawing on a systematic literature review carried out in compliance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics. This research fills current knowledge gaps and has significant implications for supply chain stakeholders, scholars, and policymakers aiming to support sustainable and cutting-edge logistics systems.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.}

To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.}

Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide. As indicated by the significant moderating roles of GenAI proficiency, to fully leverage the power of GenAI, improving GenAI proficiency can be crucial to ensure learning effectiveness for learners with different levels of learning preparation.}

This study proposes a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-enhanced multiagent approach that aims to promote collaborative problem solving across different learning domains. The study also examines the effectiveness of this GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach to collaborative problem solving. In total, 234 college students participated in two empirical studies that focused on different tasks but had the same purpose and procedure. Experimental group 1 engaged in collaborative problem-solving with the assistance of a GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach. Experimental group 2 engaged in collaborative problem solving via a chatbot-based approach. The control group engaged in traditional collaborative problem-solving without any support. Data were collected through the pretest, posttest, and collaborative problem-solving process records and interview records. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to analyze the data. The results indicated that compared with chatbot-based and traditional approaches, the GenAI-enhanced multiagent approach had more significant effects on learning achievements, knowledge elaboration, and collaborative problem-solving performance and skills. The implications of these findings are discussed in depth with the goal of advancing the use of GenAI to empower collaborative problem solving.}

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.}

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field. Hence, this review offers clear avenues for future investigation, empowering researchers to expand and refine Generative AI toward achieving a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable construction.}

In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials.}

There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland.}

As part of this low-carbon transition, smart energy systems have been an active area of research and education, where artificial intelligence (AI) intersects with energy science. It is an emerging area where research and education face new challenges as new knowledge keeps coming in. During this process, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a critical role in education and research activities. However, GAI's impact on smart energy systems research and education is less discussed. Especially, its impact on education is rarely discussed when compared to research. GAI reshapes both the research process and the roles of teachers and students in the course. This perspective offers insights into the ongoing research and education paradigm shifts observed in the smart energy system. This perspective synthesizes existing studies on "GAI for Science" and "GAI for Education" practices in the field of smart energy systems. In research, the impact of GAI is discussed from both macro and micro levels. In education, this perspective examines how a GAI-driven teaching approach addresses the challenges of teaching smart energy systems compared to the traditional approach. This perspective could benefit the discussion of GAI-reshaped research and education in energy science.}

However, empirical studies on CT skill cultivation in GenAI-assisted learning are limited, especially in prevalent multimodal contexts. Integrating the CT skill framework and visual grammar, this qualitative case study developed a teaching module to foster undergraduates’ CT skills in GenAI-assisted digital multimodal composing (DMC), focusing on non-proficient AI users. It further explored four groups’ learning experiences in the classroom through students’ GenAI-assisted PowerPoint products, reflective writings, interviews, and design process observation. The findings revealed students’ more thoughtful scrutiny, comprehensive evaluation, and selective adoption of multimodal AIGC to achieve communicative purposes, with group variations and limitations in each dimension. This progress was facilitated by collaborative, revision-based DMC classwork with specifically defined, multi-dimensional requirements, systematic framework teaching, and real-time scaffolding. In conclusion, collaborative GenAI-assisted DMC practice with systematic instructional support can significantly foster students’ CT skill cultivation. These findings illuminate future pedagogical innovations to encourage deep learning and higher-order cognitive skills among a broader range of students in GenAI-assisted multimodal contexts.}

They identified several application areas for GenAI in the industrial work context, such as design, planning, training, problem solving, coding and data management. They also expressed positive attitudes but raised concerns about trust, safety, acceptability and interoperability. Changes in work were identified as being more related to cognitive aspects such as changing the way of thinking and altering the interaction with people and machines. Therefore, human-AI design efforts should focus especially on cognitive ergonomics.

We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology.}

abstract = {The prediction and health management (PHM) of rolling bearings have evolved toward data-driven transformation under Industry 4.0. Generative artificial intelligence, which generates content with logical consistency and coherence based on the multimodal large models, provides a novel data generation technology for intelligent PHM of rolling bearing that suffers from insufficient samples of incomplete measurement. However, the generated data lacks physical interpretability due to the black-box nature. The rolling bearing fault or degradation features represented by the generated data can only be recognized by intelligent models and cannot be explained manually. To address this issue, a generative artificial intelligence method for vibration data of rolling bearing with multi-domain joint loss and interpretable physical laws is proposed. Small samples measured from the fault stage of the rolling bearing are input into the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to fit the parameter of stiffness and damping ratio, the simulated data can be obtained by solving the dynamic model of rolling bearing with fitted parameters, and the physical laws of the rolling bearing working in the fault stage are described by the impulse response and fault frequency features of the simulated data. In the degradation stage of rolling bearings, the parameters' sequence of stiffness and damping ratio are fitted, respectively, by inputting a small sample of measured degradation data into MLP, and the future trends of parameter sequences are predicted by the temporal convolutional network (TCN) with single-step iterative prediction method. The simulated degradation data is produced by solving the dynamic model with fitted parameter sequences, which follow the physical laws of the rolling bearing working in the degradation stage. Experimental validation, ablation, and comparison experiments are carried out based on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and XJTU-SY bearing datasets. The results show that the simulated data exhibit similar distribution characteristics to the measured data in time and frequency domains, which corresponds to physical laws and provides clear interpretability.}

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.}

abstract = {Rapid technical advances have spurred the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in various business settings. However, the tourism industry is in the early stages of understanding and applying GenAI, and comprehensive knowledge is needed. This paper presents a systematic review of the empirical literature, published between 2022 and 2024, related to GenAI in the business and tourism fields. Findings draw a detailed picture of the state of GenAI research. In total, 170 published articles are reviewed based on topics, theories, and methods. Three main topic clusters are identified: 1) antecedents of using GenAI; 2) impacts and applications of GenAI; and 3) technicalities of GenAI. Theoretically, most studies have borrowed foundations from other fields without substantial development. Methodologically, existing research—particularly in tourism—has tended to feature quantitative techniques. This research also compares business and tourism literature based on an antecedents, process and outcomes framework, outlining potential research gaps and opportunities. In addition to synthesizing the current research landscape, this paper presents a multidimensional framework (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods – TCCM) that suggests multiple future research questions to inform GenAI studies in tourism.}

From this point of view, this study presents how to solve computer-aided design (CAD) problems using GenAI-human collaboration, where a GenAI tool generates structured code (syntax) for CAD while a designer articulates the design intent (semantics). The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively. The findings support the development of advanced human-AI co-creation systems and encourage future research in areas such as reverse engineering, multi-part assemblies, and collaborative CAD workflows coupled with complex design constraints.}

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.}

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.}

abstract = {Background
The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into academic publishing presents new opportunities and ethical challenges. Transparent editorial oversight is essential, yet the extent of GenAI policy adoption among vascular surgery journals remains unclear.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional review of vascular surgery journals indexed in the 2024 Scimago Journal Rank and Google Scholar Metrics. Eligible journals were active, peer-reviewed titles regularly publishing vascular surgery research. As of June 12, 2025, 2 independent reviewers assessed author instructions, journal websites, and publisher policies for GenAI-related guidance. Extracted variables included permitted GenAI applications (e.g., language editing, image generation), disclosure requirements, authorship restrictions, naming of specific tools, and human accountability clauses. Journal characteristics—geographic origin, Scimago Journal Rank quartile, and H-index—were also recorded. Descriptive statistics and Welch's t-tests were used for analysis.
Results
Of 25 journals evaluated, 18 (72%) had explicit GenAI editorial policies. All prohibited attributing authorship to artificial intelligence (AI) tools and emphasized human responsibility. Nineteen journals (76%) required disclosure of GenAI use, but only 14 (56%) specified disclosure location. Thirteen (52%) addressed AI-generated images. Journals permitting GenAI-assisted language editing had significantly higher H-indices (70.2 vs. 20.7; P = 0.0167). Scimago Journal Rank Q1/Q2 journals demonstrated more comprehensive policies than lower-tier journals (6.8 vs. 4.0 elements; P = 0.0094). US- and UK-based journals led in policy specificity.
Conclusion
While GenAI policies are increasingly present in vascular surgery journals, inconsistencies persist. Standardized, enforceable editorial guidance is needed to ensure ethical and transparent integration of GenAI into scholarly publishing.}

These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention.
