abstract = {Background
Discharge instructions are a key form of documentation and patient communication in the time of transition from the emergency department (ED) to home. Discharge instructions are time-consuming and often underprioritized, especially in the ED, leading to discharge delays and possibly impersonal patient instructions. Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) offer promising methods of creating high-quality and personalized discharge instructions; however, there exists a gap in understanding patient perspectives of LLM-generated discharge instructions.
Objective
We aimed to assess the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT in synthesizing accurate and patient-accessible discharge instructions in the ED.
Methods
We synthesized 5 unique, fictional ED encounters to emulate real ED encounters that included a diverse set of clinician history, physical notes, and nursing notes. These were passed to GPT-4 in Azure OpenAI Service (Microsoft) to generate LLM-generated discharge instructions. Standard discharge instructions were also generated for each of the 5 unique ED encounters. All GPT-generated and standard discharge instructions were then formatted into standardized after-visit summary documents. These after-visit summaries containing either GPT-generated or standard discharge instructions were randomly and blindly administered to Amazon MTurk respondents representing patient populations through Amazon MTurk Survey Distribution. Discharge instructions were assessed based on metrics of interpretability of significance, understandability, and satisfaction.
Results
Our findings revealed that survey respondents’ perspectives regarding GPT-generated and standard discharge instructions were significantly (P=.01) more favorable toward GPT-generated return precautions, and all other sections were considered noninferior to standard discharge instructions. Of the 156 survey respondents, GPT-generated discharge instructions were assigned favorable ratings, “agree” and “strongly agree,” more frequently along the metric of interpretability of significance in discharge instruction subsections regarding diagnosis, procedures, treatment, post-ED medications or any changes to medications, and return precautions. Survey respondents found GPT-generated instructions to be more understandable when rating procedures, treatment, post-ED medications or medication changes, post-ED follow-up, and return precautions. Satisfaction with GPT-generated discharge instruction subsections was the most favorable in procedures, treatment, post-ED medications or medication changes, and return precautions. Wilcoxon rank-sum test of Likert responses revealed significant differences (P=.01) in the interpretability of significant return precautions in GPT-generated discharge instructions compared to standard discharge instructions but not for other evaluation metrics and discharge instruction subsections.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential for LLMs such as ChatGPT to act as a method of augmenting current documentation workflows in the ED to reduce the documentation burden of physicians. The ability of LLMs to provide tailored instructions for patients by improving readability and making instructions more applicable to patients could improve upon the methods of communication that currently exist.}

abstract = {Background
Sepsis is a severe syndrome of organ dysfunction caused by infection; it has high heterogeneity and high in-hospital mortality, representing a grim clinical challenge for precision medicine in critical care.
Objective
We aimed to extract reported sepsis biomarkers to provide users with comprehensive biomedical information and integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy, stability, and interpretability of clinical decisions recommended by large language models (LLMs).
Methods
To address the challenge, we established and updated the first knowledge-enhanced platform, MetaSepsisKnowHub, comprising 427 sepsis biomarkers and 423 studies, aiming to systematically collect and annotate sepsis biomarkers to guide personalized clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of human sepsis. We curated a tailored LLM framework incorporating RAG and prompt engineering and incorporated 2 performance evaluation scales: the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score.
Results
The overall quantitative ratings of expert-reviewed clinical recommendations based on RAG surpassed baseline responses generated by 4 LLMs and showed a statistically significant improvement in textual questions (GPT-4: mean 75.79, SD 7.11 vs mean 81.59, SD 9.87; P=.02; GPT-4o: mean 70.36, SD 7.63 vs mean 77.98, SD 13.26; P=.02; Qwen2.5-instruct: mean 77.08 SD 3.75 vs mean 85.46, SD 7.27; P<.001; and DeepSeek-R1: mean 77.67, SD 3.66 vs mean 86.42, SD 8.56; P<.001), but no significant statistical differences could be measured in clinical scenarios. The RAG assessment score comparing RAG-based responses and expert-provided benchmark answers illustrated prominent factual correctness, accuracy, and knowledge recall compared to the baseline responses. After use, the average the System Usability Scale score was 82.20 (SD 14.17) and the Net Promoter Score was 72, demonstrating high user satisfaction and loyalty.
Conclusions
We highlight the pioneering MetaSepsisKnowHub platform, and we show that combining MetaSepsisKnowHub with RAG can minimize limitations on precision and maximize the breadth of LLMs to shorten the bench-to-bedside distance, serving as a knowledge-enhanced paradigm for future application of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine.}

keywords = {Non-invasive scores, mtDNA, //, GPT-4, MASLD-HCC},
abstract = {Background & aims
Mitochondrial (mt-) D-loop and cell-free circulating (ccf-) mtDNA fragments, respectively reflecting mt-mass and tissue damage, are promising metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biomarkers. We previously found that PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 deficiency in HepG2 cells increased mt-mass, D-loop levels, and ccf-COXIII release. We explored mt-biogenesis and mt-biomarkers in patients with MASLD stratified by the number of risk variants (NRV = 3). We exploited GPT-4 to develop and validate new risk scores, predicting MASLD evolution, in two independent cohorts by integrating anthropometric and genetic data with mt-biomarkers.
Methods
A cohort of 28 patients with MASLD (Discovery cohort) was consecutively enrolled for hepatic mt-dynamics assessment by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR in a retrospective cohort (Hepatic Validation, n = 184). D-loop and ccf-COXIII were retrospectively measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples of biopsied outpatients with MASLD (Serum Validation cohort, n = 824) and individuals with non-invasive MASLD diagnosis (n = 386, Non-invasive cohort). Risk scores were developed using random forest algorithms.
Results
In the Discovery and Hepatic Validation cohorts, the PNPLA3/MBOAT7/TM6SF2 variants altered hepatic mt-dynamics, enhancing mt-content and D-loop levels (p <0.05) through the p38/PGC-1α pathway. Furthermore, NRV = 3 patients showed an increase in mt-fragmentation at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ccf-COXIII release (p <0.05). In the Serum Validation cohort, circulating D-loop and ccf-COXIII positively correlated with genetics [βD-loop:0.17 (95% CI: 0.04–0.29), p = 0.01; βccf-COXIII:0.33 (95% CI: 0.19–0.46), p <0.0001] and MASLD severity [ORD-loop:1.31 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71), p = 0.03; ORccf-COXIII:2.41 (95% CI: 1.69-3.44), p <0.0001] at multivariate analysis. Random forest allowed prediction models named Mitochondrial, Anthropometric, and Genetic Integration with Computational intelligence for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma risk (MAGIC-H), considering age, BMI genetics, D-loop, and ccf-COXIII. In both Serum and Non-invasive cohorts, the MAGIC-H score reached AUC >85% in identifying HCC cases regardless of cirrhosis, outperforming existing non-invasive tests.
Conclusions
Mt-biomarkers have a prognostic significance in genetically-predisposed patients with MASLD.
Impact and implications
The study highlights that genetic variants in PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 genes deeply contribute to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression by affecting hepatic mitochondrial adaptability. It also identified two novel biomarkers of mitochondrial origin which are strongly linked to disease severity and genetic background of patients with MASLD. The use of generative artificial intelligence tools, such as GPT-4, can enhance the use of biomarkers and polygenic risk scores for clinical risk stratification. We developed a customized version of GPT-4 (rsGPT-4), which identified a machine-learning approach (random forest) as the best method for creating prediction models for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new scores combined the two mitochondrial biomarkers, genetic data, and anthropometric data and outperformed existing non-invasive tests for monitoring patients with MASLD.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) have garnered excitement about their potential for delegating writing tasks ordinarily performed by humans. Many of these tasks (eg, writing recommendation letters) have social and professional ramifications, making the potential social biases in ChatGPT’s underlying language model a serious concern.
Objective
Three preregistered studies used the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to investigate gender bias in recommendation letters written by ChatGPT in human-use sessions (N=1400 total letters).
Methods
We conducted analyses using 22 existing Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionaries, as well as 6 newly created dictionaries based on systematic reviews of gender bias in recommendation letters, to compare recommendation letters generated for the 200 most historically popular “male” and “female” names in the United States. Study 1 used 3 different letter-writing prompts intended to accentuate professional accomplishments associated with male stereotypes, female stereotypes, or neither. Study 2 examined whether lengthening each of the 3 prompts while holding the between-prompt word count constant modified the extent of bias. Study 3 examined the variability within letters generated for the same name and prompts. We hypothesized that when prompted with gender-stereotyped professional accomplishments, ChatGPT would evidence gender-based language differences replicating those found in systematic reviews of human-written recommendation letters (eg, more affiliative, social, and communal language for female names; more agentic and skill-based language for male names).
Results
Significant differences in language between letters generated for female versus male names were observed across all prompts, including the prompt hypothesized to be neutral, and across nearly all language categories tested. Historically female names received significantly more social referents (5/6, 83% of prompts), communal or doubt-raising language (4/6, 67% of prompts), personal pronouns (4/6, 67% of prompts), and clout language (5/6, 83% of prompts). Contradicting the study hypotheses, some gender differences (eg, achievement language and agentic language) were significant in both the hypothesized and nonhypothesized directions, depending on the prompt. Heteroscedasticity between male and female names was observed in multiple linguistic categories, with greater variance for historically female names than for historically male names.
Conclusions
ChatGPT reproduces many gender-based language biases that have been reliably identified in investigations of human-written reference letters, although these differences vary across prompts and language categories. Caution should be taken when using ChatGPT for tasks that have social consequences, such as reference letter writing. The methods developed in this study may be useful for ongoing bias testing among progressive generations of chatbots across a range of real-world scenarios.

abstract = {Purpose
There is no “Gold Standard” test that allows the diagnosis and classification of alterations and pathologies related to Meibomian glands (MG). A global evaluation of objective and subjective tests is necessary to determine the final diagnosis. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have experienced great progress in the field of health sciences, as promising techniques for predicting pathologies from data and images. The main objective of this study has been to train ML classifiers for the classification of three groups of participants with and without MG alterations. The secondary objective was to study the precision, specificity and sensitivity of the ML classifiers.
Methods
A retrospective comparative study was carried out on a total of 135 participants (control, contact lens wearers and MG pathology). Symptomatology and clinical tests were performed to evaluate the ocular surface and adnexa. The numerical data obtained from these tests were used to train ML classifiers and the top 5 were subsequently verified.
Results
Accuracies greater than 76 % were obtained for the training group and greater than 79 % for the verification group, for five classifiers previously described in Matlab. Subspace KNN was the classifier with the highest accuracies, specificities and sensitivities, these being moderate-high (greater than 79 %).
Conclusions
ML algorithms can be useful for classifying groups of participants with various meibomian gland disorders using clinical data. A large number of participants is needed for reliable diagnostic accuracy.}

abstract = {Background
Discussing weight remains a sensitive and often avoided topic in health care, despite rising prevalence of obesity and calls for earlier, more compassionate interventions. Many health care professionals report inadequate training and low confidence to discuss weight, while patients often describe feeling stigmatized or dismissed. Digital simulation offers a promising route to build communication skills through supporting repeatable and reflective practice in a safe space. VITAL-COMS (Virtual Training and Assessment for Communication Skills) is a novel simulation tool designed to support health care professionals in navigating weight-related conversations with greater understanding and skill.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the potential of VITAL-COMS as a digital simulation training tool to improve weight-related communication skills among health care professionals.
Methods
A mixed-method feasibility study was conducted online via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) between January to July 2021, with UK-based nurses, doctors, and dietitians. The intervention comprised educational videos and 2 simulated patient scenarios with real-time verbal interaction. Pre- and posttraining self-assessments of communication skills and conversation length were collected. Participants also completed a feasibility questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the feasibility questionnaire, and open-ended feedback was analyzed using content analysis. Paired-samples t tests were used to assess changes in communication skills and conversation length before and post training.
Results
In total, 31 participants completed the study. There was a statistically significant improvement in self-assessed communication skills following training (mean difference=3.9; 95% CI, 2.54‐5.26; t30=−5.76, P=.001, Cohen d=1.03). Mean conversation length increased significantly in both scenarios: in the female patient scenario, from 3.73 (SD 1.36) to 6.08 (SD 2.26) minutes, with a mean difference of 2.35 minutes (95% CI, 1.71‐2.99; t30=7.49, P=.001, Cohen d=1.34); and in the male scenario, from 3.61 (SD 1.12) to 5.65 (SD 1.76) minutes, a mean difference of 2.03 minutes (95% CI, 1.51‐2.55; t30=8.03, P=.001, Cohen d=1.44). Participants rated the simulation positively, with 97% (95% CI 90%‐100%) supporting wider use in health care and 84% (95% CI 71%‐97%) reporting emotional engagement. Content analysis of feedback generated two themes: (1) adapting to this form of learning and (2) recognizing the potential of simulation to support reflective, skills-based training. A minority, 13% (95% CI 1%‐25%) expressed a preference for alternative learning methods.
Conclusions
VITAL-COMS was feasible to implement and acceptable to a diverse group of health care professionals. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in self-assessed communication skills and patient-scenario engagement. The simulation was perceived as realistic, emotionally engaging, and well-suited for training in sensitive conversations. These findings support further development and integration of VITAL-COMS into health education programs. Next steps include the translation of the insights identified in this study to inform a tool supported by generative artificial intelligence.}

abstract = {Acute food bolus impaction is frequently encountered in pediatric patients with underlying esophageal conditions. Traditional endoscopic methods for removing friable boluses, such as meat, are often time-intensive and challenging. This report explores the novel application of cryoadhesion, or freezing and adhering an object to a cryoprobe, for esophageal meat bolus extraction. A 25-year-old man with trisomy 21 and eosinophilic esophagitis presented with acute food bolus impaction. After unsuccessful conventional endoscopic maneuvers, a cryoprobe was externally attached to an endoscope and used to achieve cryoadhesion and extraction of the meat bolus. Within 10 minutes, the meat bolus was successfully removed attached to the cryoprobe without mucosal injury. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged the next day without adverse events. Cryoadhesion via a flexible cryoprobe may offer a feasible alternative for removing challenging food impactions. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate its safety and efficacy.}

abstract = {Generative models represent a pivotal innovation in machine learning, particularly impacting image Classification through synthetic data generation. These models enhance training datasets by introducing greater diversity and robustness, improving the predictive accuracy of Classification algorithms. Among the best methods, generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and probabilistic graph models stand out for their complex structures and wide range of uses, from medical imaging to self-driving cars. Despite their advantages, these models present distinct challenges. GANs often suffer from mode collapse, where the model fails to capture the diversity of the input data. Diffusion models require extensive computational resources, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. Probabilistic graph models, while powerful, involve complex implementation procedures that can impede their use in scalable solutions. Moreover, issues such as limited interpretability and ethical concerns further restrict the broader deployment of these technologies. This paper aims to address these challenges by analyzing these generative models’ architecture, efficacy, and application areas and critically examining their limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing discourse by proposing research directions to improve model transparency and computational efficiency, stabilize training processes, and integrate ethical considerations into model development. The ultimate aim is to harness the full potential of generative models in critical application areas by mitigating their current limitations. By advancing research in these directions, we can better leverage these powerful tools for applications demanding high precision and reliability, such as in medical diagnostics, precision agriculture, and the development of robust autonomous systems.}

Through a prospective approach and an exhaustive review of the scientific literature, the study examines how AI can transform the management of educational institutions by optimizing decision-making processes, enhancing administrative efficiency, and personalizing educational pathways through the analysis of large datasets. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI are highlighted, notably its inability to replicate essential human competencies such as empathy, intuition, inspiring leadership, and nuanced understanding of human interactions. Consequently, a hybrid leadership model is proposed, where AI acts as a high-performing assistant for routine tasks, while human educational directors focus on strategic and relational aspects. Thus, although AI offers significant advantages for educational management, it cannot entirely substitute for the indispensable role of the human educational director.}

keywords = {conversational agents, chatbots, behavior change, smoking cessation, motivational interviewing, deep learning, natural language processing, transformers, generative artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client’s statements, using a generative language model.
Objective
This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections.
Methods
Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants’ readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections.
Results
The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations.
Conclusions
The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.}

abstract = {Background
Despite potential risks, artificial intelligence–based chatbots that simulate psychotherapy are becoming more widely available and frequently used by the general public. A comprehensive way of evaluating the quality of these chatbots is needed.
Objective
To address this need, we developed the CAPE (Conversational Agent for Psychotherapy Evaluation) framework to aid clinicians, researchers, and lay users in assessing psychotherapy chatbot quality. We use the framework to evaluate and compare the quality of popular artificial intelligence psychotherapy chatbots on the OpenAI GPT store.
Methods
We identified 4 popular chatbots on OpenAI’s GPT store. Two reviewers independently applied the CAPE framework to these chatbots, using 2 fictional personas to simulate interactions. The modular framework has 8 sections, each yielding an independent quality subscore between 0 and 1. We used t tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests to examine pairwise differences in quality subscores between chatbots.
Results
Chatbots consistently scored highly on the sections of background information (subscores=0.83-1), conversational capabilities (subscores=0.83-1), therapeutic alliance, and boundaries (subscores=0.75-1), and accessibility (subscores=0.8-0.95). Scores were low for the therapeutic orientation (subscores=0) and monitoring and risk evaluation sections (subscores=0.67-0.75). Information on training data and knowledge base sections was not transparent (subscores=0). Except for the privacy and harm section (mean 0.017, SD 0.00; t3=∞; P<.001), there were no differences in subscores between the chatbots.
Conclusions
The CAPE framework offers a robust and reliable method for assessing the quality of psychotherapy chatbots, enabling users to make informed choices based on their specific needs and preferences. Our evaluation revealed that while the popular chatbots on OpenAI’s GPT store were effective at developing rapport and were easily accessible, they failed to address essential safety and privacy functions adequately.}

Artificial Intelligence AI is increasingly becoming a foundation of competitive planning for contemporary organizations. However, even though the implementation of AI in organizations is a critical intervention that can unlock new forms of value, many of these implementations do not meet the expected outcomes. They may result in substantial financial, operational, and reputational negative consequences. This systematic literature review starts with a sample of 3104 articles from well-reputed journals published between 2010-2024. It aims to examine several questions that surround the occurrence of AI failure in organizations: the reasons behind those failures, the categories of the failures, and the disciplinary areas of the failures. Moreover, customers', employees', and management's points of view are considered in the review to extrapolate the potential consequences of the failure of AI systems. The result demonstrates that the AI breakdown often results from a mixture of technology, organization, and people problems and that different industries exhibit diverce types of failures.}

Ovarian steroid cell tumors not otherwise specified (OSCT-NOS) are extremely rare ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, accounting for <0.1 % of all ovarian tumors. In 25 % of cases, they are asymptomatic leading to a delay in diagnosis. We, herein, report a singular case of OSCT-NOS diagnosed incidentally during the spread assessment of an invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NOS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of co-occurrence of OSCT-NOS and IBC-NOS. We aim to study the clinic-pathological characteristics of this rare tumor.
Case presentation
A 56-years old postmenopausal female, with no previous medical history, was diagnosed with an invasive IBC-NOS. The tomography performed during the spread assessment of IBC-NOS showed a suspicious mass of the right ovary. Pelvic MRI revealed an ovarian solid T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense mass. The first evoked diagnosis was an ovarian metastasis of the IBC-NOS. The patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. On gross examination, an ovarian solid mass measuring 2,5x2cm, with a firm gray yellowish cut surface was noted. Microscopic examination and immunostaining concluded to OSCT-NOS and ruled out the diagnosis of an ovarian metastasis of IBC-NOS.
Conclusion
OSCT-NOS are rare neoplasms. Their diagnosis might be challenging especially in absence of hormonal symptoms. A better knowledge of this rare entities would enable early diagnosis.}

abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) established in 2021 an annual health limit of 5μg/m3 for outdoor PM2.5 concentrations (cPM2.5). Our objective was to evaluate the health impact of cPM2.5 in two locations of a large city during 2023. In the first study (South; more socially vulnerable), the 5μg/m3 limit was exceeded 70% of the time. Additionally, 26% of the values were above 15μg/m3. In the second study (Central), this limit (5μg/m3) was exceeded 99% of the time, and 64% of the values were above 15μg/m3. Based on data from both locations (1,149,930 inhabitants over the age of 25), annual lung cancer mortality ranged from 23 to 38 cases (6.7%–8.7%), while mortality from non-communicable diseases ranged from 700 to 854 cases (10.7%–12.3%). The avoidable burden of mortality attributable to annual PM2.5 concentrations justifies the urgent need for their drastic reduction as a public health policy.
Resumen
La WHO estableció en 2021 un límite anual sanitario de concentración de PM2.5 (cPM2.5) en el ambiente de 5μg/m3. Nuestro objetivo es el evaluar el impacto en salud de cPM2.5 en 2 localizaciones de una gran ciudad durante 2023. En el primer estudio (Sur, más vulnerable socialmente) el 70% del tiempo excedía el límite de 5μg/m3. Además, el 26% de los valores estaban por encima de los 15μg/m3. En el segundo estudio (Central) el 99% del tiempo excedía el límite de 5μg/m3, y el 64% de los valores estaban por encima de los 15μg/m3. Con los datos de ambas localizaciones (1.149.930 habitantes con edad superior a 25 años), la mortalidad anual por cáncer de pulmón oscila entre 23 y 38 casos (6,7-8,7%), mientras que la mortalidad por enfermedades no comunicables oscila entre 700 y 854 casos (10,7-12,3%). La carga de mortalidad evitable atribuible a las concentraciones anuales de PM2.5 justifica la necesidad urgente de su drástica reducción como política de salud pública.}

It begins with a review of current approaches to assessing listening comprehension skills and then discusses the task types that are prevalent in listening comprehension assessment. The entry then identifies limitations in these practices, including the authenticity of task materials, such as restricted accent variations and the absence of non-verbal visual inputs in some, alongside the “over-standardization” of tests that may fail to accommodate individual learning preferences. To overcome these challenges, we suggest several potential solutions. These include the integration of sensor technologies to enhance the capture of test-takers’ performances beyond traditional ratings, the development of an adaptive assessment system tailored to individual learning trajectories, and the application of Generative AI (GenAI) to create customized listening tasks.}

Chest wall tumors are common and predominantly benign. Exceptionally, long-standing evolution over decades can lead to the development of giant tumors, posing substantial technical and strategic challenges in determining the optimal surgical approach.
Presentation of case
We report a rare case of a giant pedunculated chest wall lipoma that had been growing for over 40 years in a 73-year-old man. CT scan revealed a mass with a 5 cm-suprascapular-implantation base, hanging posteriorly and mimicking a pseudo-limb, measuring 17 × 7 cm in diameter and 34 cm in length. Complete surgical resection was performed, and histopathology confirmed a benign lipoma with no signs of malignancy.
Clinical discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a huge lipoma with more than 40 years of evolution and an unusual pedunculated presentation resembling a third upper limb.
Conclusion
This case is exceptional due to its pedunculated appearance resembling an additional limb, and a slow evolution over more than 40 years. Complete surgical resection ensures a favorable prognosis.}

abstract = {Introduction
The intrahepatic location of the gallbladder is one of the most common ectopic locations of the gallbladder. An intrahepatic gallbladder often exhibits impaired function, which may lead to stasis and gallstone formation. Given the surgical complexities associated with this ectopic location, the traditional open approach is usually employed.
Case report
The authors report the case of a 52-year-old female patient who consulted for pain in the right hypochondrium. Physical examination revealed only right upper quadrant pain on palpation. Abdominal ultrasound revealed gallbladder lithiasis without indicating the presence of an anatomical anomaly. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in the “French position” with 4 trocars. During surgery, we discovered an intrahepatic gallbladder. Subserosal dissection of the gallbladder was done without having to perform a hepatotomy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 without any complications.
Discussion
Intra hepatic location of gallbladder is rare and can be detected by ultrasound or CT scan but in our study, it has not been detected by ultrasound before operation. Laparoscopic approach for a gallstone within ectopic gallbladder is rarely described in literature because cholecystectomy by conventional route is preferred when this anomaly is known and mostly when gallbladder is completely embedded within the liver.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the gold standard for a partial intrahepatic gallbladder.}

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the colon (LCNECC) are exceptionally rare, comprising only 0.2 % of all colonic carcinomas. Their diagnosis poses a significant challenge due to their propensity to mimic colonic adenocarcinomas. Typically diagnosed at advanced stages, LCNECCs carry a grim prognosis. Herein, we present a rare case of LCNECC and aim to elucidate its clinico-pathological characteristics.
Case presentation
A 56-year-old female patient presented with complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, and weight loss. On physical examination, a sizable mass was palpable in the right flank. Colonoscopy revealed a polyp in the descending colon and a friable multinodular stenosing mass in the ascending colon. Microscopic examination of the biopsy from the ascending colon mass exhibited a poorly differentiated large cell carcinomatous proliferation with positivity for synaptophysin and CD56, along with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 50 %. The polyp in the descending colon was consistent with a low-grade dysplastic tubular adenoma. A diagnosis of LCNECC with synchronous low-grade dysplastic tubular adenoma was established. A right hemicoloctomy was performed. Final pathological examination confirmed LCNECC invading the muscularis propria, with lymph node metastases. The tumor was classified as pT2N1M0 (Stage III).
Clinical discussion
LCNECCs often mimic adenocarcinomas clinically, endoscopically, and radiologically. Pathological examination is the key for diagnosis. An immunohistochemical study using neuroendocrine markers is imperative to prevent overlooking the diagnosis of LCNECC.
Conclusion
LCNECCs represent rare aggressive carcinomas. Their diagnosis might be challenging. A better knowledge of this rare entities would enable early diagnosis.}

abstract = {Purpose
To determine whether and how the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) underneath a scalp flap after temporal fascia harvest reduces postoperative donor-site complications in microtia surgery.
Methods
This case‒control study included patients with congenital microtia who underwent primary ear reconstruction with porous polyethylene implants between 2018 and 2021. Group No-ADM patients (2018–2019), Group ADM patients (2020–2021). The skin quality outcomes of the scalp flap after temporal fascia harvest were analysed through pinch tests and ultrasound imaging. Aesthetical and psychosocial outcomes were tested with standardized questionnaires that were administered to the patients and their parents.
Results
20 patients (60% male), 8 (40%) in the No-ADM group and 12 (60%) in the ADM group. Re-do surgery rate was higher in the No-ADM group than in the ADM group (17.5% vs 5%; p<0.05). The pinch test was used to assess the recovery of tissue elasticity in the 100% ADM group, and it was negative in the 75% No-ADM group (p <0.05). The median US thickness was 4.87 mm in the No-ADM group and 4.48 mm in the ADM group (p=0.37). Aesthetic analysis revealed higher satisfaction levels among patients in the ADM group than in those in the non-ADM group. There was no significant difference in terms of quality of life between the two groups.
Conclusions
ADM use decreases local morbidity after facial harvest in the temporoparietal region. The greater thickness of the skin in the No-ADM group despite the absence of the ADM was probably due to greater fibrogenesis, which was limited by the ADM in the ADM group. In conclusion, ADM reduces the risk of postoperative subcutaneous scar adhesions.}

abstract = {Background
Medical documentation plays a crucial role in clinical practice, facilitating accurate patient management and communication among health care professionals. However, inaccuracies in medical notes can lead to miscommunication and diagnostic errors. Additionally, the demands of documentation contribute to physician burnout. Although intermediaries like medical scribes and speech recognition software have been used to ease this burden, they have limitations in terms of accuracy and addressing provider-specific metrics. The integration of ambient artificial intelligence (AI)–powered solutions offers a promising way to improve documentation while fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.
Objective
This study aims to assess the accuracy and quality of Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) notes generated by ChatGPT-4, an AI model, using established transcripts of History and Physical Examination as the gold standard. We seek to identify potential errors and evaluate the model’s performance across different categories.
Methods
We conducted simulated patient-provider encounters representing various ambulatory specialties and transcribed the audio files. Key reportable elements were identified, and ChatGPT-4 was used to generate SOAP notes based on these transcripts. Three versions of each note were created and compared to the gold standard via chart review; errors generated from the comparison were categorized as omissions, incorrect information, or additions. We compared the accuracy of data elements across versions, transcript length, and data categories. Additionally, we assessed note quality using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI) scoring system.
Results
Although ChatGPT-4 consistently generated SOAP-style notes, there were, on average, 23.6 errors per clinical case, with errors of omission (86%) being the most common, followed by addition errors (10.5%) and inclusion of incorrect facts (3.2%). There was significant variance between replicates of the same case, with only 52.9% of data elements reported correctly across all 3 replicates. The accuracy of data elements varied across cases, with the highest accuracy observed in the “Objective” section. Consequently, the measure of note quality, assessed by PDQI, demonstrated intra- and intercase variance. Finally, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 was inversely correlated to both the transcript length (P=.05) and the number of scorable data elements (P=.05).
Conclusions
Our study reveals substantial variability in errors, accuracy, and note quality generated by ChatGPT-4. Errors were not limited to specific sections, and the inconsistency in error types across replicates complicated predictability. Transcript length and data complexity were inversely correlated with note accuracy, raising concerns about the model’s effectiveness in handling complex medical cases. The quality and reliability of clinical notes produced by ChatGPT-4 do not meet the standards required for clinical use. Although AI holds promise in health care, caution should be exercised before widespread adoption. Further research is needed to address accuracy, variability, and potential errors. ChatGPT-4, while valuable in various applications, should not be considered a safe alternative to human-generated clinical documentation at this time.}

abstract = {Foundation models hold great potential for medical image segmentation, but their application depends on extensive labeled data, the collection of which is often restricted by data privacy. In response, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been used to synthesize realistic medical images for data augmentation. Meanwhile, federated learning enables distributed training and effectively safeguards data privacy. Nevertheless, existing approaches still face challenges regarding limited feature representation and insufficient adaptability to resource heterogeneity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified approach that integrates the Highlight Diffusion Model (HDM) with semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFedHDM). In this method, the HDM is trained locally on each client to generate highlighted features, thereby guiding the optimization of the segmentation model. On the server side, a parameter cache pool is introduced, along with version-aware strategies and a model drift synchronization mechanism, to enhance model consistency and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the Dice coefficient by 1.5% to 3.2%, while also increasing communication efficiency to 1.67 to 5 times that of synchronous federated training, thereby providing a novel paradigm for federated foundation model training in medical image segmentation.}

abstract = {Background
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) face challenges such as limited generalizability, insufficient recruitment diversity, and high failure rates, often due to restrictive eligibility criteria and inefficient patient selection. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various clinical tasks, but their potential role in RCT design remains underexplored.
Objective
This study investigates the ability of LLMs, specifically GPT-4-Turbo-Preview, to assist in designing RCTs that enhance generalizability, recruitment diversity, and reduce failure rates, while maintaining clinical safety and ethical standards.
Methods
We conducted a noninterventional, observational study analyzing 20 parallel-arm RCTs, comprising 10 completed and 10 registered studies published after January 2024 to mitigate pretraining biases. The LLM was tasked with generating RCT designs based on input criteria, including eligibility, recruitment strategies, interventions, and outcomes. The accuracy of LLM-generated designs was quantitatively assessed by 2 independent clinical experts by comparing them to clinically validated ground truth data from ClinicalTrials.gov. We have conducted statistical analysis using natural language processing–based methods, including Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)-L, and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering (METEOR), for objective scoring on corresponding LLM outputs. Qualitative assessments were performed using Likert scale ratings (1-3) for domains such as safety, clinical accuracy, objectivity or bias, pragmatism, inclusivity, and diversity.
Results
The LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 72% in replicating RCT designs. Recruitment and intervention designs demonstrated high agreement with the ground truth, achieving 88% and 93% accuracy, respectively. However, LLMs showed lower accuracy in designing eligibility criteria (55%) and outcomes measurement (53%). Natural language processing statistical analysis reported BLEU=0.04, ROUGE-L=0.20, and METEOR=0.18 on average objective scoring of LLM outputs. Qualitative evaluations showed that LLM-generated designs scored above 2 points and closely matched the original designs in scores across all domains, indicating strong clinical alignment. Specifically, both original and LLM-based designs ranked similarly high in safety, clinical accuracy, and objectivity or bias in published RCTs. Moreover, LLM-based design ranked noninferior to original designs in registered RCTs in multiple domains. In particular, LLMs enhanced diversity and pragmatism, which are key factors in improving RCT generalizability and addressing failure rates.
Conclusions
LLMs, such as GPT-4-Turbo-Preview, have demonstrated potential in improving RCT design, particularly in recruitment and intervention planning, while enhancing generalizability and addressing diversity. However, expert oversight and regulatory measures are essential to ensure patient safety and ethical standards. The findings support further integration of LLMs into clinical trial design, although continued refinement is necessary to address limitations in eligibility and outcomes measurement.}

We report a 27-year-old man with a known seizure disorder presenting with multiple daily generalized tonic–clonic seizures unresponsive to polytherapy. Examination revealed positive Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs. Laboratory tests demonstrated severe hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markedly reduced intact parathyroid hormone, consistent with primary hypoparathyroidism. Non-contrast CT head revealed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. Recent initiation of phenytoin and carbamazepine—potent enzyme inducers—aggravated hypocalcemia by accelerating vitamin D metabolism. The patient was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate, magnesium sulfate, and switched to levetiracetam. Calcium normalized within 24 h, and seizures resolved.

The oral cavity and nasopharynx are often overlooked during EGD, despite their relevance in early detection of upper aerodigestive pathologies. This video introduces a standardized, cap-assisted gastroscope technique to assess these areas during routine EGD that aims to improve anatomical recognition and opportunistic screening.
Methods
We demonstrate a cap-assisted technique using a standard gastroscope with a distal attachment to evaluate the oral cavity presedation via 4 standardized positions (tongue down, right, left, up), and the nasopharynx via retroflexion in sedated patients. Both assessments are completed within 20 seconds and recorded for educational and diagnostic value.
Results
Oral cavity assessment enables visualization of key anatomical landmarks and allows identification of mucosal abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal visualization is successful in more than 90% of cases, with clear views of structures such as the Eustachian tubes and posterior pharyngeal wall. Both techniques are safe, efficient, and reproducible, enhancing procedural scope and trainee education.
Conclusions
Cap-assisted oral cavity and nasopharynx examinations can be safely integrated into routine EGD, expanding its diagnostic reach. These standardized techniques offer educational value and potential for early lesion detection, justifying further prospective validation in high-risk populations.}

abstract = {Background
Radiology reports are typically written in a free-text format, making clinical information difficult to extract and use. Recently, the adoption of structured reporting (SR) has been recommended by various medical societies thanks to the advantages it offers, e.g. standardization, completeness, and information retrieval. We propose a pipeline to extract information from Italian free-text radiology reports that fits with the items of the reference SR registry proposed by a national society of interventional and medical radiology, focusing on CT staging of patients with lymphoma.
Methods
Our work aims to leverage the potential of Natural Language Processing and Transformer-based models to deal with automatic SR registry filling. With the availability of 174 Italian radiology reports, we investigate a rule-free generative Question Answering approach based on the Italian-specific version of T5: IT5. To address information content discrepancies, we focus on the six most frequently filled items in the annotations made on the reports: three categorical (multichoice), one free-text (free-text), and two continuous numerical (factual). In the preprocessing phase, we encode also information that is not supposed to be entered. Two strategies (batch-truncation and ex-post combination) are implemented to comply with the IT5 context length limitations. Performance is evaluated in terms of strict accuracy, f1, and format accuracy, and compared with the widely used GPT-3.5 Large Language Model. Unlike multichoice and factual, free-text answers do not have 1-to-1 correspondence with their reference annotations. For this reason, we collect human-expert feedback on the similarity between medical annotations and generated free-text answers, using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire (evaluating the criteria of correctness and completeness).
Results
The combination of fine-tuning and batch splitting allows IT5 ex-post combination to achieve notable results in terms of information extraction of different types of structured data, performing on par with GPT-3.5. Human-based assessment scores of free-text answers show a high correlation with the AI performance metrics f1 (Spearman's correlation coefficients>0.5, p-values<0.001) for both IT5 ex-post combination and GPT-3.5. The latter is better at generating plausible human-like statements, even if it systematically provides answers even when they are not supposed to be given.
Conclusions
In our experimental setting, a fine-tuned Transformer-based model with a modest number of parameters (i.e., IT5, 220 M) performs well as a clinical information extraction system for automatic SR registry filling task. It can extract information from more than one place in the report, elaborating it in a manner that complies with the response specifications provided by the SR registry (for multichoice and factual items), or that closely approximates the work of a human-expert (free-text items); with the ability to discern when an answer is supposed to be given or not to a user query.}

abstract = {Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a variably defined syndrome characterized by acute decompensation of cirrhosis with organ failures. At least 13 different definitions and diagnostic criteria for ACLF have been proposed, and there is increasing recognition that patients with ACLF may face disadvantages in the current United States liver allocation system. There is a need, therefore, for more standardized data collection and consensus to improve study design and outcome assessment in ACLF. In this article, we discuss the current landscape of transplantation for patients with ACLF, strategies to optimize organ utility, and data opportunities based on emerging technologies to facilitate improved data collection.}

Participants used ChatGPT for answering particular questions, checking information, and solving complex problems involving equations. Results show that ChatGPT lowers intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive load with very detailed responses and efficient search for information, even though it has difficulties in entering mathematical notation. Students consider that ChatGPT is a tool able to enhance understanding, engage, and promote critical thinking. These findings underline that the level of AI assistance must be balanced against independent learning and critical evaluation.}

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the use of a commercially available general large language model (LLM) in extracting and interpreting several key metrics from entire raw corneal tomography (Pentacam) reports for the diagnosis of corneal disorders.
Observation
Anonymized corneal tomography biometry reports of 50 eyes of 50 patients with healthy corneas (n = 28), keratoconus (n = 20) and post-surgical ectasia (n = 2) were analyzed by a multimodal general LLM. System prompts were used to extract flat and steep keratometry values (K1 and K2, respectively), astigmatism, pachymetry values and provide an overall diagnosis. Accuracy of data extraction was 100 % across all metrics and the model provided a diagnosis in agreement with the two observers in all eyes. Pachymetry and maximum keratometry values were the most common metric used to formulate the diagnosis and was cited in all eyes. This was followed by specifically citing the highest elevation map values (88 %) and degree of astigmatism (74 %).
Conclusion and importance
In this proof-of-concept study, a commercially available multimodal LLM was able to extract data from raw corneal tomography reports with high accuracy and with retention of spatial context, and formulated correct diagnoses with excellent proficiency. This study demonstrates the use of emerging LLMs as diagnostic adjuncts through the synthesis of multimodal data.}

abstract = {Introduction
Radial club hand is a rare congenital malformation with functional and aesthetic repercussions.
Presentation of case
We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with bilateral hand deformity, associated with hypoplasia of the thenar muscles and aplasia of the radius (Bayne stage IV). After bilateral ulnar radialisation, recovery was favorable, with stability of the hand axis and a fine grip allowing writing. At 18 months postoperatively, the child was able to integrate into school without assistance.
Discussion
Radial clubhands are rare malformations, often treated late in Madagascar due to a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, simple techniques like ulnar radialization can achieve excellent outcomes with minimal equipment.
Conclusion
Surgery remains essential, even in cases treated late.}
