abstract = {The Qinling golden snub-nosed monkey is a rare and endangered species endemic to China. Its rich facial expressions and complex social behaviors offer a valuable window into ecological research. Recently, various deep learning methods have been applied to individual identification and behavior analysis in primates, enabling preliminary automated monitoring. However, existing approaches face limitations in fine-grained feature modeling, exploiting correlations among tasks, and expressive label mapping. They struggle to effectively integrate multi-dimensional information such as identity, emotion, and gender. To address these challenges, we propose M2Emo, a multi-task recognition framework based on fine-grained Mamba and a lightweight Kolmogorov-Arnold network, for joint individual, emotion, and gender recognition in golden snub-nosed monkeys. We introduce a LocMamba module based on fine-grained Mamba to enhance the perception of local facial details, such as expressions and fur texture. We also propose a GloMamba module that strengthens global semantic representation through sequence modeling of a CLS token. Furthermore, we design a FastKAN multi-task classification head based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. It uses learnable spline basis functions to achieve efficient and decoupled mapping for multi-task labels. Importantly, we construct EmoKey, a multi-modal emotion dataset for wild primates. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong performance and good generalization in individual recognition, emotion classification, and gender identification. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LPDLG/M2Emo.}

Gastrostomy tube hypertrophic granulation tissue development, prolapse, and leakage are common problems that are often treated with tube re-siting. Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a revision technique used to enable continued use of the original tube site while removing affected tissue. The aim of this study was to describe this technique and outcomes in a series of patients requiring this intervention. The wedge gastrostomy tube site resection involves wedge excision of hypergranulation tissue or prolapsed gastric tissue and primary closure of the remaining defect. We reviewed outcomes for two children who underwent wedge gastrostomy tube site resection for medically refractory hypergranulation tissue.
Case presentation
Two patients presented with hypertrophic granulation tissue at their gastrostomy tube sites. In Case 1, the patient underwent two revisions spaced two years apart and has been symptom-free for 9 months. In Case 2, the patient required a single revision and has been symptom-free for 13 months. Neither patient had complications related to their gastrostomy tube site revision in the immediate postoperative period.
Conclusion
Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a useful strategy to remove reactive tissue that contributes to leakage around a gastrostomy tube and avoids the morbidities of tube re-siting.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are artificial intelligence programs designed to interpret and respond to text based input These programs can improve output based on prompting and tailored prompt engineering. Multiple studies have assessed the ability of various LLMs to perform on medical exams at different levels of training. The newest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4, allows image recognition which is relevant for many questions on orthopedic surgery exams. Performance of GPT-4, and the potential for LLMs to learn from prior exams remains unclear. The present study analyzed ChatGPT-4 performance on the 2023 hand surgery Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Self-Assessment Examination (SAE) before and after prompting with 5 previous versions of the test. It was hypothesized that GPT-4 would pass the exam and improve performance after prompting.
Methods
GPT-4 was tested with all text and image-based questions from the 2023 hand surgery SAE. Video-based questions were excluded. GPT-4 was then provided with questions, answers, and explanations from 5 previous SAEs from 2014 to 2020 and retested on the 2023 SAE text and imaging questions. Responses from GPT-4 on prompted and unprompted tests were recorded and compared.
Results
Both prompted and unprompted versions of ChatGPT-4 exceeded SAE exam passing requirement of >50 % correct response rate. GPT-4 answered 67 % of all questions correctly unprompted and 71 % of all questions correctly after prompting (p = 0.51). Sub-analysis demonstrated GPT-4 answered 66 % of image-based questions correctly after prompting, compared to 56 % before prompting (p = 0.25). GPT-4 answered 75 % of text only questions correctly before prompting and 74 % correctly after prompting (p = 1.0). Fischer's exact test on total questions, image only, and text only showed no statistically significant differences between prompted and unprompted versions of GPT-4.
Conclusion
GPT-4 demonstrated the ability to analyze orthopedic information, answer specialty-specific questions, and exceed the passing threshold of 50 % on the 2023 Hand Surgery Self-Assessment Exam. However, prompting GPT-4 with previous SAEs did not statistically significantly improve performance. With continued advancements in AI and deep learning, large language models may someday become resources in test simulation and knowledge checks in the realm of hand surgery.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.}

However, there are few studies that explore the latest progress and emerging challenges of AIGC across different domains. To bridge this gap, this paper brings together 16 scholars from multiple disciplines to provide a cross-domain perspective on the trends and challenges of AIGC. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) It first provides a broader overview of AIGC, spanning the training techniques of Generative AI, detection methods, and both the spread and use of AI-generated content across digital platforms. (2) It then introduces the societal impacts of AIGC across diverse domains, along with a review of existing methods employed in these contexts. (3) Finally, it discusses the key technical challenges and presents research propositions to guide future work. Through these contributions, this vision paper seeks to offer readers a cross-domain perspective on AIGC, providing insights into its current research trends, ongoing challenges, and future directions.}

abstract = {Introduction
We are currently developing a cell classification system intended for routine histopathology. During observation, cells of interest are added to a deep learning (DL) network, which after training classifies the remaining cells of interest with high and immediately validatable accuracy. In this study, we identify the optimal histological microsection thickness for this process and describe in high detail the morphological differences introduced by variation in microsection thickness.
Method
From HE-stained digitized sections of liver cut manually at 5 thicknesses and on an automated microtome (DS), hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were manually annotated and loaded into a DL convolutional neural network (ResNet). The network was trained at different settings to identify the thickness with optimal relation between number of training cells and validation accuracy. To shed interpretable light on the impact of thickness, exhaustive morphological details of the annotated cells were quantified and the differences between hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were analyzed with random forest.
Results
Classifying hepatocytes from DS sections clearly resulted in highest validation accuracy with least number of cells and for the remaining thicknesses a trend towards thin sections being more efficient was observed. Random forest analysis generally identified variations in nuclear granularity as the most important features in distinguishing cells. In DS and the thinner tissue sections, nuclear granularity features were more distinguished.
Conclusion
Microsections cut with DS in particular and thin sections in general are better suited for the intended cell classification system.}

The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2nd among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.}

Consumer search behavior is a key topic in marketing, economics, and psychology. Across fields, distinct research traditions have emerged, each with its own foundational assumptions and data requirements. Some of these differences stem from conflicting assumptions (e.g., search is Bayesian optimal vs heuristic) while others arise from contextual factors (e.g., search in a visual space vs search in memory). This article proposes an agenda for comparing and extending models of consumer search to support practitioners and researchers in selecting, applying, and refining these models. Ultimately, this may contribute to a more integrated understanding of consumer search. We review five prominent theoretical models, each with distinct terminologies. For each model, we review its background, aims, core assumptions, and provide illustrative examples. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we initiate a synthesis aimed at resolving terminological differences and propose an agenda for model comparison, extension, and integration; and (2) we identify opportunities for future research to advance a more comprehensive understanding of consumer search and choice.}

Among 3024 rectal swabs from 699 patients, 503 of 3024 (16.6%) tested positive for MDR-GNB in 192 of 699 patients (27.5%). The most prevalent organisms were Escherichia coli (248/503; 49.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae complex (125/503; 24.9%), and P. aeruginosa (36/503; 7.2%). A total of 59 of 503 (11.7%) colonizations of CRE were identified. Overall, 27 of 192 (14.1%) patients were colonized at admission, primarily by 3GCephRE (27/29; 93.1%). Colonization with CRE and DTR P. aeruginosa was more frequently documented after several days of hospitalization. BSI occurred in 74 of 192 (38.5%) colonized and 61 of 507 (12.0%) non-colonized patients. MDR-GNB caused 57 of 166 BSIs episodes, 50 of 57 (87.7%) of which were in colonized patients. The unadjusted concordance rate between rectal swab isolates and blood cultures was observed in 43 of 90 BSIs (47.8%) occurring in colonized patients, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 36.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.9% for DTR P. aeruginosa; a PPV of 25.0% and an NPV of 99.9% for CRE; and a PPV of 14.6% and an NPV of 99.0% for 3GCephRE.
Discussion
Routine weekly surveillance for MDR-GNB in haematological patients enables early identification of colonization, often preceding MDR-GNB BSIs. Further studies using adjusted analyses are needed to establish its independent predictive value.}

Recognizing its importance, the World Health Organization has prioritized eliminating taeniasis/cysticercosis by 2030, designating it as a priority neglected tropical disease (NTD). Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective disease control, yet traditional methods often fall short due to low sensitivity of the test and the need for specialized laboratory setups. This study focuses on developing a recombinant Ag2 (rAg2)-based dot blot assay to detect T. solium cysticercosis in pigs. The rAg2 antigen was successfully expressed and purified, with immunoreactivity confirmed against sera from naturally infected pigs. The dot blot test evaluated against serological gold-standard enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot (EITB) assay, demonstrated preliminary laboratory sensitivity (89 %, 95 % CI: 68.6–97.1) and specificity (100 %, 95 % CI: 97.6 - 100), highlighting its potential as a reliable alternative diagnostic method. Cost-effectiveness and minimal laboratory requirements make it particularly suited for field use in resource-limited settings.}

abstract = {Purpose
Successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) relies on proper ligament balancing with a focus on medial stability. Intra-operative evaluation of the medial flexion gap must account for the relative femur–tibia positioning after implant placement. This study investigated whether intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial gap, enabled by a simple, reproducible spacer block for precise flexion gap measurement, could achieve consistent medial gap matching in both extension and flexion.
Methods
Forty-seven patients (9 men, 38 women) with knee osteoarthritis underwent JOURNEY II bicruciate stabilized TKA. A spacer block simulating post-cam engagement was designed to accurately assess the medial flexion gap. Intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial flexion gap was performed using spacer blocks and a stepless femoral cutting guide. Gaps were measured during the component trial using a tension device and at 1 year post-operatively via stress radiographs.
Results
Initially, 29% of knees exhibited a flexion–extension gap difference ≥2 ​mm after posterior cruciate ligament resection and tibial osteotomy. Spacer block fine-tuning reduced this to 8% and this improvement persisted at 1 year. At 4 years follow-up, Knee Society Scores were favorable, with significant gains in extension and flexion angles.
Conclusion
The developed spacer block technique, which replicates the post-cam engaging position, provided consistent and accurate flexion gap measurements and reduced flexion–extension discrepancies. This approach enhanced knee stability and patient outcome post-TKA.}

Pediatric patients with sustained tachyarrhythmias present unique challenges to prehospital clinicians due to differences in physiology, pathology, compensatory mechanisms, and treatment algorithms. Additionally, pediatric patients require careful thought into the psychosocial impacts that one's demeanor, treatment, and explanations will have on them.
Case report
This case illustrates an adolescent male with a history of Chiari 1 malformation who presented to EMS with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). An unusual rhythm response was experienced during electrical cardioversion, where this intervention resulted in an immediate doubling of his heart rate.
Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?
We discuss approaches to pediatric dysrhythmias, differential diagnosis considerations, appropriate management of wide-complex tachycardia, and methods to reduce the psychological burden on patients and families in a first-encounter clinical situation.}

abstract = {Objective
Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is advisable to promote better prognosis. The Mini-TEA scale was conceived as a sensitive screening for ASD among children. The authors aimed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in a wider population.
Method
279 children from 2.5 to 12 yo were recruited, most of them under evaluation for possible ASD in the APAE of Passo Fundo/RS, as well as children with other diagnoses and normal children. Their parents/relatives answered the 48 binary questions (yes/no) of the Mini-TEA scale, divided into 15 items, which resulted in a score from 0 to 15. After that, the children were evaluated regarding the diagnostic criteria of ASD by experienced raters (gold standard) who had previously submitted to a concordance test and remained unaware of the children’s scores. Sensitivity and specificity Figs. were obtained. Factor analysis and Item Response Theory approaches were used for validity evidence.
Results
115 children were diagnosed with ASD. Scores ≥9 had 98.3 % of sensitivity and 62.2 % of specificity for the diagnosis. Two cases with the typical presentation of Asperger’s syndrome scored lower than 9. The mean time for screening was about 8.5 min. The validation model presented excellent coefficients of factorability. The analysis showed that the total variance of the scores of the scale through the 15 items was explained only by the set of ASD symptoms (unidimensionality).
Conclusion
The Mini-TEA scale is a very sensitive tool to screen for ASD and has high internal consistency for assessing typical autistic symptoms.}

In addition, diversified questions with different difficulty levels and cognitive development levels for specific domain knowledge are highly demanded for evaluation and training purposes. To fulfill these needs, this study proposes a hybrid system utilizing prompt engineering techniques to address several challenges, including the lack of defined structured knowledge components, the limitation of questions to single relationships between knowledge components, and the lack of diversity in question difficulty levels and cognitive development levels. To address these challenges, we leveraged the capabilities of Tree of Thought prompting (ToT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to propose a system called Smart Knowledge with questions and answers (SKQA), which can be applied across various courses. SKQA is designed to automatically generate structured KCs with multiple relationships and create diverse question-answer datasets by leveraging these structured KCs. To illustrate the capabilities of SKQA, the course Fundamentals of Database Systems (FDS) is adopted as an example to demonstrate how our proposed system generates seven structured knowledge component groups with multiple relationships, which is significantly better than other related datasets. Moreover, SKQA generates more than 1000 pairs of questions and answers at varying levels of difficulty and cognitive development. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that our system has strong potential in generating structured knowledge components and high-quality, diverse question-answer pairs based on the relationships among KCs. While we highlight its application in the Fundamentals of Database Systems course, SKQA is broadly applicable to various subjects and domains (e.g., Operating Systems), showcasing its general utility and adaptability.

The risk of drug interactions in patients with HTN is aggravated when prescribing treatments for additional acute pathologies. This can favor adverse reactions to medications or make it difficult to control blood pressure during their stay in the emergency room.
Objective
Identify and classify, using CDSS, the IFFs between the antihypertensive treatment regimen and the drugs prescribed in the emergency department.
Material and methods
Fifty-three patients with systemic arterial hypertension were treated in the emergency department. Clinical decision support systems are used to identify and classify potential FFs.
Results
IFFs were found in 96.2% of hypertensive patients in the emergency department. Those with the highest frequency were of moderate risk. The most frequent mechanism was pharmacodynamic, mainly synergistic by ad-dition.
Conclusions
The correlation index between the number of drugs prescribed in the emer-gency room and the presence of IFF shows the need to carry out a scrutiny of the joint pharmaco-logical behavior used in hypertensive patients who attend emergency medical care to rationalize the use of medications reducing the probability of presenting IFF.
Résumé
Le risque d’interactions médicamenteuses chez les patients hypertendus est aggravé lors de la prescription de traitements pour des pathologies aiguës supplémentaires. Cela peut favoriser les réactions indésirables aux médicaments ou rendre difficile le contrôle de la pression artérielle pendant leur séjour au service des urgences.
Objectif
Identifier et classifier, à l’aide du système d’aide à la décision clinique (CDSS), les IFF entre le schéma de traitement antihypertenseur et les médicaments prescrits au service des urgences.
Matériels et méthodes
Cinquante-trois patients souffrant d’hypertension artérielle systémique ont été traités au service des urgences. Les systèmes d’aide à la décision clinique sont utilisés pour identifier et classifier les IFF potentiels.
Résultats
Des IFF ont été trouvées chez 96,2 % des patients hypertendus au service des urgences. Ceux de fréquence la plus élevée étaient de risque modéré. Le mécanisme le plus fréquent était pharmacodynamique, principalement synergique par addition.
Conclusion
L’indice de corrélation entre le nombre de médicaments prescrits au service des urgences et la présence d’IFF montre la nécessité d’effectuer un examen du comportement pharmacologique conjoint utilisé chez les patients hypertendus qui se présentent aux soins médicaux d’urgence pour rationaliser l’utilisation des médicaments et réduire la probabilité de présenter des IFF.}

Several benefits were recognized from the use of Gen-AI in business context, mainly resolution of complex situations and operational improvement of processes. At the optimization level, industry players perceived Gen-AI with more potential than academicians. Advantages of Gen-AI were identified as strongly aligned with data quality. Both academicians and industry players highlight difficulty of identification, collection, and update of relevant data, together with the needed parsimony in decision-making about Gen-AI-produced results. This study corroborates the current awareness of scarcity in trained people to explore the full potential of Gen-AI and highlights the resistance towards its adoption by top management, especially in SMEs, which due to their scale may lack structured data and act more risk averse.}

This has created the need for transformative change in the agricultural sector, with soil health playing a key role in this transition. Soil health is essential for agricultural productivity, economic viability, and ecosystem resilience, while also advancing sustainability and inclusivity. Achieving these outcomes depends on effective soil management, but slow growth in fertilizer use and limited understanding of its efficiency by farmers pose significant challenges. The Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit (Nairobi, May 2024) underscored the urgency of these challenges, endorsing the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan. This commentary outlines key considerations for successful implementation of the plan, highlighting enabling conditions and strategic approaches: (1) trusted multi-sectoral partnerships fostering collaboration among farmers, governments, private companies, non-governmental organisations, and donors, (2) demand-driven research and development with strong focus on measurable development outcomes, (3) targeted investments and finance effectively expanding the role of the private sector, (4) effective policy mandates relying on comprehensive policy mixes, and (5) inclusive capacity-building using gender-transformative approaches. These strategic contributions are essential to achieving sustainable, equitable agricultural transformation in Africa. The transformation will demand innovation, long-term commitment, and coordinated action across sectors to ensure impact beyond the timeframe of the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan.}

Through two experimental and one qualitative interview studies, the findings reveal two distinct pathways: from an intuitive system perspective, AI hallucination enhances narrative transportation of destination stories, thus increasing tourists' interest-type curiosity and ultimately promoting cultural contact. From an analytical system perspective, AI hallucination triggers cognitive dissonance, heightening deprivation-type curiosity and subsequently fostering greater cultural contact. Moreover, AI literacy negatively moderates the intuitive pathway while positively moderating the analytical pathway. Additionally, AI hallucination that exhibits a prototype matching with destination culture is particularly effective in encouraging tourists’ cultural contact. This study challenges previous criticisms of AI hallucination by highlighting their potential in enhancing cultural narrative dissemination for destinations. The findings provide valuable insights for tourism businesses aiming to leverage AI effectively for cultural promotion.}

The modifications led to a 4–5 % increase in pitch and roll inertia of the platform. The maximum acceleration at the nacelle increased by less than 10 %, remaining within acceptable limits, and the maximum power output changed by less than 2 % across all load cases. Mooring line tensions increased by approximately 3 %, demonstrating minimal impact on overall stability. The study demonstrates that onboard hydrogen integration can be achieved without compromising the dynamic response or energy production performance of the floating platform, supporting its viability as a decentralized offshore hydrogen production solution.}

abstract = {T1N0 non-small cell lung cancers account for about 20 % of all lung cancer cases and are defined as tumours up to 3cm without nodal or distant metastasis. The incidence of early-stage diagnoses is increasing, largely driven by the implementation of low dose computed tomography screening programs. Surgery has long been considered the standard of care for these tumours, offering excellent oncologic outcomes and allowing essential pathological staging. However, surgery may be indicated or poorly tolerated in certain populations, particularly elderly or medically inoperable patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy has emerged as a non-invasive alternative with high local control rates and reduced early morbidity. This raises a critical question: should all patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer be managed surgically, or is there a role for treatment individualization? Current evidence highlights the need of balancing curative intent with treatment-related risks. Several clinical trials are currently evaluating stereotactic body radiotherapy in operable patients, aiming to identify subsets that may derive benefit from a non-surgical approach. This review advocates for a personalized, patient-centred treatment strategy, integrating tumour characteristics, operability, comorbidities, and patient preference.
Résumé
Le cancer bronchique non à petites cellules de stade T1N0 représente environ 20 % des cancers du poumon et correspond à des tumeurs de taille inférieure ou égale à 3cm sans atteinte ganglionnaire ni métastase à distance. La fréquence des diagnostics à un stade précoce est en augmentation grâce à la généralisation du dépistage par scanographie thoracique. Traditionnellement, la chirurgie constitue le traitement de référence, offrant des taux de guérison élevés ainsi qu’un accès indispensable au bilan histopathologique complet. Toutefois, elle n’est pas toujours indiquée, notamment chez les patients âgés ou fragiles. La radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques s’est imposée comme une alternative, avec des taux de contrôle local élevés et une morbidité aiguë moindre. Cette évolution soulève une question essentielle : tous les patients doivent-ils être opérés, ou un traitement personnalisé est-il envisageable ? Les données actuelles soulignent la nécessité de concilier l’intention curative avec le risque de morbidité. Plusieurs essais cliniques explorent actuellement l’utilisation de la radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques chez des patients opérables, dans le but d’identifier des sous-groupes susceptibles d’en tirer bénéfice. Cet article plaide en faveur d’une approche individualisée et centrée sur le patient, intégrant les caractéristiques tumorales, l’opérabilité, la comorbidité et les préférences du patient.}

keywords = {Anterior glottic web—KTP laser—Awake procedures},
abstract = {Objective
Acquired anterior glottic webs are the result of trauma, iatrogenic, radiation, or inflammation to the anterior commissure, resulting in narrowing of the airway and elevated pitch. They are very challenging to treat, and contemporary management strategies typically involve repeat procedures under general anesthesia with high rates of web recurrence. We aim to describe a novel treatment for anterior glottic webs with potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser treatment that are performed in-office under topical anesthesia.
Methods
This is a retrospective chart review of six patients with an anterior glottic web who were managed in an office setting with KTP laser between the years 2019 and 2023. Demographic data, patient reported outcome measures, and treatment details were collected. Preprocedure and postprocedure video laryngoscopy was collected, and representative images were evaluated by blinded laryngologists. The reviewer, blinded to treatment status, was asked to measure the length of the vocal fold from vocal process to current anterior commissure and in addition, measure vocal process to expected ideal anterior commissure. The percentage change in length of the anterior glottic web is then calculated and reported.
Results
Six patients were included in the study, all tolerated the procedure well, and no adverse events. Patient follow up was on average 7 months (5 weeks to 3.1 years), with three of six patients having approximately 3 years follow up. All patients had a reduction in the length of the anterior glottic web, with an average pretreatment web length 40.4%, falling to 15.4% postKTP; t(6) = 3.43, 95%CI [6.29-43.71], P < 0.05. There were no significant change in VHI-10 scores post treatment t(3) = 1.73, 95% CI [−2.93−9.93].
Conclusions
KTP is a novel in-office treatment that offers promising and potentially durable results in the management of anterior glottic web.

To help support the ongoing development of qualitative research we attend to interviewing, story completion, analysis, computer-assisted software, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital methods. The paper also provides a note on physical activity guidelines, qualitative research, and policy-making. It closes by reaffirming the need to approach qualitative research as a slow craft that involves people (not AI) making tough, well-thought-out ethical, theoretical, and methodological decisions.}

Findings
The column reinforces several crucial points. First, understanding how these systems create experiences that feel intelligent, authoritative and engaging even when they are none of these things becomes more critical as these systems become more compelling and ubiquitous. Second, a role in helping users navigate this landscape while maintaining critical thinking about sources and authority is not diminishing, but becoming more essential, even if it is increasingly challenging to see how users understand this value is ensured. Finally, the need for scenario planning and flexible thinking about AI’s future applications has only grown as the technology’s unpredictability has been repeatedly demonstrated.

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an extremely rare sarcoma mainly reported in the lung. The adrenal gland, however, is an extremely rare site of occurrence. Herein, we report a case of a large adrenal mass with no contributory imaging features presenting a challenging pathological diagnosis.
Case presentation
A healthy 32-year-old male patient, with no personal nor family history, presented with loss of body weight and condition developing for two months. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities with a soft and depressible abdomen and absence of palpable lump. Circulating Chromogranin A and catecholamine metabolites were within normal range. The preoperative imaging features were noncontributory. The pathological examination on biopsy specimen concluded to a spindle cell proliferation set in a chronically inflamed background suggesting the diagnosis of IMT. The patient, subsequently, underwent radical nephrectomy unveiling a 25 cm adrenal mass. Pathological findings on resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis of IMT of the left adrenal gland.
Clinical discussion
Due to their rarity in the adrenal gland and their noncontributory radiological features, IMTs are typically not considered as a potential diagnosis in this location. As a result, this condition is often underdiagnosed. In this setting, suspicion for IMT should be raised when spindle cell histology is observed.
Conclusion
It is fundamental for practicians to keep this entity in mind as the treatment consists of complete tumor extirpation. The latter being the only guarantee of recurrence free follow up.}

abstract = {Background: Neuromyths are widespread among educators, which raises concerns about misconceptions regarding the (neural) principles underlying learning in the educator population. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, educators are increasingly relying on these for lesson planning and professional development. Therefore, if LLMs correctly identify neuromyths, they may help to dispute related misconceptions. Method: We evaluated whether LLMs can correctly identify neuromyths and whether they may hint educators to neuromyths in applied contexts when users ask questions comprising related misconceptions. Additionally, we examined whether explicitly prompting LLMs to base their answer on scientific evidence or to correct unsupported assumptions would decrease errors in identifying neuromyths. Results: LLMs outperformed humans in identifying neuromyth statements as used in previous studies. However, when presented with applied user-like questions comprising misconceptions, they struggled to highlight or dispute these. Interestingly, explicitly asking LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions increased the likelihood that misconceptions were flagged considerably, while prompting the models to rely on scientific evidence had only little effects. Conclusion: While LLMs outperformed humans at identifying isolated neuromyth statements, they struggled to hint users towards the same misconception when they were included in more applied user-like questions—presumably due to LLMs’ tendency toward sycophantic responses. This limitation suggests that, despite their potential, LLMs are not yet a reliable safeguard against the spread of neuromyths in educational settings. However, when users explicitly prompt LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions—an approach that may initially seem counterintuitive–this effectively reduced sycophantic responses.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming musculoskeletal research, offering new approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and patient management in osteoarthritis (OA). However, implementation and ethical challenges persist. This manuscript summarizes insights from the OARSI 2025 Pre-Congress Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Osteoarthritis Research, highlighting opportunities and challenges in applying AI across biomechanics, imaging, and clinical research domains.
Design
The workshop, organized by the OARSI Early Career Investigator Committee and co-chaired by Drs. Matthew Harkey and Brooke Patterson, convened experts to discuss the use of AI in real-world biomechanics data collection, radiomics for imaging-based biomarkers, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and research applications. Emphasis was placed on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical oversight.
Results
In biomechanics, AI-driven markerless motion capture and wearable sensors enable scalable, ecologically valid data collection, though issues such as class imbalance, data privacy, and model interpretability remain. In imaging, radiomics and deep learning models show promise for early OA detection and progression prediction but face challenges in domain adaptation and external validation. In clinical research, LLMs can streamline documentation and thematic analysis but must address concerns around bias, data security, and transparency. Across domains, transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of AI were emphasized as critical for maintaining scientific rigor.
Conclusions
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and AI literacy are essential to responsibly advance AI integration in OA research. The workshop's collective insights call for ethical, patient-centered approaches that leverage AI's strengths while preserving research integrity and trust.}

The structural equation modeling is a path analysis method based on the factor analysis and linear regression, which can be used to analyze the path relationship between intricate variables.

abstract = {Background
Urate is the final product of purine catabolism, and its levels have been linked to various cardiometabolic disorders. In Mexico, most epidemiological data on urate levels derive from populations with existing comorbidities, limiting the establishment of normative reference values.
Objective
To characterize the distribution of serum urate concentrations in a healthy adult population residing in Mexico City.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 3099 healthy adults (64.6% women) enrolled in the Tlalpan 2020 cohort. Participants with chronic diseases, abnormal blood pressure or glucose levels, or exposure to urate-altering medications were excluded. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were recorded, and serum urate concentrations were analyzed overall and stratified by sex.
Results
The median serum urate level in the overall cohort was 5.16mg/dL (interquartile range, 4.32–6.15), with a central 95% reference interval ranging from 3.05 to 7.98mg/dL. Median urate levels differed significantly by sex: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) in women and 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) in men. The prevalence of hyperuricemia in the total cohort was 16.5%, notably higher in men (28.4%) compared to women (10.0%).
Conclusion
This study establishes sex-specific reference values for serum urate in a healthy Mexican adult population. The findings may inform clinical decision-making and future research on urate-related risk stratification.
Resumen
Antecedentes
El urato es el producto final del catabolismo de las purinas y su concentración se ha asociado con diversos trastornos cardiometabólicos. En México, la mayoría de los datos epidemiológicos sobre los niveles de urato provienen de poblaciones con comorbilidades existentes, lo que limita el establecimiento de valores de referencia normativos.
Objetivo
Caracterizar la distribución de las concentraciones séricas de urato en una población adulta sana residente en la Ciudad de México.
Métodos
Se realizó un análisis transversal utilizando datos de 3,099 adultos sanos (64.6% mujeres) incluidos en la cohorte Tlalpan 2020. Se excluyeron participantes con enfermedades crónicas, cifras anormales de presión arterial o glucosa, o exposición a medicamentos que alteran el urato. Se registraron parámetros clínicos, antropométricos y bioquímicos, y las concentraciones de urato se analizaron de forma global y estratificadas por sexo.
Resultados
La mediana de urato sérico en la cohorte fue de 5.16mg/dL (rango intercuartílico: 4.32–6.15), con un intervalo de referencia (95%) que oscila entre 3.05 y 7.98mg/dL. Las concentraciones de urato difirieron significativamente por sexo: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) en mujeres y 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) en hombres. La prevalencia de hiperuricemia en la cohorte total fue de 16.5%, siendo mayor en hombres (28.4%) que en mujeres (10.0%).
Conclusión
Este estudio establece valores de referencia de urato específicos por sexo en una población mexicana adulta sana. Los hallazgos pueden ser útiles para la toma de decisiones y para futuras investigaciones sobre la estratificación del riesgo relacionado con el urato.}

abstract = {Mural sketches reveal both the content and structure of the murals and are crucial for the preservation of murals. However, existing methods lack robustness, making it difficult to suppress noise while preserving sketches on damaged murals and fully capturing details on clear murals. To address this, we propose a Data Uncertainty-Driven Robust Network (DURN) for mural sketch detection. DURN uses uncertainty to quantify noise in the murals, converting prediction into a learnable normal distribution, where the mean represents the sketch and the variance denotes the uncertainty. This enables the model to learn both the sketch and the noise simultaneously, achieving noise suppression while preserving the sketches. To enhance sketches, we design an Adaptive Fusion Feature Enhancement Module (AFFE) to dynamically adjust the fusion strategy according to the contribution of features at different scales and reduce the information loss caused by feature dimensionality reduction to maximize the utility of each feature. We develop a novel Deep-Shallow Supervision (DSS) module to mitigate background noise using deep semantic information to guide shallow features without adding parameters. Additionally, we achieve model lightweighting through pruning techniques, ensuring competitive performance while reducing the number of parameters to only 4.5 % of the original. The experimental results show an improvement of 10. 4 % AP over existing methods, demonstrating the robustness of DURN for complex and damaged murals.

To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of mange mites in small ruminants within the Sodo Zuria and Humbo districts of the Wolaita zone, a cross-sectional study employing systematic random sampling was conducted between October 2024 and March 2025. Out of 246 animals examined, 10.16 % (25/246) were found to be infected with mange mites, with goats showing a prevalence of 14.40 % (18 out of 125) and sheep at 5.79 % (7 out of 121). The results indicated a higher infection rate among adult animals (12.16 %) compared to younger ones (7.14 %), and those from lowland areas (16 %) faced a greater prevalence than animals from highland regions (4.13 %). Significant statistical relationships (p < 0.05) were identified between the occurrence of mange mites and various factors, including environmental conditions, age, body site, and management practices. Among the different species of mites identified, Sarcoptes was the most common, accounting for 6.91 % of cases. This research highlights an escalating health threat posed by mites to small ruminants in the area, underscoring the urgent need for intervention strategies. It also stresses the importance of targeted acaricide applications and enhanced management practices in high-risk lowland agro-ecological zones.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive assessment is an important component of applied psychology, but limited access and high costs make these evaluations challenging.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized artificial intelligence–based verbal comprehension tests (AI-BVCTs) for assessing verbal intelligence, in contrast with traditional assessment methods based on standardized norms.
Methods
We used a within-participants design, comparing scores obtained from AI-BVCTs with those from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) verbal comprehension index (VCI). In total, 8 Hebrew-speaking participants completed both the VCI and AI-BVCT, the latter being generated using the LLM Claude.
Results
The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) demonstrated strong agreement between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (Claude: CCC=.75, 90% CI 0.266-0.933; GPT-4: CCC=.73, 90% CI 0.170-0.935). Pearson correlations further supported these findings, showing strong associations between VCI and AI-BVCT scores (Claude: r=.84, P<.001; GPT-4: r=.77, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (P>.05).
Conclusions
These findings support the potential of LLMs to assess verbal intelligence. The study attests to the promise of AI-based cognitive tests in increasing the accessibility and affordability of assessment processes, enabling personalized testing. The research also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and overreliance on AI in clinical work. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to establish the validity and reliability of this approach and develop more accurate scoring procedures.}

keywords = {Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), Generative Artificial Intelligence, Technology adoption, Entrepreneurial support, Librarians},
abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a revolutionary force in the constantly evolving technology landscape, transforming many industries, including libraries. Libraries have been focusing on experimenting with emerging AI technologies to innovate their services, especially for supporting entrepreneurs. Generative AI, for instance, ChatGPT, holds immense potential for libraries by enabling them to provide advanced support to entrepreneurs, for instance, meeting the business needs of the entrepreneurs, or strengthening entrepreneurial education programs. By concentrating on the adoption of generative AI, librarians will be encouraged to experiment and use their expertise in current generative AI technologies to test out future ones and adopt the more useful ones.
Method and analysis
The objective of the research is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of ChatGPT technology by librarians in their provision of support for entrepreneurs. The research aims to provide insights that can help formulate the strategies for the successful adoption of ChatGPT technology in library settings to enhance their support for entrepreneurs. To achieve the research objective, the research study adopts a correlational research design that will empirically test the hypothesis- the relationship between latent variables affecting the three stages of technology adoption. Surveys will be administered to librarians actively engaged in assisting entrepreneurs, aiming to capture data on various factors influencing their adoption decisions, and hence aiding in empirical validation of the formulated hypothesis. Before commencing data collection, participants will be provided with a detailed informed consent sheet outlining the research's purpose, procedures involved, the voluntary nature of the participation, and potential risks involved. Only after participants have explicitly provided their consent are they granted access to the survey questionnaire. This ensures transparency and ethical compliance throughout the research process. To safeguard participant confidentiality and maintain data integrity, all research data will be securely stored in password-protected cloud storage platforms, such as University OneDrive. Strict data handling protocols will be followed, with access limited to authorized research team members. Moreover, participants' personal information will not be collected, ensuring anonymity and privacy. Stringent quality assurance measures will be implemented to ensure the reliability and validity of the research findings. Before survey administration, a pilot test will be conducted to refine the survey instrument and identify any ambiguities. The pilot testing will adhere to ethical guidelines and principles, including the mandatory nature of informed consent, as well as protocols for data storage, handling procedures, and safety considerations outlined for the main research study. Continuous monitoring and peer review processes will be employed to mitigate individual biases and errors, thereby enhancing the overall robustness of the research outcomes. Data cleaning procedures, including outlier detection and imputation techniques, will further reinforce the integrity and completeness of the dataset. Additionally, member checking with participants will ensure the accuracy and alignment of research interpretations with participants' perspectives, bolstering the credibility of the study findings. Through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the collected data will undergo rigorous analysis using the SmartPLS 4 software version, validating the complex relationships between different constructs of the theoretical model.
Discussion
The research will have both theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, it seeks to identify factors influencing ChatGPT adoption among librarians supporting entrepreneurs, enriching our understanding of technology adoption dynamics in library services. Practically, the findings offer actionable insights for librarians, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders supporting innovation. By uncovering adoption drivers and barriers, librarians can develop dynamic capabilities to experiment with emerging AI technologies, foster co-creation with patrons, and thereby strengthen entrepreneur support services. The results will also have greater implications for the countries where libraries are yet to be positioned as innovation actor supporting entrepreneurship.}

This lopsided dispensation has persisted as an enigma to be solved. Thus, a hypothesis is raised here that the Black Death, a plague pandemic caused by Yersinia pestis, which ravaged Europe in the fourteenth century and brought on a severe human extermination constituted the pathogenic selective pressure for factor V Leiden of which the procoagulative, anti-fibrinlolysis function, and the resultant resistance potential to Yersinia pestis infection have been demonstrated in a series of animal experiments and clinical observation. The same explanation is also proposed for a similar unbalanced distribution of prothrombin G20210A mutation, another thrombophilia genetic variant, between Caucasians and Asians despite awaiting more solid evidence in the near future. On the other hand, the fact that deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin had not risen during the plague disaster is theoretically attributed to more severe and fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with the dysfunction of them. The whole assumption implies an underlying evolutionary advantage of factor V Leiden and a mysterious relationship between genetic traits and diseases. It is hoped that future investigations dedicating to analysis of ancient DNA from human remains in the medieval cemeteries before, during, and after the plague will finally let the speculation come true.}

This systematic literature review analyzes the current status, challenges, and future directions for combining these technologies in the coffee sector. Following the PRISMA protocol, 455 papers were reviewed in six scientific databases, identifying 27 primary studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis reveals a significant increase in research activity since 2020, with a relationship between time and frequency of publication. Machine learning techniques, particularly regression analysis and random forests, emerged as the predominant artificial intelligence approaches for multispectral data processing. The review identified several key applications, such as coffee quality assessment, disease detection, and yield prediction. However, significant challenges remain, such as limited biometric variability within coffee plants, the influence of environmental factors, and the need for high-quality training data. The effectiveness of these technologies varies across geographic regions and soil and climatic conditions, underscoring the importance of application in specific contexts. Future research points toward the development of more robust artificial intelligence models, the integration of multiple data sources, and the need to employ hybrid artificial intelligence approaches. This review provides an understanding of the current landscape and valuable information for researchers, industry professionals, and stakeholders interested in creating more efficient and sustainable coffee farming practices using these technologies.}

To assess the clinical reasoning capabilities of two large language models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0, compared to those of neonatal nurses during neonatal care scenarios.
Design
A cross-sectional study with a comparative evaluation using a survey instrument that included six neonatal intensive care unit clinical scenarios.
Participants
32 neonatal intensive care nurses with 5–10 years of experience working in the neonatal intensive care units of three medical centers.
Methods
Participants responded to 6 written clinical scenarios. Simultaneously, we asked ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 to provide initial assessments and treatment recommendations for the same scenarios. The responses from ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 were then scored by certified neonatal nurse practitioners for accuracy, completeness, and response time.
Results
Both models demonstrated capabilities in clinical reasoning for neonatal care, with Claude-2.0 significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4 in clinical accuracy and speed. However, limitations were identified across the cases in diagnostic precision, treatment specificity, and response lag.
Conclusions
While showing promise, current limitations reinforce the need for deep refinement before ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 can be considered for integration into clinical practice. Additional validation of these tools is important to safely leverage this Artificial Intelligence technology for enhancing clinical decision-making.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

abstract = {Background
Urate is the final product of purine catabolism, and its levels have been linked to various cardiometabolic disorders. In Mexico, most epidemiological data on urate levels derive from populations with existing comorbidities, limiting the establishment of normative reference values.
Objective
To characterize the distribution of serum urate concentrations in a healthy adult population residing in Mexico City.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 3099 healthy adults (64.6% women) enrolled in the Tlalpan 2020 cohort. Participants with chronic diseases, abnormal blood pressure or glucose levels, or exposure to urate-altering medications were excluded. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were recorded, and serum urate concentrations were analyzed overall and stratified by sex.
Results
The median serum urate level in the overall cohort was 5.16mg/dL (interquartile range, 4.32–6.15), with a central 95% reference interval ranging from 3.05 to 7.98mg/dL. Median urate levels differed significantly by sex: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) in women and 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) in men. The prevalence of hyperuricemia in the total cohort was 16.5%, notably higher in men (28.4%) compared to women (10.0%).
Conclusion
This study establishes sex-specific reference values for serum urate in a healthy Mexican adult population. The findings may inform clinical decision-making and future research on urate-related risk stratification.
Resumen
Antecedentes
El urato es el producto final del catabolismo de las purinas y su concentración se ha asociado con diversos trastornos cardiometabólicos. En México, la mayoría de los datos epidemiológicos sobre los niveles de urato provienen de poblaciones con comorbilidades existentes, lo que limita el establecimiento de valores de referencia normativos.
Objetivo
Caracterizar la distribución de las concentraciones séricas de urato en una población adulta sana residente en la Ciudad de México.
Métodos
Se realizó un análisis transversal utilizando datos de 3,099 adultos sanos (64.6% mujeres) incluidos en la cohorte Tlalpan 2020. Se excluyeron participantes con enfermedades crónicas, cifras anormales de presión arterial o glucosa, o exposición a medicamentos que alteran el urato. Se registraron parámetros clínicos, antropométricos y bioquímicos, y las concentraciones de urato se analizaron de forma global y estratificadas por sexo.
Resultados
La mediana de urato sérico en la cohorte fue de 5.16mg/dL (rango intercuartílico: 4.32–6.15), con un intervalo de referencia (95%) que oscila entre 3.05 y 7.98mg/dL. Las concentraciones de urato difirieron significativamente por sexo: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) en mujeres y 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) en hombres. La prevalencia de hiperuricemia en la cohorte total fue de 16.5%, siendo mayor en hombres (28.4%) que en mujeres (10.0%).
Conclusión
Este estudio establece valores de referencia de urato específicos por sexo en una población mexicana adulta sana. Los hallazgos pueden ser útiles para la toma de decisiones y para futuras investigaciones sobre la estratificación del riesgo relacionado con el urato.}

abstract = {Introduction
Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a rare condition in athletes and musicians who perform repeated prolonged forced gripping movements. It mainly affects young men, and presents with cramp-like pain, beginning on the anteromedial side of the forearm and progressively extending to the entire circumference, and may be associated with muscle weakness and neurologic symptoms. The objective of this study was to report preliminary results of ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
Material and methods
A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome was diagnosed on clinical presentation and pathological intramuscular pressure measurement, defined as >30 mmHg at 1 min after effort. The series comprised 7 men, with bilateral involvement. Mean age was 30 years. All patients were motorcyclists. The mean preoperative intramuscular pressure at 1 min after effort was 60.75 mmHg (range: 30−81 mmHg). The main study endpoint was change in pain on visual analogic scale. Secondary endpoints comprised patient satisfaction, change in competitive sports level, and time to return to sport. Complications were noted.
Results
Six patients (12 forearms) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 22.5 months (range: 3–48 months). Mean pain rating was 7.3/10 (range: 6–9) preoperatively, and 0/10 postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the procedure. Mean time to return to sports was 25.5 days (range: 21–30 days). No patients decreased their competitive sports level after the procedure. One patient presented a postoperative hematoma, not requiring surgery.
Conclusion
Ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is an innovative technique with promising preliminary results.

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, is transforming healthcare by offering novel ways to synthesize and communicate medical knowledge. This development is especially relevant in cardiology, as patient education, clinical decision-making, and administrative workflows play pivotal roles in this area. ChatGPT, originally built on GPT-3 and refined into GPT-4, can simplify complex cardiology literature, translate technical explanations into plain language, and address questions across different linguistic backgrounds. Studies show that although ChatGPT demonstrates considerable promise in performing text-based tasks—ranging from passing portions of the European Exam in Core Cardiology to creating patient-friendly educational materials—its inability to interpret images remains a major limitation. Meanwhile, concerns around false information, data bias, and ethical issues highlight the need for careful oversight. Future directions include integrating LLMs with computer-vision modules for image-based diagnostics and combining unstructured patient data to improve risk prediction and phenotyping. Social-media research suggests that chatbots sometimes provide more-empathetic responses than do physicians, underscoring both their potential advantages and complexities. LLM-based tools can also generate letters for insurance prior authorizations or appeals, helping reduce administrative burden. New multimodal approaches, such as ChatGPT Vision, have the potential to enable direct image processing, although clinical validation of this function is yet to be established. The judicious integration of ChatGPT and other LLMs into cardiology requires ongoing validation, robust regulatory frameworks, and strong ethical guidelines to ensure patient privacy, avoid misinformation, and promote equitable healthcare delivery. This review aims to provide a primer on LLMs for cardiovascular professionals, summarizing key applications, current limitations, and prospects in this rapidly evolving field of digital health.
Résumé
L'intelligence artificielle (IA) générative, en particulier les grands modèles de langage (LLM) tels que ChatGPT, transforme les soins de santé en offrant de nouveaux moyens de synthétiser et de communiquer les connaissances médicales. Ceci est particulièrement pertinent en cardiologie, où l'éducation des patients, la prise de décision clinique et les flux de travail administratifs jouent un rôle central. ChatGPT, basé à l'origine sur GPT-3 et affiné dans GPT-4, peut simplifier la littérature complexe en cardiologie, traduire des explications techniques en langage clair et répondre à des questions provenant de différents contextes linguistiques. Les études montrent que si ChatGPT démontre un potentiel très prometteur pour les tâches basées sur le texte - qui vont de la réussite de certaines parties de l'examen européen de cardiologie de base à la création de matériel éducatif accessible aux patients - son incapacité à interpréter les images reste une limitation majeure. Par ailleurs, les inquiétudes concernant les renseignements faux, les biais de données et les questions éthiques soulignent la nécessité d'une supervision attentive. Les orientations futures comprennent l'intégration des LLM avec des modules de vision par ordinateur pour les diagnostics basés sur l'image et la combinaison de données non structurées sur les patients pour améliorer la prédiction des risques et le phénotypage. Les recherches sur les médias sociaux suggèrent que les agents conversationnels peuvent parfois fournir des réponses plus empathiques que les médecins, révélant des opportunités et les complications inhérentes. Pour les tâches administratives, les outils basés sur les LLM peuvent générer des lettres pour les demandes d'autorisation préalable ou des appels, contribuant ainsi à réduire la charge administrative. De nouvelles approches multimodales, telles que « ChatGPT Vision », pourraient à l'avenir permettre un traitement direct des images, bien que la validation clinique reste à établir. En fin de compte, l'intégration judicieuse de ChatGPT et d'autres LLM en cardiologie nécessitera une validation continue, des cadres réglementaires solides et des lignes directrices éthiques strictes pour garantir la confidentialité des patients, éviter la désinformation et promouvoir une prestation de soins de santé équitable. Cette étude a pour but de fournir aux professionnels de la santé cardiovasculaire une introduction aux LLM, en résumant les applications clés, les limites actuelles et les perspectives dans ce domaine de la santé numérique qui évolue rapidement.}

The National Library of Medicine’s Integrated Academic/Advanced Information Management Systems (IAIMS) initiative played a central role in the evolution of health informatics over the project’s lifetime (1983–2009) and continues to do so.
Aim
Our objective is to demonstrate how IAIMS and two key IAIMS concepts, integration and outreach, have functioned at very different times during this evolutionary process.
Approach
Using a framework drawn from Lorenzi and Stead’s 2021 history of IAIMS, we examine the role of integration and outreach in work at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) in the early 1980s and at the University of Texas Arlington (UTA) in 2020.
Results
Guided by these concepts, UMB implemented a campus-wide information utility, while UTA established a center to accelerate research and innovation.
Conclusions
Outreach and integration have been formative in the evolution of health informatics and will continue to hold their power.}

Given the expected time until the heat death of the universe, we demonstrate that the widely-accepted conclusion from the Infinite Monkeys Theorem is, in fact, misleading in our finite universe. As such, this places the theorem in a class of probabilistic problems or paradoxes, including the St. Petersburg paradox, Zeno's dichotomy paradox and the Ross–Littlewood paradox wherein the infinite-resource conclusions directly contradict those obtained when considering limited resources, however sizeable.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Simulated paediatric surgical training is inherently advantageous and flourishing. Moreover, several working conditions resulted in reduced training hours, index and subspecialty cases encountered, and the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgery backlogs, hence training opportunities. Hypospadias repair is technically-demanding and requires a spectrum of dissective and reconstructive skills. We therefore aimed to test a 3D-printed silicon model for hypospadias repair, in the context of hands-on surgical training.
Material and methods
Twenty-Seven trainees, under the supervision of 15 instructors, completed the activity. They were given a seminar to show the relevant anatomy, and 8 key steps of the exercise: (1)-degloving; (2)-urethral plate marking; (3)-incision; (4)-tubularisation; (5)-glansplasty/glanuloplasty; (6)-dartos layer preparation; (7)-preputioplasty and (8)-skin closure. Each trainee completed a structured feedback assessment. An on-site trainer supervised and evaluated each exercise. Trainees and trainers rated the model through the above steps from unsatisfactory-(1/5) to excellent-(5/5), presented herein via cross-sectional analysis.
Results
Eleven-(40.7 %) trainees were in years:1–3 of specialist training, 10-(37 %) were in years:4–6, and 6-(22.2 %) were beyond year-6. Two-(7.4 %) trainees had nil-hypospadias experience, 16-(59.2 %) previously assisted in procedures or performed steps, 5-(18.5 %) performed whole procedures supervised and 4-(14.8 %) independently. Twenty-(74 %) trainees and 15-(100 %) instructors judged the model to resemble the anomaly. Seventeen-(63 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material needle-penetrability ≥3/5, compared to human tissue. Sixteen-(59 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material suture holding ≥3/5. Eleven-(73.3 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated sutures’ evenness and edge coaptability ≥3/5.
Discussion
Hypospadias is an index operation, which requires precision skills. Simulated training in Paediatric Surgery and Urology is gaining importance. 3D-printed models are gaining a key role in simulated training. The study presents a novel 3D-printed high-fidelity silicon-based hypospadias model designed for hands-on training. A structured pathway to divide a standard hypospadias repair into key steps is displayed to ensure skill acquisition and stabilisation.
Conclusion
This 3D-printed silicon-based hypospadias model is proven useful for hands-on training. The fidelity can still improve, especially regarding suture holding of the material.

Comparative analysis with four demographically matched traditional cohorts (n = 93) revealed that GenAI-supported instruction significantly improved assignment performance. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression confirmed that AI integration was a robust and statistically significant predictor of higher scores, even after controlling for demographic and professional background variables. Simultaneous quantile regression further showed that lower-performing students experienced the greatest gains, highlighting the intervention's equalizing potential. Beyond these quantitative results, students demonstrated more structured economic reasoning and deeper conceptual application.

Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth—namely that highly hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and cell envelope morphology (hops are not equally effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre- and post-assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.}

abstract = {Considering the influence of external time-varying disturbances on trajectory tracking control of nonlinear systems, a novel prescribed-time nonsingular sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed. Firstly, based on the definition of prescribed time stability, a lemma of practical prescribed time stability is proposed, which guarantees the system states converge to a region within the prescribed time. Secondly, a prescribed time SMC method is designed, which does not contain negative power terms in the controller and solves the singular problem. In addition, a continuous function is adopted instead of the sign function to reduce chattering, and it is also considered in the stability proof. The stability analysis shows that whatever it is in the sliding stage or the reaching stage, the tracking error is prescribed time stable. On the basis of prescribed time SMC method, the neural network (NN) is introduced to approximate the unknown model information. Finally, compared with other existing control methods, the results of simulation demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance, encompassing the achievement of prescribed time stability, the elimination of chattering, and the capability to analyze unknown model information via neural networks.}

abstract = {Introduction
The management of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) is well established in case of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears (RCTs). However, its treatment in the context of small RCTs, especially those involving the supraspinatus tendon remain controversial, with ongoing debate over whether tenotomy, tenodesis, or simple preservation is the most appropriate approach. This study hypothesized that a non-conservative treatment (either isolated tenotomy or tenodesis) would yield equivalent functional outcomes, regardless of the macroscopic intraoperative appearance of the biceps tendon.
Materials and methods
In this prospective multicenter study, 210 patients underwent rotator cuff repair for a tear primarily affecting the supraspinatus tendon. A tenotomy or a tenodesis of the LHBT was systematically performed, regardless of its intraoperative appearance (normal or pathologic). Functional outcomes at two years (VAS, Constant score, SSV, ASES score) were collected and compared according to the macroscopic aspect of the tendon. To account for potential confounding factors, a 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Outcomes were also compared between tenotomy and tenodesis groups. Cuff healing was assessed by ultrasound at the last follow-up.
Results
At the two-year follow-up, after propensity-score matching, no statistically significant differences were found between groups in any of the tested score (Constant score, p = 0.96; VAS, p = 0.33; ASES score, p = 0.50). Before matching, functional scores were significantly better in patients who underwent tenotomy or tenodesis in combination with cuff repair when the LHBT appeared macroscopically normal during surgery: Constant score (87 ± 8 vs. 83 ± 11, p = 0.003), ASES score (91 ± 19 vs. 85 ± 22, p = 0.002), and SSV (95 ± 9 vs. 79 ± 31, p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in Constant score improvement. Tenodesis was associated with better flexion strength, but no statistical differences were observed for other outcomes, including the Popeye deformity. At two years, cuff healing rates were similar between the two groups.
Conclusion
After controlling for confounding factors, the macroscopic appearance of the LHBT did not significantly influence clinical outcomes at two years after rotator cuff repair and tenotomy or tenodesis.
