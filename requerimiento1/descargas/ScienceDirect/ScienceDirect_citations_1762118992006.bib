Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.
Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.}

It is regularly transported by migratory birds and there are chances that these ticks may become sources for the emergence of resident populations in the temperate region due to recent changes in climatic conditions. In May 2023, a Hylomma sp. nymph was collected in SE Romania from a long-distance migrant host, the Pied Wheatear (Oenanthe pleschanka) with known migratory route. The tick was identified morphologically and genetically as H. rufipes and based on the timing of the migratory track it attached to its avian host in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East. This is the first ever H. rufipes recorded in Europe with known Middle Eastern/Asian origin.}

abstract = {In urban landscape design, the optimization of spatial layout is very important because it directly affects the functionality, ecological benefits and aesthetic effects of the landscape. This paper introduces a generative algorithm to optimize the layout of garden space elements. It aims to improve the rationality, aesthetics and functionality of the layout scheme through automation and intelligence, so as to better adapt to different environments and user needs. First, a geometric model of the urban landscape space is constructed, and the functional areas, green spaces, water bodies and other elements of the garden are converted into design constraints and objective functions suitable for generative algorithm processing. Then, using genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, through the iterative evolution process of the population, the position, form and combination of spatial elements are gradually adjusted to achieve the predetermined design goals. Finally, the fitness function is introduced to evaluate the pros and cons of each generation of layout schemes, including the openness of the landscape view, the coherence of the functional areas and the aesthetic evaluation. Through multiple iterations, the algorithm gradually converges to the optimal solution and provides a garden layout scheme that meets specific needs. In the layout optimization under complex terrain, the space utilization rate is between 75.0% and 77.8%. The landscape view is distributed between 66.3% and 68.0%, which is relatively evenly distributed. The urban landscape garden space element layout optimization method based on the generative algorithm introduced in this paper not only improves the design efficiency and accuracy but also provides new ideas for urban garden planning.}

This study explores how color temperature serves as a heuristic-based nudge to alter individuals' dining behaviors at restaurants. The findings of three experimental studies consistently demonstrate that color temperature affects individuals' perceptions of food healthiness, food tastiness, and their food consumption intentions. A cool-colored food image enhances perceptions of food healthiness and aligns with healthy dining information to influence individuals' consumption intentions. Conversely, a warm-colored food image is more effective at promoting taste-oriented food consumption. These results expand our understanding of how color influences consumer dining behaviors and offer valuable insights for hospitality practitioners to promote healthy dining through color adjustments.}

The earliest paradigm (craft production) and the current transformation (regionalized/personalized production) share a fundamental characteristic—high product variety and low product volume. In both cases, co-creation between the customer and the producer is essential. In the co-creation process, high-level product information (i.e., linguistic descriptions of a product) must be translated into machine-readable formats such as CAD models. However, the short design cycle and the lack of necessary tools and expertise in CAD modeling pose significant challenges. This study examines a fundamental issue: how to frame the CAD model creation problem in a way that enables novice users to obtain a desired solution efficiently. Findings indicate that empathetic adaptation provides structured guidelines for iterative prompting, helping novices navigate CAD modeling tasks more effectively. The study thus highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) in addressing highly knowledge-intensive challenges within personalized production.}

abstract = {This study develops an intelligent multimodal learning path recommendation system to address the problems of lack of personalized learning paths and insufficient attention to students’ emotional impact in traditional digital education models. By integrating learning behavior analysis and sentiment analysis, the Random Forest (RF) model is used to deeply mine students’ learning behavior data, such as analyzing learning time, resource access frequency, etc., to precisely understand students’ learning patterns. At the same time, with the help of sentiment analysis technology based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), students’ emotional states during the learning process are monitored in real-time, including positive, negative, neutral, and other emotions. The experimental results show that by dynamically adjusting the learning path and monitoring students’ emotional states, students’ average scores increase by 6.0%, and homework completion rate increases by 4.4%. This study not only improves the overall quality of education, but also provides educators with more scientific decision-making support tools.}

Key topics include the movement from form to process in contemporary design, the renewed centrality of materials, the “material turn” in the humanities and social sciences, and the return of ornament. In conclusion, architecture is described as both a medium and a regulator of the human relationship to the material world.}

abstract = {Fake reviews corrode the trust between businesses and consumers and distort the online image of a service or a product. The problem of fake review contamination is only going to worsen with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), that allow even novice users to massively produce fake reviews that can easily be mistaken for real. In this paper, we study a particular type of fake review attack, the AI-paraphrased reviews generated with ChatGPT 4.0. For this, we use an efficient pattern detection algorithm to quantify the similarity between the paraphrased and original reviews. We use a dataset that consists of 400 reviews spanning 20 hotels around the globe and 6000 fake reviews through Open AI API. Our results show that as the word length pattern increases, the mean similarity ratio between original (human) and AI paraphrased texts converge to 0 % while it stays above 20 % between AI-paraphrased texts. This pattern is consistent for reviews of hotels with diverse geographic locations. In this way, we introduce the importance of text similarity detection as a feature that could be incorporated to the design of future fake review detection algorithms. This method can be generalized to other applications where AI paraphrased text detection is necessary.}

A rapid, durable response to bradykinin-targeted medication is considered supportive, and this study aimed to evaluate the use of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH) in this regard. A retrospective medical records review was conducted for angioedema/HAE codes. Thirty-one patients with HAE-nl-C1INH were identified (female, 87.1%; mean age, 46.2 years; range, 16–74 years). All patients had experienced recurrent angioedema, with documentation of antihistamine and/or mast cell–targeted therapy ineffectiveness and normal/near-normal laboratory data. Genetic testing (n = 9) found no known pathogenic variants of HAE. Diagnosis of HAE-nl-C1INH was confirmed in the 31 patients via a favorable response after intravenous rhC1-INH (weight-based; maximum, 4200 U) during an angioedema attack. Only 30.0% (9/30) of patients with documented information had been aware of a family history of recurrent angioedema/HAE. In conclusion, reliance on a family history of recurrent angioedema as a diagnostic criterion may delay accurate diagnosis and access to effective treatment. These results support that responsiveness to C1–INH replacement therapy may also be a useful supportive diagnostic criterion for HAE-nl-C1INH.}

abstract = {Background
MET gene exon 14 skipping was identified as a potential driver mutation that occurs in approximately 3%-4% of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), typically in the absence of other driver mutations. Capmatinib and tepotinib were the first MET- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs) approved by the FDA and PMDA, specifically for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Several studies have reported acquired resistance after MET-TKI treatment for MET mutation-positive NSCLC. Sequencing of the MET kinase region of resistant cell lines revealed secondary mutations at residues D1228 and Y1230 that were sensitive to type II MET-TKIs, such as cabozantinib. This suggested that sequential administration of other MET-TKIs may overcome the development of secondary mutations after acquired resistance in MET exon 14 mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We designed the single arm phase II study CAPTURE Trial to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with activating MET exon 14 alterations who developed acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib, as well as after 2 prior chemotherapy regimens that included platinum and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committees. The sample size (n = 30) is calculated by assuming a threshold response rate of 5% and an expected response rate of 25%. Recruitment began in August 2024.
Results
This ongoing study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib after acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib.}

We performed a set of experiments with various iodides and boric acid concentrations, with two different ion exchange resin loads, and at two different temperatures. Sorption isotherm experiments were used to evaluate the removal efficiency of the ion exchanger for iodides and for boric acid, as well as to fit the Langmuir isotherm. Kinetic experiments were used to study the kinetics of the adsorption on the ion exchanger, as well as to investigate the mechanism of iodides adsorption on the ion exchange resin - pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intra-particle diffusion models were applied to the experimental data.}

An ideal decolorization algorithm should be both efficient and robust while preserving color consistency and detail contrast. In this study, we revisit the RTCP (Real-time Contrast-Preserving Decolorization) algorithm and propose three key optimizations: a clustering-guided decolorization approach, a locally adaptive decolorization strategy, and a weight-optimized decolorization method. To enhance solution quality, we implement a constrained particle swarm optimization framework to systematically explore the parameter space. Experimental validation on two standard datasets (Ĉadík and CSDD) demonstrates that our optimized methods handle diverse decolorization scenarios more effectively while maintaining competitive performance against existing approaches. Recognizing the limitations of current evaluation metrics in assessing detail contrast preservation, we introduce the D-C2G-SSIM metric for more accurate quantitative assessment. Comparative results show consistent improvements over the original RTCP algorithm, with the average D-C2G-SSIM score increasing from 0.8331 to 0.8442 on Ĉadík dataset and from 0.8696 to 0.8847 on the CSDD dataset, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.}

The literature is scarce on how to perform general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery in women with class 3 obesity.
Methods
In this retrospective study, we evaluated characteristics related to the conduct of general anaesthesia for elective and non-elective caesarean delivery in 56 pregnant women with class 3 obesity in nine maternity units across the north-west of England, between 2022–2023. We analysed the pre-oxygenation technique, anaesthetic agents utilised, documented hypoxia (SpO2 ≤ 94 %) occurrence, and the frequency of difficult intubation.
Results
A de novo facemask technique was used for preoxygenation in 82% of cases, whilst high-flow nasal oxygen was utilised in 13.2%. Propofol was utilised in 78% whilst an opioid predelivery was administered to 55% of women. Rocuronium was the preferred neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation in 68% of cases. Video laryngoscopy was employed in 68% whilst hypoxia was documented in 25% of women. Difficult intubation occurred in one woman (1.8%, 95% CI 0.0–9.6), and no failed intubations were recorded.
Conclusion
Our study highlights variability in the administration of general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery in women with class 3 obesity, and frequent occurrence of hypoxia. Further research is needed to determine optimal preoxygenation strategy and general anaesthesia technique to minimise hypoxia and difficult intubation risk in this cohort. A general anaesthetic (GA) is uncommonly used for women with class 3 obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m2) during caesarean delivery (CD) because of associated airway risks.1 Recent studies report GA rates varying from 2-8 % in this population, but details of the GA were not elaborated upon.2, 3 In our previous analysis across nine hospitals in north-west England (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023), 7.4 % (56/760) women with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 had a GA for CD.4 Primary and secondary general anaesthetics each accounted for 50 % of the total GA cases (28 out of 56). We retrospectively reviewed the records of these 56 women as part of a secondary analysis to shed light on the conduct of GA.}

Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) requires long-term adherence to oral anticoagulation and self-care.
Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based relational agent and heart rhythm monitor with the primary outcome of anticoagulation adherence and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QOL) and health care utilization. The trial enrolled individuals with Atrial fibrillation (AF) taking anticoagulation. Intervention participants received a smartphone-based relational agent for disease education, adherence monitoring, and self-care, and a heart rate and rhythm monitor. Attention control participants received a smartphone health education application and the same heart monitor. Participants had baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits. The primary outcome was 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC) ascertained with pharmacy claims.
Results
From January, 2020 to April, 2022, the trial enrolled 243 participants (age 70.8 ± 9.8 years; 64.2% female; 30.5% Black race). The adjusted mean PDC at 12 months in the intervention arm was 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.84-0.93) and in the attention control 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90) with no difference in odds of PDC ≥ 0.80 in intervention compared to the control (Odds Ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.66-2.38]). Self-reported nonadherence and QOL did not differ by study arm. The event rates for health care utilization were significantly less for intervention than attention control participants as measured by emergency room visits and hospitalizations (P < .001) and number of days hospitalized (P = .004).
Conclusion
The smartphone-based relational agent intervention did not achieve its primary endpoint of increased anticoagulation adherence but did yield decreased health care utilization.

The patient, a 33-year-old healthy woman, presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath, fatigue and chest discomfort five days after an uncomplicated full-term vaginal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy. Diagnostic workup confirmed a PPCM. Following a multidisciplinary approach, the patient underwent a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program which included 24 supervised biweekly exercise training sessions, a home-exercise program and a once-weekly group psycho-behavioral intervention. After 12 weeks, the patient showed substantial improvements in functional capacity, cardiac function, and quality of life. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and the central role of cardiac rehabilitation in the management of PPCM.
Resumen
La miocardiopatía periparto (MCPP) es una condición rara, pero grave, derivada del deterioro estructural y funcional en las últimas etapas del embarazo, o poco después del parto. La paciente, una mujer sana de 33 años, acudió con aparición súbita de dificultad respiratoria, fatiga y malestar torácico transcurridos cinco días de un parto vaginal a término sin complicaciones, tras un embarazo sin incidentes. Las pruebas diagnósticas confirmaron MCPP. Tras un enfoque multidisciplinar, la paciente fue sometida a un programa amplio de rehabilitación cardiaca que incluyó 24 sesiones de ejercicios de entrenamiento semanales supervisadas, un programa de ejercicios domiciliario y una intervención de grupo psico-conductual una vez por semana. Transcurridas doce semanas, la paciente mostró mejoras sustanciales en cuanto a capacidad funcional, función cardiaca y calidad de vida. Este caso destaca la importancia del diagnóstico temprano, la intervención oportuna y el papel central de la rehabilitación cardiaca en el manejo de la MCPP.}

abstract = {Background
Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are common complications after surgery and anaesthesia, particularly in older adults, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Therefore, major medical societies have developed recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PNDs. Our study evaluated the reliability of large language models, specifically ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, in generating recommendations for PND management and comparing them with published guidelines.
Methods
We conducted an online cross-sectional web-based analysis over 48 h in June 2024. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated recommendations were produced in six different locations across five countries (Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Canada, and the East and West Coasts of the USA). The English prompt ‘a table of a bundle of care for perioperative neurocognitive disorders’ was entered into ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, generating tables evaluated by independent reviewers. The primary outcomes were the Total Disagreement Score (TDS) and Quality Assessment of Medical Artificial Intelligence (QAMAI), which compared AI-generated recommendations with published guidelines.
Results
The study generated 14 tables, with TDS and QAMAI scores showing similar results for ChatGPT-4 and Gemini (2 [1–3] vs 2 [2–3], P=0.636 and 4 [4–4] vs 4 [3–4], P=0.424, respectively). AI-generated recommendations aligned well with published guidelines, with the highest alignment observed in ChatGPT-4-generated recommendations. No complete agreement with guidelines was achieved, and lack of cited sources was a noted limitation.
Conclusions
Large language models can generate perioperative neurocognitive disorder recommendations that align closely with published guidelines. However, further validation and integration of clinician feedback are required before clinical application.}

This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible.}

A comparative life cycle assessment is conducted to analyze the environmental impacts of two scenarios: recycling all bolts at the end of the wind turbine’s life cycle, and reusing some bolts after inspection. The product system is modeled in openLCA, where the processes of the foreground system are linked to the Ecoinvent database in the background system. For life cycle impact assessment, the ReCiPe 2016 method is applied, focusing on climate impact. Results show that after five life cycles, reusing bolts reduces the climate impact by 48%, compared to a 42% reduction through recycling alone. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the potential for impact reduction through reuse is primarily driven by the achievable reuse rate, while factors such as production technology, electricity mix, and transportation distances play a smaller role.}

abstract = {Background
Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) devices, such as the Lund University Cardiac Assist System (LUCAS), were developed to reduce variability in the quality of chest compressions and improve outcomes of cardiac arrest. With increasing adoption of mechanical CPR devices, understanding the nature and frequency of device-related complications is critical to ensuring patient safety.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of all adverse events involving the LUCAS 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1 devices from 2015-2024 Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) maintained by the US Food and Drug -Administration. Reports were manually reviewed, categorized by device subtype, and further stratified by type of complication. Events were grouped into device- or patient-related categories to identify trends and potential causes.
Results
A total of 255 adverse events were reported, with an increase from 12 events in 2015 to 33 in 2024. Most events were associated with LUCAS 1.0 (50.2%) and LUCAS 2.0 (27.1%). The most frequent device-related issues involved device defect (53.7%) and power failure (26.7%). Patient-related complications included soft tissue injury (22.0%), internal organ injury (20.4%), and chest compression interruption (13.7%). Malfunctions such as abrupt stoppage, loss of suction, or misalignment were frequently noted as contributing factors.
Conclusion
Reported adverse events associated with LUCAS use include device malfunction and deployment issues, with serious patient harm including death or organ injury, in some cases. As mechanical CPR becomes more widely adopted, knowledge of the most common complications can inform operator training and potential mitigating strategies to minimize adverse outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Recent lay and medical headlines reported that fish oil supplement (FOS) use in the UK Biobank (UKBB) increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) in the general population. The publicity generated by this report (the conclusions of which have since been questioned) led us to consider what other FOS-disease outcome relationships have been examined in this very large population study.
Methods
We surveyed the medical literature for papers reporting on the associations between reported FOS use in the UKBB and risk for a wide variety of diseases.
Results
In addition to two similar reports on FOS use and AF, we reviewed 32 other UKBB studies examining the associations between FOS use and disease/condition. Collectively, these studies reported 60 FOS vs disease/condition associations of which 44 were significant and favorable for FOS use, and one was significant and unfavorable for FOS use (osteoarthritis). Studies linking circulating blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids provide a more objective measure of exposure than a yes-no answer to a FOS use questionnaire. Thus, we highlight the results of six published meta-analyses using blood biomarkers that have reported 11 statistically significant, favorable relationships with major disease outcomes, and one neutral association (hemorrhagic stroke) and no unfavorable associations.
Conclusions
Together, these consistent findings across UKBB FOS and biomarker-based meta-analyses support the hypothesis that higher omega-3 status (however achieved) is generally beneficial for health. Because of the wide variety of outcomes favorably linked with FOS use (and elevated omega-3 blood levels) it seems unlikely that a “healthy user bias” and not the bioactivity of omega-3 fatty acids themselves; can explain all these relationships.}

However, research has shown that overprescription and improper handling of these medications contribute to problematic substance use, dependency, and overdose among the pediatric population. Despite increased awareness and efforts to mitigate the opioid epidemic, challenges persist, including inconsistent prescribing practices, inadequate education on safe disposal practices, gaps in prescription monitoring systems, and barriers to naloxone availability. In this review, we will highlight actionable steps and strategies for advocacy and intervention to reduce the burden of the opioid crisis in children and adolescents. Key topics include the critical role of opioid stewardship when managing postoperative pain, the importance of family engagement and education on safe disposal methods, the ongoing challenges of safe prescribing and monitoring, and opportunities to extend substance use screening and treatment referral for injured adolescents. Additionally, we will highlight policy recommendations to promote equitable access and availability of harm reduction tools such as naloxone. These strategies, if implemented together, can significantly reduce the risks associated with pediatric opioid use and mitigate the impact of the opioid epidemic on children and adolescents.}

In education and other disciplines interested in disrupting White supremacy embodied across much of today’s policy and procedures, there is an increasing call to incorporate a diverse range of critical approaches to research methods. This pivoting aims to challenge the marginalization of subaltern ways of knowing, which has resulted in a tradition of reliance on (post-)positivist frameworks that limit the scope of research inference and validity. Critical psychometrics has become central in shaping our understanding of measurement, its accuracy, and the rationale behind approaches to code self-reported demographic categories as stable, fixed, and accurate estimates of oppression. This paper provides two mixed-methods survey study examples where these assumptions unsettle the notion that self-report demographics measure comparative indices of identity. Implications of this critical quantitative psychometric appraisal challenges the taken-for-granted nature of self-reported demographics; that is, these essentialized identity categories should be used to accurately and precisely compare differences between disability, race, class, gender, socioeconomic status, and educational background. With the validity theory behind this assumption challenged, this work provides a starting point, a stake in the ground, to pursue diverse methods to validate self-reports.}

abstract = {Introduction
Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a hereditary condition that affects millions worldwide, predominantly in individuals of African, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern descent. While traditionally considered a benign carrier state, emerging evidence suggests a potential association between SCT and malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between SCT and the risk of multiple myeloma, renal cancer, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal cancer.
Methods
This study utilized de-identified electronic health records from the TriNetX database, covering a 20-year period. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to assess cancer incidence and survival outcomes among SCT and sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Statistical analyses included risk difference (RD), risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard ratios (HR) to determine associations between SCT and cancer risk.
Results
SCT was not associated with an increased risk for most cancers. However, individuals with SCT had a significantly lower risk of leukemia compared to those with SCD (RR =0.464, OR = 0.463, p < 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect. Conversely, a modest but statistically insignificant increase in renal cancer risk was observed in SCT individuals (RR = 1.201, OR = 1.202, p = 0.059). No significant associations were found between SCT and multiple myeloma, HCC, or colorectal cancer.
Discussion
These findings highlight a complex relationship between SCT and malignancy risk. The observed protective effect against leukemia suggests a potential hematopoietic or immune-mediated mechanism. Meanwhile, the slight increase in renal cancer risk may be linked to chronic kidney stress and hematuria. Further studies are needed to validate these associations and investigate underlying biological mechanisms.
Conclusion
SCT does not significantly increase cancer risk overall but may confer protection against leukemia while showing a potential, though inconclusive, link to renal cancer. These findings emphasize the need for continued surveillance and further epidemiological studies to refine cancer risk assessment in SCT populations.}

Only a few studies have explored how compassion is taught to nursing students. This study aimed to investigate the differences in compassionate flow among nursing students both before and after an educational intervention.
Materials and methods
This study employed a cluster randomised controlled trial design in medical schools in Taiwan. We enrolled first- and second-year nursing students. The intervention group underwent dance movement therapy, while the control group received yoga training. Compassionate flow was assessed using the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scale and the Fears of Compassion Scale.
Results
A total of 59 participants (31 in the experimental group and 28 in the control group) were included in the final statistical analysis, and an 82 % response rate was recorded. Statistically significant differences were observed in total scores on the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scales, along with compassion for self and compassion from other subscales between the experimental and control groups (p < .05). The η2 effect levels were 0.12, 0.12, and 0.09.
Conclusions
Educational training employing dance movement therapy demonstrated enhancements in self-compassion and compassion for others among first- and second-year nursing students.}
