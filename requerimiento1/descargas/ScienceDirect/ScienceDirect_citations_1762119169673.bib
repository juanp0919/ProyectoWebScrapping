abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Both abdominal obesity (AO) and insulin resistance (IR) are predictors of cardiometabolic disease (CMD). We aimed to evaluate the temporal relationship between AO and IR and their combined effect on CMD risk.
Methods
A nationally representative cohort of 9234 participants was included, with a maximum follow-up of 9 years. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was calculated as an indicator of IR, and AO was measured by waist circumference (WC). Cox regression was applied to evaluate the combined effect of AO and TyG on CMD risk, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine the temporal relationship. Multiplicative and additive interactions between AO and insulin resistance, as well as the mediating effect of TyG, were assessed.
Results
Individuals concurrently with AO and higher TyG (≥8.6 [median]) had the highest risk of hypertension (HR,1.46; 95%CI, 1.25-1.69), diabetes (HR, 1.99; 95%CI, 1.65-2.41), and stroke (HR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.22-1.94). A biological interaction between AO and IR on diabetes was observed, with the attributable proportion due to interaction being 29%. There was a bidirectional temporal relationship between WC and TyG, and the effect of WC on TyG was more prominent than vice versa. High TyG had a mediating effect on the association of AO with hypertension (19%), diabetes (25%), and stroke (24%).
Conclusions
The findings reveal a temporal relationship between AO and IR, their combined effect on hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, and the mediating role of IR. Strategies simultaneously targeting both factors should be emphasized for the primary prevention of CMD.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Tanto la obesidad abdominal (OA) como la resistencia a la insulina (RI) son predictores de enfermedades cardiometabólicas (ECM). Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar la relación temporal entre la OA y la RI, y su efecto combinado en el riesgo de ECM.
Métodos
Se incluyó una cohorte representativa a nivel nacional de 9.234 participantes, con un seguimiento máximo de 9 años. El índice triglicéridos-glucosa (TyG) se calculó como un indicador de RI, y la OA se midió mediante la circunferencia de la cintura (CC). Se aplicó la regresión de Cox para evaluar el efecto combinado de la OA y el TyG en el riesgo de ECM, incluyendo hipertensión, diabetes, enfermedades cardiacas y accidente cerebrovascular. Se utilizó un modelo de correlaciones cruzadas para examinar la relación temporal. Se evaluó la interacción multiplicativa y aditiva entre la OA y la RI, y el efecto mediador del TyG.
Resultados
Los individuos con OA y un TyG elevado (≥8,6 [mediana]) presentaron el mayor riesgo de hipertensión (HR=1,46; IC95%, 1,25-1,69), diabetes (HR=1,99; IC95%, 1,65-2,41) y accidente cerebrovascular (HR=1,76; IC95%, 1,22-1,94). Se observó una interacción biológica entre la OA y la RI en la diabetes, con una proporción atribuible a la interacción del 29%. Hubo una relación temporal bidireccional entre la CC y el TyG, y el efecto de la CC sobre el TyG fue más prominente que al contrario. Un TyG elevado tuvo un efecto mediador en la asociación de la OA con la hipertensión (19%), la diabetes (25%) y los accidentes cerebrovasculares (24%).
Conclusiones
Los hallazgos revelan una relación temporal entre la OA y la RI, su efecto combinado en la hipertensión, la diabetes y el accidente cerebrovascular, y el papel mediador de la RI. Deberían promoverse estrategias que aborden simultáneamente ambos factores para la prevención primaria de las ECM.}

abstract = {Background:
Modeling heterogeneous disease states by data-driven methods has great potential to advance biomedical research. However, a comprehensive analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity is often challenged by the complex nature of biomedical datasets and emerging imaging methodologies.
Methods:
Here, we propose a novel GAN Inversion-enabled Latent Eigenvalue Analysis (GILEA) framework and apply it to in silico phenome profiling and editing.
Results:
We show the performance of GILEA using cellular imaging datasets stained with the multiplexed fluorescence Cell Painting protocol. The quantitative results of GILEA can be biologically supported by editing of the latent representations and simulation of dynamic phenotype transitions between physiological and pathological states.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, GILEA represents a new and broadly applicable approach to the quantitative and interpretable analysis of biomedical image data. The GILEA code and video demos are available at https://github.com/CTPLab/GILEA.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand of tighter tolerance components requires more accurate machine tools with volumetric compensation. In mass production, post-machining inspection of the workpiece on a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) provides statistical quality control information on the variability of the manufacturing process. The dynamic face offset (DFO) is proposed to compensate the machine tool errors. The method is utilizing the part quality CMM data to determine the specific compensation parameters that are used in the machine tool controller to minimize the machine tool errors for specific part faces. The DFO does not considers the table offset parameters as when using the global offset compensation method. The table errors are incorporated within the local offsets. This paper presents the development of a DFO compensation method utilizing the measurements of the machined part(s). The DFO for 4-axis and 5-axis machine tools is estimated through a model while utilizing the computed deviations between the measured and nominal dimensions of the part. The measuring results before and after compensation are compared and demonstrate that the errors are reduced and compensated successfully.}

This paper introduces a novel framework for the inverse generative design of composite structures, leveraging a classifier-free diffusion model conditioned on prescribed nonlinear mechanical behaviors under large equibiaxial extension deformation. The proposed model is trained using the Mechanical MNIST Cahn-Hilliard dataset, enabling it to generate high-fidelity structures that closely align with prescribed input conditions. The generated structures exhibit mechanical behaviors that strongly align with ground truth data, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in achieving targeted mechanical behaviors. A comprehensive evaluation of the framework under varying conditions highlights its adaptability and precision, further supported by an analysis of the model's overall accuracy. This work presents a robust pipeline for conditional generative design, offering a significant step forward in tailoring composite structures to meet specific nonlinear mechanical requirements. The proposed approach underscores the potential of diffusion-based methods in advancing the design of materials with complex mechanical behaviors.}

Desirable traits often arise from complex gene networks acting across diverse conditions, making them difficult to predict and optimize manually. In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has supported this process, but its large data needs and poor integration limit its role to pattern recognition rather than explanatory trait design. We argue that hybrid AI can more effectively navigate multiomics complexity to engineer climate-smart, high-yield crops. Already reducing trial and error in crop engineering, guiding gRNA design, and identifying key regulators, hybrid AI has outperformed traditional data-driven approaches, but its full potential requires clear pipelines, curated datasets, and automation platforms.}

abstract = {Background
Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication in older critically ill patients that has a significant impact. The Family Confusion Assessment Method (FAM-CAM) is a vital tool for assisting family members in identifying delirium; however, no study has yet been reported on the Chinese version of the scale.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to translate the FAM-CAM into a Chinese version and to verify its effectiveness for delirium detection in an online patient visit setting.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study. The FAM-CAM was translated to Chinese according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Patients and family members were recruited to participate in delirium assessments in three ICUs of one hospital. Family members then used the Chinese version of the FAM-CAM to assess for delirium via online visitation, and ICU nurses assessed patients for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Results were then compared between family members' and nurses' assessments.
Results
Overall, 190 critically ill patients and 190 family members were included, of whom 117 (61.6%) were assessed for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The Cohen's kappa coefficient between the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist and FAM-CAM was 0.759 (P < 0.01). The sensitivity of the Chinese version of the FAM-CAM was 0.880, specificity was 0.890, positive predictive value was 0.928, negative predictive value was 0.823, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.881 (95% confidence interval: 0.872–0.935, P < 0.01).
Conclusion
The Chinese version of the FAM-CAM was shown to effectively help families detect delirium and was suggested as a crucial tool for assisting ICU nurses in the early identification of delirium. This tool may effectively be used to assess delirium during online visits.}

abstract = {Introduction
Clinical practice guidelines suggest maintaining adequate hydration in people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the long-term perceptions of increasing water intake and the role of self-efficacy tools are unknown.
Methods
Participants randomized to the increased water intake arm in a 3-year trial were purposively sampled and invited to semistructured interviews at the end of the study. In addition, all participants (n = 78) in the increased water intake arm were invited to complete a posttrial questionnaire.
Results
Fifteen participants completed the interview and 48 (61.5%) completed the questionnaire. Participants were motivated to adhere to the increased water intake at the start of the trial, but it became more difficult over time. Approximately half of the participants found that it was “easy” to meet fluid intake goals without interfering with their lifestyle. The main barrier was “loss of control” particularly when implementing increased water intake at social events. Furthermore, participants’ somatic and emotional state undermined motivation. Regarding self-efficacy tools, the act of carrying water bottles was considered most useful for monitoring intake; self-monitoring urine specific gravity provided positive reinforcement, and mobile phone text message reminders maintained engagement. At the end of the trial, most participants had established knowledge and habits required to increase water intake but the motivation to continue long-term was contingent on a medical benefit.
Conclusion
Habit formation to increase water intake was perceived as relatively uncomplicated by most participants. However, the gap between intention and behavior fluctuated because of intermittent social barriers and widened over time.}

abstract = {Background
The Seegene Allplex™ RV Master (RVM) assay is a one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system for detecting eight viral respiratory pathogens from nasopharyngeal swab, aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. The eight RVM targets are: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and metapneumovirus (MPV). The assay is based on Seegene’s multiple detection temperature (MuDT) technology and provides cycle threshold (Ct) values for each of its viral targets upon PCR completion.
Objective
We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the RVM assay by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent Agreement (NPA), and Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) compared to definite diagnosis and analogous reference assays.
Study design
Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were calculated by comparing the results of the RVM assay to that of definite diagnosis assays; while PPA, NPA, and OPA were calculated by comparing results of the RVM assay to that of analogous reference products. Definite diagnosis and reference methods comprised whole genome sequencing and PCR genotyping, the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV and Respiratory Panels 1, 2, and 3 assays (Seegene), and the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Plus assay (Cepheid). Reproducibility of the RVM assay using fully-automated and semi-automated nucleic acid (NA) extraction workflows and as performed by independent operators was also assessed. In total, 249 positive respiratory specimens and at least 50 negative specimens for each target tested were used for this evaluation study.
Results
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, PPA, NPA, and OPA ranged from 95.7 % to 100 % for detecting all eight targets tested on the RVM assay. Reproducibility PPA, NPA, and OPA between automated and semi-automated NA extraction workflows were all >97.9 %, while the reproducibility PPA, NPA and OPA between independent operators were all 100 %.
Conclusion
These results demonstrate a high level of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and diagnostic predictive value of the RVM assay and high agreement with comparable reference assays in identifying all eight of its targets. Taken together, our study underscores the diagnostic utility of the RVM assay in detecting eight viral respiratory pathogens.}

China is confronted with the challenge of increasing childhood obesity. Although interventions for childhood obesity have been developed, their effectiveness and implementation can vary considerably across nations. In this paper, we review and consolidate the evidence on childhood obesity intervention strategies aimed at multiple levels and components across life, in China. School-based interventions, primarily delivered with group-based dietary and physical education, have shown potential efficacy and can be enhanced by integrating food environment reform and family support. However, most interventional studies were done in eastern and urban areas of China, which highlights the need for attention in regions with insufficient health resources where policies and initiatives are less accessible. In addition, the sparse reporting on implementation design and delivery might hinder the scalability of potentially effective strategies. Amid rapid social and economic development over the past few decades, China faces unique challenges on urbanisation, physical inactivity, and nutritional transitions, necessitating an updated policy agenda for primary prevention of childhood obesity. Structural longitudinal evaluations of public initiatives led by the government and organisations along with inclusive and equitable interventions targeting children of different ages, urban–rural regions, and different ethnic and socioeconomic groups are warranted. Tackling childhood obesity in China needs a cohesive approach that integrates social, economic, cultural, and environmental strategies, combining school-based, family-based, and individual-based approaches, and concerted efforts from multiple sectors and entities within China.}

abstract = {Background
In health professions education (HPE), the concept of precision education is being explored, with the intention of tailoring learning experiences to the unique needs of learners. Recommender systems can assist academic decision-making. They can be used to personalize content delivery, suggest appropriate learning pathways, propose schedules, recommend suitable institutes, supervisors, and courses, and provide learner feedback. Given abundant learning resources, selecting the right one can be daunting. Recommender systems may address this challenge by offering tailored suggestions that align with learners’ requirements and abilities.
Objective
This study aims to examine the literature related to the use of recommender systems in HPE.
Methods
This review will be conducted following the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley. A comprehensive search will be conducted across the MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ERIC, Academic Search Premier, and Web of Science databases, as well as gray literature sources including arXiv and Google Scholar. These searches will focus on the period from January 2000 to February 2025. In addition, backward and forward citation searching will be carried out. Articles will be screened independently by 2 reviewers; discrepancies resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. The selection process will involve an initial screening of titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant articles. If initial screening is inconclusive, full-text review will ensure articles meet inclusion criteria. The main eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review are studies involving health professions students or educators, focusing on the concept, development, or application of recommender systems. Data extraction will be performed using a customized data charting template covering article, study, and recommender system details. The extracted data will be analyzed and displayed in both tabular and graphical formats, supplemented by a narrative interpretation. The findings will be synthesized by mapping the existing literature to identify key concepts, research gaps, and types of evidence, highlighting similarities and differences in how recommender systems are applied in HPE. This reporting will be in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Data extraction and analysis will be conducted using Covidence.
Results
The current phase of the study involves selecting studies for the scoping review as specified in this protocol. The search, screening, and data extraction will begin in February 2025. The results of the study and the submission of a manuscript for peer review are expected in the winter of 2025.
Conclusions
This study aims to comprehensively map the extent of recommender systems in HPE. By identifying effective practices and existing gaps, it will serve as a valuable resource for health professions educators, enabling them to make informed decisions about integrating these systems into educational applications.

In this study, we introduce an innovative systematic comparative analysis of secretomes from 18 different Xanthomonas species, integrating data from multiple proteomic studies to identify potential multitasking proteins. This approach led to the identification of 93 proteins primarily involved in central metabolism that are secreted under various physiological conditions, including 16 previously characterized moonlighting proteins. Promiscuity analysis of five selected enzymes revealed that three (asparaginase, chorismate mutase, and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase) exhibit high potential for catalyzing reactions with non-canonical substrates, suggesting additional functional roles beyond their primary enzymatic activities. Additionally, we re-annotated previously hypothetical secreted proteins, assigning functions related to central metabolism and indicating a high potential for promiscuous activity. This comprehensive compilation of potential moonlighting and promiscuous proteins in Xanthomonas provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving plant-pathogen interactions and establishes a foundation for future experimental validations of these multifunctional proteins.}

abstract = {Objectives
Chronic pain is a common healthcare issue among adults. It is not only correlated with structural impairments; it is also strongly influenced by psychological and social factors. This study aimed to identify risk factors for the onset of musculoskeletal chronic pain in adulthood during the periods of birth, childhood and adolescence.
Methods
In order to investigate the literature on our topic of interest in detail, we decided to undertake a scoping review. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro. We also searched the bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, as well as Google Scholar.
Results
A total of 169 studies were included in the analysis. Of these, 139 were conducted in Europe and the USA between January 2016 and June 2023. The female sample was larger, with 49265 patients. A total of 171 different risk factors and their definitions were identified. The most frequently reported risk factors were sexual abuse (104 cases), physical abuse (91 cases) and childhood trauma (59 cases). Other cited risk factors included family factors, psychological abuse, morbidity during childhood and socio-economic background.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors present in early life that contribute to the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adulthood. Despite the various factors described, many studies agree that exposure to multiple risk factors, particularly adverse childhood experiences, increases the likelihood of developing chronic pain in adulthood more than exposure to a single factor.}

Reassesses the challenges and opportunities confronting business schools today in light of recent developments in their socio-economic and technological environment.
Design/methodology/approach
Reviews the current situation for business schools and draws inferences for the future.
Findings
Business schools should remain the leading providers of business education in the foreseeable future. However, to sustain their dominance, they must accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are revolutionizing learning, teaching, and research. They must also bolster their external fundraising effort and address the ongoing shortage of faculty, while continuing to offer innovative curricula and programs that respond to the demands of students and employers.
Originality/value
The traditional model of business schools – where students gather in a physical location to attend standardized programs – has persisted since the inception of business schools because it is inherently robust. Its resilience stems from its adaptability and flexibility, as illustrated in this article. While the rapid advancement of AI presents significant implications for higher education, it is unlikely to fundamentally disrupt the prevailing business school model in the near term.}

However, accessing defective MOFs with exchanged metal nodes via this approach remains challenging. Herein, we report a transmetalation strategy to induce desired metal exchange frustrated flexibility defects in a prototypical MOF platform. Specifically, the pristine Zn-based MOF undergoes selective Zn-to-Mn exchange through a carefully controlled solvothermal transmetalation process. This protocol generates a series of Mn-doped MOFs with increasing Mn integration and the concomitant formation of defect sites within the framework. Detailed structural characterization confirms the successful Mn doping and illuminates the generation of vacancies and distortions around the exchanged Mn nodes. The transmetallated Mn-doped MOF materials exhibit altered chemical environments, as probed by spectroscopic techniques, and display promising sensing activity for NOx through the MOF matrix membrane. The proposed application of the MOF samples as an adsorbent-based chemical sensor includes sensing mechanisms for NO2 gas.}

abstract = {Peptide libraries are often used in drug discovery to shorten the otherwise extensive process of identifying novel binders, facilitating studies on protein-peptide interactions and epitope mapping. Despite their utility, library deconvolution, that inevitably follows hit identification, poses significant challenges because library constituents share many similar traits. While the previous computational approaches primarily focused on optimising a single library, here we propose a means of simultaneously evolving multiple peptide libraries. Our NSGA-II-based method partitions the initial, user-defined library of interest into subsets, striving to maximise both library coverage, and intra- and cross-library diversity. Moreover, to alleviate the exponential complexity of the exhaustive search algorithm used for intra-library diversity assessment and mitigate the constraint it imposed on library size, we propose a simulated annealing-supported hybrid assessment, which enabled the optimisation of libraries containing over 9.8×106 sequences. Because the complexity of the problem under consideration can substantially vary with respect to the characteristics of the user-defined library, the algorithm utilises adaptive parameter inference and an early stopping mechanism based on hyperarea oscillation monitoring to adapt carefully to each optimisation case and balance computational cost. Thorough testing of the algorithm using libraries of varying composition and size revealed that the approach successfully handles various problem complexities and creates libraries suitable for undemanding post-hit library deconvolution, while the early stopping mechanism reduced the execution time by 22%. We believe that this represents a major step forward in our efforts to create computational tools that support researchers in uncovering novel therapeutic peptides.}

However, since the discovery of the colitis-promoting effects of degraded CGN (d-CGN), its safety has been called into question. Although CGN is generally resistant to enzymatic digestion in mammalian gut, it can be degraded by the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the specific bacteria capable of degrading CGN—particularly the most commonly used form, kappa-CGN—remain uncharacterized. In this study, by using advanced culturomics approaches with chemically-defined CGN as growth substrate, we identified for the first time that Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides zhangwenhongii, and Bacteroides difficilis were functional species capable of actively degrading kappa-CGN in the mammalian gut. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the degradation products were composed mainly of disaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and hexasaccharides. Genomic analysis indicated that all three species harbored a plethora of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Among these, kappa-carrageenase and lambda-carrageenase were present in all three bacteria, while iota-carrageenase was detected only in B. xylanisolvens and B. zhangwenhongii. Our findings provide novel insights into microbial metabolism of CGN in the mammalian gut, thereby advancing the mechanistic understanding of its potential toxicological effects and informing the ongoing debate surrounding this ubiquitous food additive.}

Traditional methods such as experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often limited by environmental constraints and high computational costs. In this study, a data-driven approach leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) is developed to explore boron-doped graphene structures for enhanced work function and anode material performance. Initially, 730 DFT-calculated work function data points were expanded to 32,000 structures via symmetry-based augmentation. Molecular features including structural fingerprints and SMILES strings were integrated with atomic coordinates to represent doped configurations. The proposed Median-enhanced Attention-integrated GAN (MASGAN) model incorporated spatial and channel attention mechanisms to improve feature extraction and robustness. The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.08 eV in work function prediction compared to DFT results, with a relative deviation of less than 1.5 %. Among 32 generated candidates, B5C27 demonstrated the highest work function (5.478 eV) and dynamical stability, confirming its promise as an anode material for metal-ion batteries.This work also paves the way for rapid exploration of structures in heteroatom-doped materials.}

In the present study, we addressed this research gap by investigating social and computer science students' perceptions of the integration and use of AI-based technologies in education, focusing specifically on foreign language teaching. Using an online questionnaire, we analysed factors such as students' field of study, gender differences, and the type of AI used. The questionnaire included statements categorised into thematic clusters, with responses measured on a five-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis, including chi-square tests and Cohen's d, revealed that individuals studying computer science, males, and supporters of generative AI are more likely to use AI tools for educational purposes. They perceive fewer barriers to the integration of AI into FL education. Social science students and women are less likely to use AI tools in FL education and express scepticism about their potential to improve academic outcomes. They tend to be more critical or cautious regarding the role of AI in FL education. They view AI as a valuable tool that enhances the learning experience but, at the same time, recognise the irreplaceable role of human teachers. The study highlights the need for targeted educational initiatives to address gender and disciplinary gaps in AI adoption, promote informed discussions on AI in education, and develop balanced AI integration strategies to improve FL learning. These findings suggest educators and policymakers should implement comprehensive AI training programs and ethical guidelines for responsible AI use in (FL) education.}

Routine knee MRI protocols for 1.5 T and 3 T scanners, do not include T2*-w gradient echo (T2*W) images, which are useful in several clinical scenarios such as the assessment of cartilage, synovial blooming (deposition of hemosiderin), chondrocalcinosis and the evaluation of the physis in pediatric patients. Herein, we aimed to develop an open-source deep learning model that creates synthetic T2*W images of the knee using fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted images.
Materials and Methods
A cycleGAN model was trained with 12,118 sagittal knee MR images and tested on an independent set of 2996 images. Diagnostic interchangeability of synthetic T2*W images was assessed against a series of findings. Voxel intensity of four tissues was evaluated with Bland–Altman plots. Image quality was assessed with the use of root mean squared error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Code, model and a standalone executable file are provided on github.
Results
The model achieved a median NRMSE, PSNR and SSIM of 0.5, 17.4, and 0.5, respectively. Images were found interchangeable with an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.95 for all findings. Mean voxel intensity was equal between synthetic and conventional images. Four types of artifacts were identified: geometrical distortion (86/163 cases), object insertion/omission (11/163 cases), a wrap-around-like (26/163 cases) and an incomplete fat-suppression artifact (120/163 cases), which had a median 0 impact (no impact) on the diagnosis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the developed open-source GAN model creates synthetic T2*W images of the knee of high diagnostic value and quality. The identified artifacts had no or minor effect on the diagnostic value of the images.}

Responses to COVID-19 within medical education prompted significant changes to the surgical clerkship. We analyzed the changes in medical student end of course feedback before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods
Postclerkship surveys from 2017 to 2022 were analyzed including both Likert scale data and free text, excluding the COVID outbreak year 2019-2020. Likert scale questions were compared between pre-COVID (2017-2019) and COVID-era cohorts (2020-2022) with the Mann–Whitney U-test. Free-text comments were analyzed using both thematic analysis and natural language processing including sentiment, word and phrase frequency, and topic modeling.
Results
Of the 483 medical students surveyed from 2017 to 2022, 297 responded (61% response rate) to the included end of clerkship surveys. Most medical students rated the clerkship above average or excellent with no significant difference between the pre-COVID and COVID-era cohorts (70.4% Versus 64.8%, P = 0.35). Perception of grading expectations did significantly differ, 51% of pre-COVID students reported clerkship grading standards were almost always clear compared to 27.5% of COVID-era students (P = 0.01). Pre-COVID cohorts more frequently mentioned learning and feedback while COVID-era cohorts more frequently mentioned case, attending, and expectation. Natural language processing topic modeling and formal thematic analysis identified similar themes: team, time, autonomy, and expectations.
Conclusions
COVID-19 presented many challenges to undergraduate medical education. Despite many changes, there was no significant difference in clerkship satisfaction ratings. Unexpectedly, the greater freedom and autonomy of asynchronous lectures and choice of cases became a highlight of the new curriculum. Future research should investigate if there are similar associations nationally with a multi-institutional study.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
Methods
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9 % placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.
Results
The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.
Conclusion
IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

abstract = {Objectives
Stroke is the second leading cause of global death and is characterized by excitotoxic neuronal death caused by NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor overactivation. The present study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic potential of IC87201, a novel small molecule interfering with the NMDA receptor intracellular signaling pathway, in reducing the extent of ischemic stroke-induced brain damage.
Materials and Methods
Cerebral ischemia was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method in 24 anesthetized adult male rats for one hour. The animals were randomized into sham, MCAO, MCAO+ DXM (Dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate) as an NMDA antagonist, and MCAO+ IC87201 groups which in the last two groups, DXM (50 mg/kg) and IC87201 (10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally after ischemia. The neurobehavioral scores were appraised for 7 days and after that, brain tissue was appropriately prepared to perform the stereological evaluations.
Results
The administration of IC87201 significantly recovered post-ischemia damages, including neurobehavioral function, reduction of volume of the total hemisphere, cortex, and striatum in rat brain, and the percentage of infarcted areas. Additionally, in the striatum region, IC87201 caused an increase in the total number of neuronal and non-neuronal cells as well as a decrease in the total number of dead cells. Some of these parameters were improved by DXM, but in general, IC87201 outperformed that.
Conclusions
IC87201 was successful in minimizing ischemia-induced damage, especially in the striatal region. In addition, IC87201, as a molecule that acts on the intracellular signaling cascade of the NMDA receptor, performed better than DXM, as an antagonist of this receptor.}

Our focus is on the potential impact of ChatGPT on art creation and collaboration. We explore how it has been utilized to generate art and assist in creative writing and how it facilitates collaboration between artists. This exploration includes an investigation into the use of AI in creating art, music, and literature, emphasizing ChatGPT’s role in generating poetry and prose and its ability to provide valuable suggestions for sentence structure and word choice in creative writing. We conduct case studies and interviews with diverse artists and AI experts to understand the benefits and challenges of using ChatGPT in the creative process. Our findings reveal that artists find ChatGPT helpful in generating new ideas, overcoming creative blocks, and improving the quality of their work. It enables remote collaboration between artists by providing a real-time communication and idea-sharing platform. However, ethical concerns relating to authorship ownership and authenticity have emerged. Artists fear using ChatGPT may lead to losing their artistic identity and ownership of their work. While our data suggests that ChatGPT holds the potential to transform the art world, careful consideration must be given to the ethical implications of AI in art. We recommend future research to focus on developing guidelines for the responsible use of AI in art, safeguarding artists’ rights, and preserving artistic authenticity.}

abstract = {Aims
Suicide is a global public health concern, accounting for nearly 700,000 deaths annually. Although well-established risk factors, including mental health disorders, are widely recognized, emerging concerns have surfaced regarding a potential association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), the dual Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 Receptor Agonist tirzepatide and suicidal behavior. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available evidence on the potential association between these drugs and suicidal behavior.
Methods
This review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and APA PsycInfo up to September 24, 2024, using terms related to GLP-1 RAs/GIP/GLP-1 RAs and suicidal behavior.Three independent reviewers conducted article screening and data extraction. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and ROB2 for RCTs.
Results
The review identified 16 studies published between 2017 and 2024, consisting of 5 observational studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 8 pharmacovigilance analyses, and 1 post-hoc analysis of RCTs. No consistent evidence indicated an increased suicide risk among GLP-1 RA users. Pharmacovigilance analyses produced mixed findings; while some disproportionality analyses reported higher rates relative to other antihyperglycemic drugs, no causal link was confirmed. Cohort studies involving diabetic and obese populations generally did not demonstrate a significant increase in suicidal behavior.
Conclusions
Although current data do not warrant changes in prescribing practices, further research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Moreover, the generalizability and reliability of these findings should be interpreted in light of the methodological limitations of the included studies.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Physical inactivity and the global prevalence of diabetes increase disability related to diabetic neuropathy. Physiotherapy techniques—such as infrared radiation, laser therapy, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, electromagnetic waves, whole-body vibration, and therapeutic exercises—are widely used to manage symptoms. Cognitive exercises activating the frontal and prefrontal lobes also help address cognitive decline and depressive symptoms. Motor and cognitive training improve balance and functional performance, but the combined effect of whole-body vibration and cognitive exercises on neuropathic symptoms remains unclear.
Materials and Methods
This randomized controlled trial involved 42 diabetic patients aged 40–75 years with moderate peripheral neuropathy. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) Control receiving routine physiotherapy; (2) Treatment Group 1 performing balance exercises with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); and (3) Treatment Group 2 receiving whole-body vibration (WBV) combined with cognitive exercises. Interventions were performed over ten sessions in four weeks. Functional balance and plantar tactile sensation were evaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and 5.07 monofilament tests. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests (p < 0.05).
Results
All groups showed significant improvement (P < 0.001), with the greatest gains in Group 2, followed by Group 1.
Conclusion
Combining WBV and cognitive exercises yields superior benefits in enhancing plantar sensation and balance in diabetic patients with neuropathy.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the main cause of mortality attributable to air pollution. This study analyzes, for the first time, the association between levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles ≤ 2.5μm in diameter) and hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in hospitals of the Spanish National Health System.
Methods
Data on air pollution, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, covering the period from 2016 to 2021. A total of 122 National Health System hospitals were geographically matched with environmental monitoring stations located within a 10km radius. The study included 115 071 patients aged 18 years or older (mean age, 67 years; 28% women) who were discharged with a diagnosis of AMI during the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to each hospital, and a meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the estimates of the association between PM2.5 levels and variations in AMI hospital admissions. The association between PM2.5 pollution and in-hospital AMI mortality was analyzed using logistic regression models.
Results
Maximum 3-day average PM2.5 levels exceeding 10μg/m3 were associated with an additional 21.9 AMI hospital admissions per 1000 (95%CI, 9.1-34.8; P<.001). Furthermore, PM2.5 levels above 25μg/m3 (3-day moving average) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality due to AMI (OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.07-1.23; P<.001).
Conclusions
This study identifies a significant association between elevated PM2.5 levels and increased hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to AMI in Spain, highlighting the importance of reducing air pollution as a critical factor in cardiovascular health.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La enfermedad vascular ateroesclerótica es la principal causa de mortalidad atribuida a la contaminación atmosférica. Este estudio analiza por primera vez la asociación entre los niveles de contaminación por material particulado ≤ 2,5 μm de diámetro (PM2,5), y la frecuentación y mortalidad hospitalaria por infarto agudo de miocardio (IAM) en hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud en España.
Métodos
Se utilizaron datos de contaminación atmosférica, temperatura y humedad obtenidos del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, recopilados entre 2016 y 2021. Se asociaron 122 hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud con estaciones de mediciones ambientales ubicadas en un radio de 10km mediante coordenadas geográficas. La muestra incluyó a 115.071 pacientes ≥18 años (edad media de 67 años, el 28% mujeres) dados de alta con diagnóstico de IAM durante el periodo de estudio. Se aplicó un modelo autorregresivo integrado de promedio móvil (ARIMA) para cada hospital y un metanálisis para consolidar las estimaciones de asociación entre los valores de PM2,5 y las variaciones en los ingresos hospitalarios por IAM. La asociación de la contaminación por PM2,5 con mortalidad hospitalaria por IAM se analizó mediante modelos de regresión logística.
Resultados
Los niveles de contaminación máxima >10μg/m3 en el promedio de 3 días se asociaron con un aumento de 21,9 por 1.000 ingresos hospitalarios por IAM (IC95%, 9,1-34,8; p<0,001). Además, los valores de PM2,5 >25μg/m3 (media móvil de 3 días previos) se asociaron con un incremento del riesgo de mortalidad hospitalaria por IAM (OR=1,14; IC95%, 1,07-1,23; p<0,001).
Conclusiones
Este estudio establece una asociación significativa entre altos valores de PM2,5 y un aumento tanto en la frecuentación como en la mortalidad hospitalarias por IAM en España, destacando la importancia de abordar la contaminación atmosférica como un factor clave en la salud cardiovascular.}

Analysing natural breathing offers a valuable alternative but requires new methodological approaches. This study introduces anharmonic morphological analysis, a novel technique to characterise breathing cycles, and evaluates its reliability and ability to distinguish healthy individuals from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty healthy individuals (17 men; age 28 ± 5 years; body mass index 21 ± 2 kg/m²) and 119 COPD patients (covering all spirometric GOLD stages) were studied during natural breathing using a linear pneumotachograph. Ventilatory flow traces were analysed using anharmonic morphological analysis, enabling the reconstruction of an average ventilatory cycle for each individual (personal respiratory profile, PRP). Comparisons were performed by calculating Euclidean distances between PRPs. Anharmonic morphological analysis enabled precise and reproducible characterisation of ventilatory cycles. PRPs showed high temporal stability. Tessellation based on Euclidean distances distinguished healthy individuals from COPD patients with a sensitivity of 86 % and a specificity of 94 %. Exploratory analyses further suggested the potential of the method to identify COPD patients responsive to bronchodilator administration based on inspiratory capacity changes. Anharmonic morphological analysis offers a reproducible, physiologically meaningful description of natural breathing and shows promise for future development as a spontaneous-breathing-based tool to assist in diagnosing respiratory disorders without requiring patient cooperation.}

The study finds that the integration of e-commerce into rural areas significantly promotes pension security for the elderly, while financial literacy also effectively enhances their pension security. Moderation effect analysis indicates that financial literacy plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between rural e-commerce and pension security among the elderly, with this moderating effect exhibiting notable heterogeneity across different levels of household debt and marital statuses within the elderly population. The research contributes a fresh understanding of the complex interplay between e-commerce integration in rural settings, individual financial literacy, and the pension security of the elderly. Concurrently, it furnishes empirical evidence crucial for the formulation of policies designed to enhance elder financial stability.}

abstract = {Background
Approximately 89% of the US population lives within five miles of a community pharmacy, which provides a network of geographically distributed recruitment nodes for testing and surveillance of infection and disease.
Objectives
Establish feasibility of Pharmacy-based Research Opportunities To Enhance Community Testing and Surveillance in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community pharmacy setting with University of Kentucky serving as the coordinating center and research hub for sample analysis.
Methods
Two community pharmacies in Kentucky served as community-based recruitment sites to assess SARS-CoV-2 exposure through longitudinal (5 visits over 56 days) collection of nasal swabs and blood samples from subjects.
Results
Fifty subjects were recruited between May 2022 and December 2023 for longitudinal sample collection. Three phases of recruitment were investigated by first establishing standard operating procedures in an urban pharmacy, then expanding recruitment at a second pharmacy in a rural setting, and finally increasing recruitment at the urban pharmacy. During the first phase of recruitment, 12 participants were recruited. Of these participants, two never scheduled a visit after the initial screening. The median time for study completion from first to last visit within this phase was 59 days (interquartile range: 56-68 days). During the second phase of recruitment, eight of nine participants completed all five visits. The median time to complete all visits was 105 days (interquartile range: 98-112 days). During the ongoing third phase, 29 subjects were recruited, and 19 participants completed all required visits and the remainder continue to schedule follow-up appointments.
Conclusion
Community pharmacies have a significant role in promoting public health. The geographic distribution of community pharmacies makes them appealing locations for recruitment of outpatient cohorts for local surveillance of infections and chronic inflammatory conditions with opportunities for broad implementation of this project for clinical trials in underserved communities.}

To determine the value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-image generation learning sequence on higher-education nursing student self-reflection and recognition of unconscious bias in the context of disability.
Background
Self-reflection and recognition of bias amongst undergraduate nursing students enhances reasoning skills and self-awareness in clinical situations. Teaching self-reflection to a diverse cohort can be challenging, making it essential to develop and assess innovative technological tools that support engagement in reflective practice.
Design
A multi-methods approach was adopted, obtaining both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis through a survey.
Methods
Twenty-nine nursing students from the Australian Catholic University were surveyed. Qualitative data underwent both content and inductive thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarised using descriptive statistics. The study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) cross-sectional study guideline.
Results
AI-image generation aided self-reflection on personal views about disability and recognition of potential personal and society biases towards disability amongst 90 % (n = 26) and 70 % of participants respectively. Visualisation of thoughts supported self-reflection and identification of generalisations held about disability. Eighty percent of respondents felt AI-image generation prompted them to consider how views and biases about disability may influence nursing practice. AI-image generation was identified to be an interesting and novel tool for self-reflection.
Conclusion
Findings suggest AI-image generation may be a useful tool in supporting students to practice self-reflection and identify unconscious biases. AI-image generation may assist students to consider how personal views can impact on clinical practice.}

Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB and to compare it with AD.
Design
A single-center cross-sectional study.
Setting
This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 based on the MEMORA cohort.
Participants
Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
Measurements
IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale.
Results
A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60–3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15–5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.73–3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53–3.49), according to the adjusted models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group.
Conclusion
This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized interventions.}

For example, supply chain data are used for analysis of shock propagation through national and global economies as well as for achieving sustainability goals, cross-industry ripple effects become of increasing importance in light of global geopolitical uncertainties, and supply chain resilience analysis takes the lens of global ecosystem viability.

In this paper, we begin with outlining management and economics views on supply chains targeting to identify their commonalities and difficulties. We then classify the existing research on the interface of supply chain management and economics identifying future research areas.}

abstract = {Objective
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity globally. Mobile health technologies may improve HDP management through patient education, facilitating patient-provider communication, and supporting blood pressure self-monitoring through tailored feedback and reminder prompts. Our objective was to understand the digital health needs of women with HDP from low-socioeconomic backgrounds.
Methods
An interactive HDP management digital prototype was developed and evaluated through usability and acceptability testing. Participants included nine pregnant or postpartum women with diagnosed HDP and three maternal-fetal medicine specialists, recruited from two clinics in a predominantly low-income city, Newark, N.J., in 2024 The Technology Acceptance Model was used to guide the assessment of the prototype's acceptability and usability. Data were collected from interviews, a digital literacy questionnaire, and a system usability questionnaire, with quantitative data analyzed descriptively and qualitative data through content analysis.
Results
The median gestational age among pregnant women was 22.0 (17.0, 29.0) weeks, with 89 % identifying as Black/African American. Most women (78 %) reported moderate or high digital health literacy. The mean System Usability score was 81 ± 17, indicating good usability. Three themes were identified: high acceptability and usability, the importance of tailored feedback, and the need for real-time provider-patient communication to support treatment decisions.
Conclusions
These findings indicate a high acceptability and usability of a digital application for HDP management and home blood pressure monitoring among pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with HDP and their providers in a low-income urban setting.}

To improve the performance of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for both uniform linear and planar arrays, an innovative design approach for active coupling radar arrays is proposed. The proposed approach employs active coupling to increase the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and expand the phase difference between array elements, without introducing any additional output loss, by designing appropriate active coupling gains. The experimental results show that the actively-coupled radar array adopting the proposed approach can achieve higher output SNR and narrower beam width than the same array without the proposed technique. Moreover, using the proposed method, the detection SNR threshold can be significantly improved, thus ensuring more accurate DOA estimation. This work paves the way for potentially more accurate DOA estimation in radar systems with limited antenna spacing.}

However, these tools are not appropriate for the co-creation of street design solutions mainly due to the demanding work to create complex designs, the lack of multi-user interfaces, and the inability to create visualizations in real-time. Recently, a few generative AI tools such as UrbanistAI, PlacemakingAI, and Laneform have been developed to overcome these limitations, generating real-time street layout visualizations. These tools aim to enhance stakeholder and citizen involvement in street design processes by allowing citizens to easily modify street layouts and visualize how the street could be in the future. Even though these tools may increase efficiency in design generation, their possible impacts and integration into urban planning practices are poorly questioned and studied. This viewpoint aims to outline a research agenda, discussing the challenges and potential positive and negative effects of using generative AI in participatory decision-making for street designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that discusses the possible benefits and impacts of these generative AI tools for generating future street design. We believe that integrating generative AI street design participation tools into urban planning processes has yet to be thoroughly understood, particularly in their impact on people's creativity and problem-solving, adaptability to different contexts, alignment with recent AI regulations, and implications for equity.}

In other words, in such contributions, the main unknown parameters of the functional model and variance components are estimated sequentially while in our proposed approach, they are estimated simultaneously which leads to a more rigorous solution and also it can be considered as a standard method for VCE in the general nonlinear problems. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm does not require any linearization since here a metaheuristic based method is applied to the VCE problem for the first time. Grey Wolf optimization which is a swarm intelligence method was elected as an efficient simple tool for this goal which outperforms existing well-known metaheuristic methods in literature. The other interesting attainments of the proposed VCE method are that it performs better when the nonlinearity of the problem increases and it is less possible to reach negative variance components. Two geodetic examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides smaller mean squared error (MSE) than the traditional method.}

The article discusses the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI) in research and how AI improves various research methods. This article focuses on the practical case study of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to provide a guideline for employing AI in the process.
Design/methodology/approach
Researchers no longer require technical skills to use AI in their research. The recent discussion about using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a chatbot by OpenAI, has reached the academic world and fueled heated debates about the future of academic research. Nevertheless, as the saying goes, AI will not replace our job; a human being using AI will. This editorial aims to provide an overview of the current state of using AI in research, highlighting recent trends and developments in the field.
Findings
The main result is guidelines for the use of AI in the scientific research process. The guidelines were developed for the literature review case but the authors believe the instructions provided can be adjusted to many fields of research, including but not limited to quantitative research, data qualification, research on unstructured data, qualitative data and even on many support functions and repetitive tasks.
Originality/value
AI already has the potential to make researchers’ work faster, more reliable and more convenient. The authors highlight the advantages and limitations of AI in the current time, which should be present in any research utilizing AI. Advantages include objectivity and repeatability in research processes that currently are subject to human error. The most substantial disadvantages lie in the architecture of current general-purpose models, which understanding is essential for using them in research. The authors will describe the most critical shortcomings without going into technical detail and suggest how to work with the shortcomings daily.}

A total of 259 serum samples were collected from adult goats in 42 family farms in nine communities and tested for indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT, cut-off 1:100). Seroprevalences were 34.36% (89/259) for T. gondii and 64.09% (166/259) for N. caninum. Co-infection was found in 25.86% (67/259) of the goats tested. The most frequent IFAT titer of T. gondii found was 100 (23.93%; 62/259), and only 2% (5/259) of the goats presented titer 800. For N. caninum, the most frequent titers were 100 (25.86%; 67/259), and titers 200 (20.46%; 53/259) and 400 (14.61%, 38/259). The titers found for T. gondii could suggest a chronic infection in goats, being of importance for the region due to meat consumption and cheese production. The elevated seroprevalence of N. caninum identified in this study may be attributed to the community-specific dog population and the close interaction between dogs and goats, despite the absence of a statistically significant association. Subsequent research is warranted to assess the productive implications of T. gondii and N. caninum.}

This study combines Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE), an imaging technique which provides spatially resolved deformation maps across the corneal volume, with Nanoindentation (NI), a technique that relies on direct force measurements at predefined locations on the cornea, to assess corneal biomechanics before and after CXL. Ten human donor corneas were incubated for 24 h in a medium containing 15 % dextran to control hydration and thickness. A custom-made sample mount exerting adjustable retrocorneal fluid pressure enabled ex vivo characterization of the entire cornea while maintaining its natural shape and physiological tension. Each cornea was analyzed with both OCE and NI before and after standard Dresden protocol CXL. Linear mixed-effects models revealed significant CXL-induced stiffening across both methods, most pronounced in the central cornea and a decreasing peripherally. OCE showed a central reduction in axial strain (εzz) of 2.6 ‰ (p < 0.01), while NI revealed a consistent central increase in Hertz elastic modulus (En) of ∼14 kPa (p < 0.01) across both loading rates (300 and 600 μN/min). Although baseline stiffness increased with loading rate (128 kPa vs. 147 kPa), the CXL stiffening effect remained constant. Both techniques confirmed significant regional differences in the CXL response from central to peripheral (p < 0.05). This study provides spatially resolved, quantitative insight into corneal biomechanics using two fundamentally different mechanical testing modalities. The integration of imaging-based OCE with force-based NI establishes a robust experimental foundation for in silico numerical modeling, enabling CXL treatment optimization and predictive simulations.}

abstract = {Background
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a commonly misdiagnosed condition. Driven by cost-consciousness and technological fluency, distinct generations may gravitate towards healthcare alternatives, including artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Our objective was to evaluate the speed and accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5) in the diagnosis of people with NMOSD (PwNMOSD) initially misdiagnosed.
Methods
Misdiagnosed PwNMOSD were retrospectively identified with clinical symptoms and time line of medically related events processed through GPT-3.5. For each subject, seven digital derivatives representing different races, ethnicities, and sexes were created and processed identically to evaluate the impact of these variables on accuracy. Scoresheets were used to track diagnostic success and time to diagnosis. Diagnostic speed of GPT-3.5 was evaluated against physicians using a Cox proportional hazards model, clustered by subject. Logistical regression was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of GPT-3.5 compared with the estimated accuracy of physicians.
Results
Clinical time lines for 68 individuals (59 female, 42 Black/African American, 13 White, 11 Hispanic, 2 Asian; mean age at first symptoms 34.4 years (y) (standard deviation = 15.5y)) were analyzed and 476 digital simulations created, yielding 544 conversations for analysis. The instantaneous probability of correct diagnosis was 70.65% less for physicians relative to GPT-3.5 within 240 days of symptom onset (p < 0.0001). The estimated probability of correct diagnosis for GPT-3.5 was 80.88% [95% CI = (76.35%, 99.81%)].
Conclusion
GPT-3.5 may be of value in recognizing NMOSD. However, the manner in which medical information is conveyed, combined with the potential for inaccuracies may result in unnecessary psychological stress.}

Sarcopenia, characterized by a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength, is increasingly recognized as a major public health concern. Several epidemiological studies have reported that diabetes mellitus is associated with the risk of sarcopenia. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum glycated albumin (GA) levels and the risk of developing sarcopenia and dynapenia in a community-dwelling older Japanese population.
Methods
A total of 905 participants aged ≥65 years without sarcopenia at baseline were followed for 5 years. Serum GA levels were categorized into quartiles. Sarcopenia was defined by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria, and dynapenia was defined as low grip strength or low gait speed. The odds ratios (ORs) of developing sarcopenia and dynapenia and the mean values of percent change of muscle indices with 95 % confidential intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression analysis and analysis of covariance, respectively.
Results
During the follow-up, 73 participants developed sarcopenia. Higher serum GA levels were significantly associated with greater risks of developing sarcopenia (OR 2.65, 95 %CI 0.95–2.65 in the highest vs. the lowest quartile) and dynapenia (OR 4.15, 95 %CI 2.13–4.15). Higher serum GA levels were related to declines in grip strength and gait speed. This association remained significant even among participants without diabetes or with hemoglobin A1c of <6.0 %.
Conclusions
Higher serum GA is a significant risk factor for both sarcopenia and dynapenia, with a stronger association observed for dynapenia, even in the absence of diabetes.}

However, a significant limitation of many existing models is their exclusive reliance on historical motion data, which may lead to undesirable outcomes such as pedestrians intersecting with roadside features. Furthermore, current research predominantly relies on spatial assumptions, making it challenging to adjust the graph arrangement for un-specified environments in online systems, and there is a notable absence of an evaluation methodology to assess the impact of relational modeling on prediction execution. This study addresses these limitations by developing a trajectory prediction model incorporating environmental factors affecting pedestrians. The proposed 3D-dual contextualized model (DCM) utilizes adaptive relational aggregation to capture the intricate relationships between pedestrians and their contextual data. Moreover, integrating a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with the Pedestrian Visual Acuity Module (PVAM) aims to replicate pedestrians’ perception of their surroundings, eliminating extraneous data and reducing computational complexity. Supplementary environmental data was introduced to enrich the information set. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates that the proposed model, incorporating dual-contextualized information such as background and vision information, outperforms the prediction accuracy of cutting-edge baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the 3D-DCM outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly in scenarios with dynamic crowd behavior and environmental influences. This work contributes to the advancement of trajectory prediction by providing a robust framework that incorporates both environmental and visual data, setting the stage for more accurate and scalable applications in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence-based tube feeding (TF) weaning involves reducing the volume of tube feeds to induce hunger, with interdisciplinary monitoring to allow for proactive medical, nutritional, and behavioral intervention as needed. This can be done outpatient; however, the current standard of care requires a high degree of medical monitoring and care coordination, which can be challenging to implement. The CHAMP App is a mobile app designed for remote patient monitoring of children born with congenital heart conditions who are at high risk for medical morbidity and mortality. The CHAMP App remote patient monitoring program would be ideally suited to improve medical monitoring and care coordination.
Objective
This study aims to determine the feasibility of adapting the CHAMP App for children ready to wean from TF.
Methods
We used the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework as a formative tool and conducted a case study beta test.
Results
The level of complexity for the digital innovation’s adaptation supported a high likelihood of success for the TF population. Most issues were simple, such as expanding the types of data that could be entered into the app, and some were more complicated, for instance, training all relevant staff to use and maintain the technology. The case study beta test was conducted with “Greyson”, a 10-month old child weaning from TF (name changed for confidentiality). Once a week, the team reviewed the parent-entered data and communicated with Greyson’s parents, recommending a 25% reduction in tube feeding each week. With the CHAMP App facilitating 2-way communication between the family and the team, Greyson successfully transitioned from receiving 30% of his feeds orally and 70% via tube feeding to 100% oral feedings over the course of 1 month in a home setting.
Conclusions
The CHAMP App is likely to be incredibly valuable in TF weaning. The NASSS framework helped identify key considerations for adapting the CHAMP App for TF weaning at a Midwestern children’s hospital. Interviews with the health care team highlighted issues like data entry expansion and staff training. The framework confirmed TF weaning as a suitable application with no major barriers. The CHAMP App successfully supported a test patient, Greyson, in weaning from his feeding tube. It may improve access, communication efficiency, and satisfaction among families and health care teams while reducing costs and enhancing safety monitoring. The app could also make TF weaning more accessible to families with lower health literacy.}

abstract = {Background
Digital health literacy describes an individual’s ability to use digital information and tools to improve their own health. Understanding how digital health literacy varies across populations could help improve health equity. However, the determinants of digital health literacy have been scarcely evaluated.
Objective
This study aims to assess the levels of digital health literacy in 4 countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) and explore potential associations between digital health literacy and demographic characteristics and self-perceived health status.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated to participants from the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Sweden in December 2020. Digital health literacy was self-reported using the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; range: 0-40); low digital health literacy has been previously defined as an eHEALS score<26. Participant characteristics collected were sex, age group, ethnicity, country, and perceived overall health status. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between these variables and digital health literacy.
Results
A total of 6331 participants were included (51.7% female, n=3272). The mean eHEALS score was 29.2 (SD 6.8). Participant age, sex, health status, and country of residence were included in the final multivariable model. Compared to the 45- to 54-year age group, the 55 years and older age group had lower digital health literacy (β=–1.0; 95% CI –1.4 to –0.5; P<.001), while digital health literacy was higher in those aged 25-34 years (β=0.9; 95% CI 0.3-1.5; P=.002) and 35-44 years (β=0.6; 95% CI 0.1-1.2; P=.03). Better health status was associated with greater digital health literacy (β=0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.4; P<.001). Compared to participants from Germany, those from the United Kingdom (β=2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5; P<.001) and Sweden (β=2.9; 95% CI 2.4-3.4; P<.001) had higher digital health literacy scores, while there was no difference with Italian participants (P=.399). Sex and ethnicity did not have any significant effect on digital health literacy.
Conclusions
This study found significant variations in digital health literacy by age, health status, and country of residence. Targeted educational programs for vulnerable groups, particularly those of older age and poorer health status, are essential. Policies fostering accessible digital health solutions and mitigating health technology–related uncertainties for these populations are crucial for achieving optimal health outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Telemedicine, which incorporates artificial intelligence such as chatbots, offers significant potential for enhancing health care delivery. However, the efficacy of artificial intelligence chatbots compared to human physicians in clinical settings remains underexplored, particularly in complex scenarios involving patients with cancer and asynchronous text-based interactions.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the GPT-4 (OpenAI) chatbot in responding to asynchronous text-based medical messages from patients with cancer by comparing its responses with those of physicians across two clinical scenarios: patient education and medical decision-making.
Methods
We collected 4257 deidentified asynchronous text-based medical consultation records from 17 oncologists across China between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2024. Each record included patient questions, demographic data, and disease-related details. The records were categorized into two scenarios: patient education (eg, symptom explanations and test interpretations) and medical decision-making (eg, treatment planning). The GPT-4 chatbot was used to simulate physician responses to these records, with each session conducted in a new conversation to avoid cross-session interference. The chatbot responses, along with the original physician responses, were evaluated by a medical review panel (3 oncologists) and a patient panel (20 patients with cancer). The medical panel assessed completeness, accuracy, and safety using a 3-level scale, whereas the patient panel rated completeness, trustworthiness, and empathy on a 5-point ordinal scale. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for ordinal ratings.
Results
In the patient education scenario (n=2364), the chatbot scored higher than physicians in completeness (n=2301, 97.34% vs n=2213, 93.61% for fully complete responses; P=.002), with no significant differences in accuracy or safety (P>.05). In the medical decision-making scenario (n=1893), the chatbot exhibited lower accuracy (n=1834, 96.88% vs n=1855, 97.99% for fully accurate responses; P<.001) and trustworthiness (n=860, 50.71% vs n=1766, 93.29% rated as “Moderately trustworthy” or higher; P<.001) compared with physicians. Regarding empathy, the medical review panel rated the chatbot as demonstrating higher empathy scores across both scenarios, whereas the patient review panel reached the opposite conclusion, consistently favoring physicians in empathetic communication. Errors in chatbot responses were primarily due to misinterpretations of medical terminology or the lack of updated guidelines, with 3.12% (59/1893) of its responses potentially leading to adverse outcomes, compared with 2.01% (38/1893) for physicians.
Conclusions
The GPT-4 chatbot performs comparably to physicians in patient education by providing comprehensive and empathetic responses. However, its reliability in medical decision-making remains limited, particularly in complex scenarios requiring nuanced clinical judgment. These findings underscore the chatbot’s potential as a supplementary tool in telemedicine while highlighting the need for physician oversight to ensure patient safety and accuracy.}

To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from >50 published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 µm, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a ≳30 PW laser operating at electron density <1017/cm3.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in various medical domains, prompting an exploration of their potential utility within the high-demand setting of emergency department (ED) triage. This study evaluated the triage proficiency of different LLMs and ChatGPT, an LLM-based chatbot, compared to professionally trained ED staff and untrained personnel. We further explored whether LLM responses could guide untrained staff in effective triage.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the efficacy of LLMs and the associated product ChatGPT in ED triage compared to personnel of varying training status and to investigate if the models’ responses can enhance the triage proficiency of untrained personnel.
Methods
A total of 124 anonymized case vignettes were triaged by untrained doctors; different versions of currently available LLMs; ChatGPT; and professionally trained raters, who subsequently agreed on a consensus set according to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). The prototypical vignettes were adapted from cases at a tertiary ED in Germany. The main outcome was the level of agreement between raters’ MTS level assignments, measured via quadratic-weighted Cohen κ. The extent of over- and undertriage was also determined. Notably, instances of ChatGPT were prompted using zero-shot approaches without extensive background information on the MTS. The tested LLMs included raw GPT-4, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5, and Mixtral 8x7b.
Results
GPT-4–based ChatGPT and untrained doctors showed substantial agreement with the consensus triage of professional raters (κ=mean 0.67, SD 0.037 and κ=mean 0.68, SD 0.056, respectively), significantly exceeding the performance of GPT-3.5–based ChatGPT (κ=mean 0.54, SD 0.024; P<.001). When untrained doctors used this LLM for second-opinion triage, there was a slight but statistically insignificant performance increase (κ=mean 0.70, SD 0.047; P=.97). Other tested LLMs performed similar to or worse than GPT-4–based ChatGPT or showed odd triaging behavior with the used parameters. LLMs and ChatGPT models tended toward overtriage, whereas untrained doctors undertriaged.
Conclusions
While LLMs and the LLM-based product ChatGPT do not yet match professionally trained raters, their best models’ triage proficiency equals that of untrained ED doctors. In its current form, LLMs or ChatGPT thus did not demonstrate gold-standard performance in ED triage and, in the setting of this study, failed to significantly improve untrained doctors’ triage when used as decision support. Notable performance enhancements in newer LLM versions over older ones hint at future improvements with further technological development and specific training.}

It is little understood how EHP infects its host and hijacks its cellular machinery to replicate and exert clinical manifestations in infected shrimp. Since the initial record of HPM, histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays were developed for the detection of EHP to prevent spread of the disease. Availability of an antibody-based detection method would complement these existing diagnostic tools and be useful in studying EHP pathogenesis. We describe here an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for detecting EHP using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were originally developed against Cryptosporidium parvum, a coccidian parasite that infects calves (Bos taurus), other agriculturally important animals, and humans. Forty-one mAbs were screened and two mAbs, 3E2 and 3A12, were found to detect EHP successfully. The utility of these mAbs in detecting EHP was further assessed by testing 36 experimentally challenged EHP-infected shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). EHP-detection data from infected shrimp were compared by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histology, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. The data show IFA using mAbs 3E2 and 3A12 could successfully detect EHP and that the sensitivity of detection is comparable to H&E histology and quantitative PCR. Availability of mAbs that can detect EHP is expected to be immensely beneficial in HPM diagnosis. Since the pathobiology of C. parvum has been so widely studied, these cross-reactive mAbs may also aid in gaining some insight into EHP pathogenesis and disease.}

We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 48 patients with histologically confirmed pT1 NMIBC treated with standard intravesical BCG at two tertiary centers. The median age was 67 years (range: 41–93), 79.2 % were male, 81.2 % had high-grade tumors, 70.8 % had multifocal lesions, and 75.0 % presented tumors > 3 cm. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were obtained prior to BCG and, when available, at recurrence or progression. Immunohistochemical expression of HER-2, SERBP1, HABP4, and IFN-γ was quantified using semi-quantitative scoring and H-scores. Associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression. HER-2 and SERBP1 were significantly overexpressed in BCG-refractory tumors, with high immunorectivities conferring markedly reduced RFS (HER-2: 7.78 vs. 11.71 months, p < 0.001; SERBP1: 7.64 vs. 11.52 months, p < 0.0001) and inferior PFS (p < 0.05). In contrast, high HABP4 and IFN-γ immunorectivities were strongly associated with sustained recurrence- and progression-free survival (both p < 0.0001). Hazard ratios for recurrence and progression exceeded 5.0 for HER-2/SERBP1-high and IFN-γ/HABP4-low profiles. These findings define two molecular phenotypes—immune-evasive versus immune-active—that may inform precision risk stratification, early intervention, and personalized therapeutic decision-making in high-risk NMIBC.}

To examine elevated PSA follow-up within our system and identify areas for improvement in the timely diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Methods
We queried the Mass General Brigham’s Enterprise Data Warehouse from 2018-2021, identifying patients with elevated PSA and documented time to follow-up. Timely follow-up was defined as having a urologist appointment, prostate biopsy, or prostate magnetic resonance imaging within 6 months from diagnosis. We stratified the location of elevated PSA diagnosis to academic medical centers versus community sites. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors impacting follow-up.
Results
We included 28,346 patients, with 50.30%, 15.02%, and 34.69% receiving timely, untimely, and no follow-up during the study period, respectively. In multivariable analysis, patients seen at academic medical centers were more likely to receive follow-up care (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.30-1.48). In a sensitivity analysis including 2 of our largest community hospitals as part of academic medical facilities, those following up at our main sites showed even higher odds of timely follow-up (OR=1.61, 95%CI 1.51-1.73).
Conclusion
Our study observed variations in follow-up rate between our academic medical centers and community sites. This finding highlights the need for efforts to improve consistency and timeliness of prostate cancer follow-up care across all facilities. By addressing interfacility disparities, we can facilitate the delivery of timely care to all patients.}

However, little is known about the opinions of persons who have used LLMs for mental health-related problems. Thus, the current work investigated the positive and negative experiences of those who have interacted with ChatGPT for their mental health using posts from relevant Reddit threads (N = 1594). A 33-item coding scheme was applied to code the presence/absence of each item, and coded posts were modeled using an Ising network graph to explore pairwise and groupwise thematic associations of items. Results from the qualitative coding indicated that the codes representing positive sentiment, experiencing affect/emotion, and attaining personal benefit from using ChatGPT for therapy were among the most frequently coded. Moreover, the Ising network model revealed the most important associations were between items representing positive experiences with ChatGPT (e.g., it performs better than a human therapist in some way and is empathetic), negative experiences (e.g., restrictions worsened their mental health), and specific pathologies (e.g., used it for both anxiety and stress). In addition, the node representing ChatGPT as functioning well as a therapist was the most central node in the network Taken together, the current study indicates that, while users endorse several benefits from using ChatGPT for their mental health, they also report significant drawbacks, including restrictions by ChatGPT that can harm them or exacerbate their symptoms. Thus, ChatGPT may be a useful tool for persons not able to receive standard care, but it may not be as beneficial for persons with more severe pathologies or mental health concerns.}

The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of AlOOH-induced post-vaccination granulomas in sheep experimentally infected with SRLVs. Twenty-four male lambs underwent two identical vaccination protocols and were challenged with SRLVs. Granulomas were detected in vaccinated groups only and progressively decreased in size. At post-mortem examination, 91.3% of the granulomas were recovered. Fistulas were present in granulomas following the second vaccination protocol. Central necrosis was present in 58.0% of granulomas and was associated with the vaccine used. Orthokeratotic keratin was seen within granulomas in 47.1% of the lambs. Considering all granulomas studied, significantly higher expression of MR was found compared with A3Z1. Differences in MR expression were related to the type of vaccine and the time since vaccination. A3Z1 expression was upregulated in granulomas from the infected groups. Macrophage polarization may influence SRLV infection of granulomas. While SRLV infection does not influence the architecture of post-vaccination granulomas, it may modulate their immune microenvironment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the complex interactions between AlOOH-induced granulomas and SRLV infection in sheep.}

The decision to electively repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) involves balancing the risk of rupture, peri-procedural death, and life expectancy. Random forest classifiers (RFCs) are powerful machine learning algorithms. The aim of this study was to construct and validate a random forest machine learning tool to predict two year survival following elective AAA repair.
Methods
All patients who underwent elective open or endovascular repair of AAA from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2021 were reviewed. They were assessed using the Vascular Services Quality Improvement Program pathway involving cardiopulmonary exercise testing, contrast enhanced computerised tomography scan, and multidisciplinary assessment. Patients were followed up for at least two years. A RFC was developed using 70% of the dataset and validated using 30% to predict survival for at least two years following AAA repair.
Results
Nine hundred and twenty five patients (n = 836 men; n = 89 women) underwent elective AAA repair; 126 (13.6%) died during the first two years; 11 (1.2%) died peri-procedurally. Variable importance analysis suggested that anaerobic threshold, pre-operative haemoglobin, maximal O2 consumption, body mass index, risk category, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second – forced vital capacity ratio were the most important contributors to the model. Sensitivity and specificity of the RFC for prediction of two year survival following surgery was 96.7% (95% CI 94.4 – 99%) and 67.1% (95% CI 61 – 72%); overall accuracy: 92.6% (95% CI 88 – 95%) (positive predictive value: 0.93, negative predictive value: 0.80); 10 fold cross validation revealed area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.88.
Conclusion
RFCs based on readily available clinical data can successfully predict survival in the first two years following elective AAA repair. Such information can contribute to the risk benefit assessment when deciding to electively repair AAAs.}

abstract = {Background
In the modern era, the use of technology can substantially impact care access. Despite the extent of its influence on several chronic medical conditions related to the heart, lungs, and others, the relationship between one’s access to digital resources and oncologic conditions has been seldom investigated in select pathologies among gastrointestinal and head-neck regions. However, studies on the influence of this “digital inequity” on other cancers pertaining to nasal and paranasal sinus cancer (NPSC) have yet to be performed. This remains in stark contrast to the extent of large data approaches assessing the impact of traditional social determinants/drivers of health (SDoH), such as factors related to one’s socioeconomic status, minoritized race or ethnicity, and housing-transportation status, on prognostic and treatment outcomes.
Objective
This study aims to use the Digital Inequity Index (DII), a novel, comprehensive tool that quantifies digital resource access on an area- or community-based level, to assess the relationship between inequities in digital accessibility with NPSC disparities in prognosis and care in the United States.
Methods
Patients with NPSC from 2008 to 2017 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were assessed for significant regression trends in the long-term follow-up period and treatment receipt across NPSCs with increasing overall digital inequity, as measured by DII. DII was based on 17 census-tract level variables derived from the summarized values overlapping that same time period from the US Census/American Community Survey and Federal Communications Commission Annual Broadband Report. Variables were categorized as infrastructure-access (ie, electronic device ownership, internet provider availability, and income-broadband subscription ratio) or sociodemographic (education, income, age, and disability), ranked, and then averaged into a composite score to encompass direct and indirect factors related to digital inequity.
Results
Across 8012 adult patients with NPSC, males (n=5416, 67.6%) and White race (n=4293, 53.6%) were the most represented demographics. With increasing digital inequity, as measured by increasing total DII scores, significant decreases in the length of long-term follow-up were observed with nasopharyngeal (P<.01) and maxillary sinus cancers (P=.02), with decreases as high as 19% (35.2 to 28.5 months, nasopharynx). Electronic device and service availability inequities showcased higher-magnitude contributions to observed associated regression trends, while the income-broadband ratio contributed less. Significantly decreased odds of receiving indicated surgery (lowest odds ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95, maxillary) and radiation (lowest odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.95, ethmoid) for several NPSCs were also observed.
Conclusions
Digital inequities are associated with detrimental NPSC care and surveillance trends in the United States, even when accounting for traditional SDoH factors. These results prompt the need to include digital factors into the discussion of contextualizing SDoH-based analyses of cancer care disparities, as well as the specific factors from which prospective implementations and initiatives can invest limited public health resources to alleviate the most pertinent drivers of disparities.}

abstract = {The nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) plays a significant role in various cancer-related processes, but its interactions with transcriptional modulators, particularly Promyelocytic Leukemia protein (PML), remain poorly understood. PML, a nuclear scaffold protein, is involved in tumor suppression and transcriptional regulation. This study investigates the interaction between NFATc3 and PML, focusing on the role of SUMOylation and its impact on downstream target genes. In vitro experiments, including mass spectrometry and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), were conducted to explore this interaction. Additionally, constructs with lysine-to-arginine (K→R) mutations at key SUMOylation sites were generated to determine whether PML SUMOylation is necessary for its interaction with NFATc3. We also assessed the impact of NFATc3 SUMOylation on its binding to PML. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were employed to measure the expression of downstream genes (Lgr5 and Olfm4) under NFATc3 and PML overexpression or knockdown conditions. Pharmacological treatment with arsenic sulfide (As4S4) was used to further investigate modulation of the PML-NFATc3 axis. Our findings revealed that the NFATc3-PML interaction is independent of the SUMOylation status of PML. Additionally, mutations in NFATc3 SUMOylation sites did not affect its binding to PML. The PML-NFATc3 axis regulates Lgr5 and Olfm4 expression, and co-expression of NFATc3 and PML synergistically upregulated these genes. Arsenic sulfide treatment reduced this synergistic effect, indicating its potential as a modulator. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of NFATc3 and PML, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in cancer.}

abstract = {Background
The bending or fracture of a tibial intramedullary nail is a rare complication with a paucity of literature regarding available methods of extraction. This systematic review discusses the currently described surgical techniques for extracting deformed tibial intramedullary nails as well any potential associated challenges.
Methods
A review of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases was conducted for articles describing the extraction of deformed tibial intramedullary nails according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Appraisal tool.
Results
24 case reports were identified as describing the extraction of 27 deformed tibial intramedullary nails. The most common methods of removal were the use of hook extractors (29.6 %), standard extraction (14.8 %) and grasping of broken distal segments via forceps (11.1 %). Challenges included nails with small internal diameters, nail segment tilting during extraction, poor capture of the nail, and subsidence of the proximal segment of the nail. Factors to consider during preoperative planning include the type and material of IMN, degree and direction of IMN angulation, and access to instrumentation.
Conclusion
There are a few core methods of removing deformed intramedullary nails depending on the nature of the deformity, nail type, material, and diameter, and tools available to the surgeon. Regardless of technique, extraction of deformed tibial intramedullary nails is associated with satisfactory patient outcomes.

Learners are increasingly subjected to inaccurate visualizations generated using artificial intelligence. Coincidentally, some learning strategies purposely let learners engage with erroneous content. Instructional visualizations can be created in varying levels of perceptual richness (or realism). We conducted the present experiment to assess whether testing using erroneous examples can be a viable strategy for learning tasks depending on their perceptual richness.
Methods
The two factors of testing (with an error-spotting task vs. without) and realism (schematic vs. realistic) were assessed using two retention tests.
Results
Testing with erroneous examples was detrimental when combined with schematic visualizations, but helpful when applied to realistic imagery in one of the tests.
Conclusion
Studying with erroneous examples appears to require a certain level of realism to be an effective method. Exposing learners to inaccurate visualizations such as those generated by artificial intelligence tools may not be problematic as long as this fact is disclosed.}

Drawing upon theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, it proposes a “Creative Project Approach” that integrates generative AI and robotics in ECE. A pedagogical framework is developed, consisting of five key steps: (1) identifying learning needs, (2) facilitating child-robot interaction with teacher guidance, (3) situating AI and robot use in various learning contexts, (4) determining the appropriate level of automation and creativity, and (5) evaluating learning outcomes. The paper suggests that leveraging generative AI and robotics within the Creative Project Approach holds significant promise for fostering engagement and creativity in AI-native children.}

abstract = {Purpose
Artificial intelligence tools such as virtual agents (VAs) and chatbots allow retailers to tailor services and strengthen customer interaction. This study investigates the primary factors shaping customer intentions to use and collaborate with virtual agents, with particular attention to the moderating effect of service task type – support, purchase or complaint.
Design/methodology/approach
This study empirically tests a model in which perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude toward virtual agents (antecedents) influence intention to use and willingness to collaborate (outcomes), with service task type assessed as a moderating variable. The model is evaluated using PLS-SEM based on survey data from 691 service customers.
Findings
The results indicate that (1) perceived usefulness, compared to ease of use, is a stronger antecedent of attitude; (2) attitude significantly influences intention to use and willingness to collaborate with virtual agents; (3) attitude functions as a significant mediator between perceived usefulness and intention to use. In addition, the study establishes that service task type – support, purchase or complaint – acts as a significant moderating factor.
Practical implications
This study shows that customers’ intentions to use and interact with virtual agents are mainly shaped by their attitudes and perceived usefulness, with the type of service task performed acting as a relevant contextual factor.
Originality/value
This study makes a distinct contribution by identifying the significant moderating role of customer service tasks in transforming customer attitudes into intentions to adopt virtual agents, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving VA adoption in retail and service settings.}

Hybrid bonding, a key process in 3D IC packaging, enables high-density interconnections between stacked chips but faces fabrication challenges as the pitch continues to scale down. This study explores the use of nanotwinned Cu (NT-Cu) to enhance hybrid bonding. The thermal expansion of NT-Cu pads in SiO2 vias and the effects of downscaling pad size on expansion behaviors were investigated using in-situ heating atomic force microscopy (AFM). At 200 °C, the 3-μm regular Cu pad expanded uniformly by 3.9 nm, while the 3-μm NT-Cu pads exhibited uneven expansion, with the periphery expanding by 11.7 nm and the center expanding by 2.6 nm. Despite the uneven expansion, the enhanced expansion in the 3-μm NT-Cu pad is beneficial for broadening the process window for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and hybrid bonding processes. Grain-boundary diffusion was identified as the underlying mechanism behind this behavior. Finally, successful bonding with NT-Cu/SiO2 vias at a low temperature of 200 °C demonstrates their potential for fine-pitch hybrid bonding.}

Here, we predicted HE using machine learning algorithms across 1151 data points, in which the properties of MNPs and microalgae, and conditions of magnetic flocculation were comprehensively considered. Among 8 machine learning algorithms, the optimal XGBoost model showcased the best predictive performance with a high coefficient of determination (0.932), a low mean square error (6.96 %), and a low mean absolute error (4.17 %) on the test dataset. The model was also verified by batch experiments, demonstrating its ability to estimate HE accurately. Further, the Shapley additive explanations approach was used to decipher how the model made predictions from local and global perspectives, and these interpretations may offer guidelines for both the rational design of MNPS and the selection of microalgae species in magnetic flocculation. This work highlights the introduction of machine learning models to predict the harvesting ability of diverse MNPs toward microalgae, paving the way for the utilization of microalgal biomass.}

Viral infections, including those leading to sepsis, are common but often overlooked in clinical practice, yet the treatment strategies for viral sepsis remain inadequately defined.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of antivirals nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in the treatment of culture-negative sepsis.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was conducted across public hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 22, 2022, and June 30, 2023, who had no secondary bacterial or fungal infections. Propensity score matching was used to assess the efficacy of the antivirals nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in patient subgroups with or without organ dysfunction at hospital admission, including circulatory shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, acute liver impairment, a composite of all organ dysfunctions, or no organ dysfunction. Key outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay, reported as hazard ratios (HR) and mean differences, respectively.
Results
The study included 15,599 COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 75.1 (SD 15.9) years. Molnupiravir treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality in patients in both the presence of any organ dysfunction (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96) and without organ dysfunction (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.56). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with decreased mortality with respiratory failure (absolute risk difference: 9.5%, 95% CI 6.26-12.72) and without organ dysfunction (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.56). Antivirals also reduced the length of hospital stay; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced length of stay in respiratory failure by an average of 3.37 (95% CI 2.32-4.42) days, acute kidney injury by 7.25 (95% CI 2.97-11.52) days, and coagulopathy by 7.04 (95% CI 2.99-4.05) days. Molnupiravir reduced the length of stay in acute kidney injury by an average of 6.7 (95% CI 2.39-11.08) days and coagulopathy by 5.68 (95% CI 1.20-10.16) days.
Conclusions
Antivirals reduced mortality among hospitalized COVID patients, with the greatest reduction observed in patients without organ dysfunction. Antivirals were also effective in reducing the length of hospital stay.}

abstract = {Background
Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with impairments in various aspects of reward. VIVRE is the first study in patients with MDD receiving antidepressant therapy to include longitudinal assessment of reward behavior using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a validated behavioral paradigm for the objective assessment of reward and effort-based decision-making in patients with MDD.
Methods
Randomized, double-blind study of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) versus desvenlafaxine (50 mg/day) in adults with MDD and partial response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy. Motivation for reward based on the proportion of hard trial choices was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.
Results
There was no difference in the proportion of hard trial choices between the vortioxetine (n = 288) and desvenlafaxine (n = 300) treatment groups at baseline. Minimal change in parameters of reward motivation was seen over the 8-week treatment period in either group. The between-group difference in the proportion of hard trial choices at week 8 was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.97 [95 % CI: 0.82, 1.14]; P = 0.72). Similar results were obtained when controlling for reward probability, reward magnitude, trial number, and sex, or when limiting to the first 50 trials (excluding computer-selected trials).
Limitations
Exploratory analyses evaluating the utility of the EEfRT in clinical populations.
Conclusions
Experience from the VIVRE study suggests that further research is required to fully determine the clinical utility of the EEfRT for assessment of antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Purpose
Epilepsy in children is often associated with impaired quality of life, lower academic achievement, and reduced academic self-concept, as well as an increased risk of depression and anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the possible impact of comorbidities, such as learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on these variables.
Methods
A total of 104 children with epilepsy (CWE) aged 8–15 years, attending mainstream schools, participated in the study. Of these, 45 were diagnosed with LD and/or ADHD. Participants completed the CHEQOL-25 questionnaire to assess quality of life (QoL), the SPAS questionnaire to evaluate academic self-concept, as well as inventories measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms. The data were analyzed to identify differences between subgroups with and without LD/ADHD using a two-sample t-test. Additionally, correlation analysis was conducted to identify other relevant variables influencing QoL, academic self-concept, and depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Results
QoL and academic self-concept were significantly poorer in CWE with LD/ADHD compared to those without comorbidities. QoL showed statistically significant associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and academic self-concept. While depressive symptoms levels in CWE without comorbidities align with those in the general population, CWE with LD/ADHD showed an increased association with depressive symptoms. Although anxiety symptoms were relatively strongly associated with depressive symptoms, their prevalence remains broadly comparable to that of children without epilepsy, regardless of the presence of LD/ADHD.
Conclusion
CWE with LD/ADHD and their families may benefit from focused attention, including targeted counseling and therapeutic interventions. However, specific interventional studies are recommended, based on child-specific findings.}

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge and continues to affect millions worldwide despite decades of control efforts. The disease can remain dormant and symptom-free for long periods, especially in high-risk populations such as household contacts, immunocompromised individuals and people living in crowded environments. Delayed detection of these silent cases fuels ongoing transmission. Chest X-ray imaging is widely used for screening, yet radiographic signs in early TB are subtle and easily confused with other lung conditions. Shortage of trained radiologists, subjective interpretation and limited data further complicate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled automated detection, but conventional convolutional neural networks often require large labelled datasets and struggle to capture global context in images. This paper proposes a machine-learning framework that combines contrastive pretraining with a fine-tuned vision transformer (CPT-TB) for early detection of TB in asymptomatic, high-risk populations. We utilize the publicly available chest X-ray dataset which contains 4200 images, including 3500 normal X-rays and 700 images from TB patients. Contrastive pretraining leverages unlabeled images by creating multiple augmented views and learning representations that bring similar views closer while pushing dissimilar examples apart. A transformer architecture with self-attention is then fine-tuned on the labelled portion of the dataset. The attention mechanism aggregates information across the entire lung field, capturing subtle pathological patterns that are difficult for CNNs to learn. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over standard models. In five-fold cross-validation, CPT-TB achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 98.2 %, accuracy of 95.5 %, sensitivity of 94.9 % and specificity of 96.0 %. These results represent a 4.0 % increase in accuracy compared to a supervised ResNet-50 baseline and a 2.3 % improvement over a supervised vision transformer. Beyond these quantitative gains, attention maps offer interpretable visual cues for clinicians. The proposed CPT-TB framework shows promise for scalable, non-invasive screening and could facilitate active case finding in resource-constrained settings where radiological expertise is scarce.}

There, however, is still a lack of 3D structures of proteins that are difficult to crystallize or proteins in complex with other macromolecules. With the advent of deep learning applications such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, it is becoming possible to obtain 3D structures of proteins from their 1D sequences while also generating models of protein-nucleic acid complexes that have been difficult to capture through traditional methods. In this project, we utilized AlphaFold3 (AF3) to create a large number of predicted complexes of two type IA topoisomerases: human topoisomerase 3 beta (hTOP3B) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I bound to a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Topoisomerases are enzymes responsible for resolving topological barriers that arise during regular cellular activity. Obtaining structures of topoisomerase complexed with a ssDNA will allow us to discover possible sequence preferences of this enzyme and obtain structures that can be used to screen potential inhibitors. Our analysis showed that AF3 can predict the structure of the enzymes, especially the N-terminal domain, with high confidence. However, predicted protein-DNA complexes, especially with longer (> 25-mer) oligos, are unreliable. The models generated with shorter (9-mer) oligos are obtained with improved confidence and the substrates are placed similarly to crystal structures, but they do not reliably replicate the sequence specificity of the DNA binding of topoisomerase observed in biochemical assays and crystal structures.}

TM has two forms: membrane type existing on the cell surface and blood type free in plasma and urine. TM functions as an anticoagulant cofactor for thrombin activation of protein C on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Due to the excellent anti-coagulant effects in modulating the coagulation and fibrinolytic system, the recombinant human soluble TM (rhsTM) has been used for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In addition to anti-coagulation, many studies have shown that TM can also exert anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. TM has a lectin-like domain at its N-terminus that has been shown to exhibit direct anti-inflammatory functions. At the same time, due to its special structure, thrombomodulin plays an important role in vascular-related mechanistic diseases by participating in the regulation of inflammatory pathways, complement, HMGB1, etc. In this article, changes in TM expression in the body after injury, composition of TM structural domains, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects, and related mechanisms of TM were systematically reviewed, to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the potential clinical implications of TM in treating various diseases.}

abstract = {Statement of problem
Lighting conditions are an essential factor for accurately determining tooth color. However, the ideal lighting conditions for determining tooth shade are rarely met and are difficult to quantify. While the use of a standardized daylight lamp D55 can improve accuracy, its high cost limits its use in dental offices. The use of modern operatory treatment units for tooth color determination is promising, as they now allow for the adjustment of light source settings such as color temperature and intensity. However, studies are needed to determine whether they provide accurate color determination.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of visual tooth shade determinations under the adjusted light sources of 2 different dental treatment units in comparison with a standardized daylight lamp D55.
Material and methods
Dental treatment units from 2 manufacturers KaVoLUX 540 LED (LK) and LEDview Plus (LDS) were tested. The light sources of these units were adjusted to match daylight conditions. A daylight lamp (Dialite Color 7; Eickhorst & Co. KG) was used as a control (D55). A total of 49 participants (median age of 25 years, 30 women) underwent the Ishihara screening and received standardized training calibration. A total of 2205 clinical visual tooth shade determinations were performed with the Toothguide Training Box using the Vita 3D-Master shade guide under the 3 different lighting types. Each participant had 15 color determinations made under each of the 3 light settings. Color differences were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and chi-squared tests (α=.05).
Results
The type of lighting used for tooth shade determination had no significant effect on the accuracy of selected shade based on the ΔE00 metric (P=.133). Perfect matches were achieved in 50.8% of the cases under LK, 49.8% under LDS, and 53.6% under D55 light, with no significant difference among percentages (P=.315). Although there was a significant difference in time elapsed for shade determination by light type (P=.004), this difference was not clinically relevant (20.8 seconds for LK, 23.9 seconds for LDS, 21.9 seconds for D55).
Conclusions
The accuracy of color determination for both examined dental operatory lamps was found to be comparable with that of the standard D55 daylight lamp when adjusted to specific settings.}

abstract = {Introduction
Reducing time between stroke onset and hospital intervention is crucial for positive outcomes in stroke patients. While EMS utilization decreases time to intervention, many US regions are not within timely proximity to an advanced-care-capable stroke center (ASC), defined as a comprehensive or thrombectomy-capable center. This study aims to utilize geographic methodology to identify regions in Wisconsin with both high stroke mortality and low physical accessibility to certified stroke centers (SCs), particularly ASCs.
Methods
Geocoded mortality records for stroke death between 2015 and 2020 were accessed from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Indirectly age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated continuously across Wisconsin using adaptive spatial filtering and mortality records at the census block group level; the surface was then averaged by census tract for tract level SMRs. Addresses for SC locations within Wisconsin and bordering states were collected, and drive times from Wisconsin census tract centroids to the nearest SC subtypes were estimated. Drive times and mortality ratios were evaluated at the tract level alongside Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. Spatial error regression modeling was used to determine RUCA classifications with the highest stroke risk independent of accessibility to stroke centers.
Results
Approximately 50%, 68%, and 78% of Wisconsin residents resided within 30, 45, and 60 minutes of an ASC, respectively. Median drive time from census tract centroids to the nearest ASC were highest for rural tracts (M=90 minutes, IQR=68-115) compared to small-town (M=82 minutes, IQR=49-113), micropolitan (M=53 minutes, IQR=43-77), and metropolitan tracts (M=19 minutes, IQR=11-35; p<0.001). Clusters of high stroke SMRs were found in urban centers as well as rural areas irrespective of county declinations. Spatial regression modeling suggested small-town census tracts had the highest SMR irrespective of physical accessibility to care and spatial correlation. In small-town census tracts >45 minutes from the nearest ASC, the median stroke SMR was 1.12 (IQR=0.94-1.40) with 226,000 residents and 150 stroke deaths per year.
Conclusion
Small-town areas are associated with both long drive distance to ASC locations and high stroke mortality. Geographical analyses reveal apparent stroke care deserts and may inform strategic allocation of emergency medicine resources and coverage.}

abstract = {Background
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) to prevent severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure. Insufficient ATG exposure may reduce its effectiveness in GVHD prophylaxis, while excessive exposure can elevate the risk of viral reactivation, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and disease relapse. Based on monitoring ATG (Thymoglobulin, Sanofi, Lyon, France) concentrations, we developed an ATG-targeted dosing strategy and conducted a prospective, single-arm study on patients undergoing unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (URD-PBSCT) to evaluate its efficacy and safety.
Methods
We enrolled 30 patients with malignant hematological diseases who underwent URD-PBSCT between January 2020 and June 2023. All patients received an ATG-targeted dosing strategy, involving a 4-day administration of ATG: 1.5 mg/kg on day −5, 2.5 mg/kg on day −4, with dose adjustments on day −3 and day −2 to achieve an optimal area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for active ATG. Engraftment, viral infections, acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and survival outcomes were statistically analyzed. A historical cohort of 38 patients who underwent URD-PBSCT between December 2014 and December 2020 was used for comparison. Patients in the historical cohort received a fixed total dose of 10 mg/kg ATG from day −5 to day −2.
Results
All patients in the targeted dosing cohort achieved successful neutrophil and platelet engraftment with 100% donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and persistent CMV viremia at 180 days post-transplantation was 30.0% and 16.7%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and persistent EBV viremia at 180 days were 46.7% and 23.3%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grades II–IV and III–IV acute GVHD at 100 days were 49.4% and 9.3%, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 10.0%, the 1-year NRM was 10.0%, the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 80.0%, and the 1-year overall survival (OS) was 86.7%. Compared with the historical cohort, the targeted dosing cohort showed significantly lower the cumulative incidences of CMV reactivation (30.0% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.001) and persistent CMV viremia (16.7% vs. 42.1%, P = 0.026) on day 180. However, no significant differences were observed in EBV reactivation (46.7% vs. 68.4%, P = 0.170) or persistent EBV viremia (23.3% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.075) on day 180. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in the cumulative incidences of grade II–IV (49.4% vs. 50.3%, P = 0.700) or grade III–IV (9.3% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.390) acute GVHD on day 100, or 1-year chronic GVHD (10.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.680).
Conclusions
Utilizing a targeted ATG dosing strategy in URD-PBSCT resulted in a lower incidence of CMV reactivation and viremia without increasing the risk of acute or chronic GVHD.

keywords = {bloodless cardiac surgery, bloodless heart transplant, heart transplantation, Jehovah's Witnesses},
abstract = {Objective
The study objective was to evaluate the outcomes of bloodless heart transplantation in patients who definitively refuse blood transfusions at a single center specializing in bloodless cardiac surgery.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed all heart transplants at a single center from 2013 to 2024 and identified 53 patients who definitively refuse blood transfusions undergoing bloodless heart transplantation. Bloodless heart transplant recipients received specialized perioperative hemoglobin optimization protocols and perioperative patient blood management strategies, including acute normovolemic hemodilution and specialized surgical techniques to decrease blood loss. Primary outcomes were survival at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years; secondary outcomes were postoperative major complications.
Results
Patients who definitively refuse blood transfusions achieved a mean preoperative hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL before surgery. Preoperative hemoglobin optimization was achieved through the use of erythropoietin (87%) and iron supplementation (68%). Mean nadir hemoglobin after bloodless heart transplantation occurred on postoperative day 3 at 10.3 (9.3-11.8) and increased to 11.3 g/dL (10.2-12.7) at discharge. Patients who definitively refuse blood transfusions did not receive any perioperative blood transfusions. Postoperative complications were low overall with 1 patient (2%) developing primary graft dysfunction, 2 patients (4%) developing a stroke, and 1 patient (2%) developing respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy. Mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years was 2%, 8%, and 33%, respectively.
Conclusions
Bloodless heart transplantation can be performed safely with outcomes comparable to national standards when comprehensive perioperative optimization, blood conservation protocols, and meticulous surgical technique are used. These findings demonstrate that bloodless heart transplantation is a viable option for this traditionally underserved patient population and highlight the potential need for broader adoption of blood conservation strategies across patient populations and centers to expand access to lifesaving therapies.}
