abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are being rapidly adopted for many activities in organizations, business, and education. Included in their applications are capabilities to generate text, code, and models. This leads to questions about their potential role in the conceptual modeling part of information systems development. This paper reports on a panel presented at the 43rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling where researchers discussed the current and potential role of LLMs in conceptual modeling. The panelists discussed applications and interest levels and expressed both optimism and caution in the adoption of LLMs. Suggested is a need for much continued research by the conceptual modeling community on LLM development and their role in research and teaching.}

abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated photos in marketing raises concerns about authenticity, trust, and misinformation. Addressing these challenges requires understanding the differences between AI-generated and human-captured (real) photos and developing effective detection methods. In this study, we compiled a database of AI and real coastal-related tourism photos to analyze their visual differences, and the detection accuracy of both human and deep learning models. While real photos display diverse color schemes and richer textures, AI photos exhibit enhanced brightness and simplified textures. Despite such significant differences in color and texture features, human judgment largely fails to distinguish AI from real photos, resulting in an average accuracy of only 67.7 %. To address this limitation, a hybrid deep learning model was developed, combining a CNN module for image processing and a dense module for integrating explicit visual features. While a single CNN module achieved an accuracy of 92.9 %, largely outperforming human judgment, the inclusion of explicit features further improves the model’s accuracy to 96.1 %, highlighting the importance of multimodal feature integration. The study contributes to understanding the implications of generative AI in marketing, underscores the importance of transparency for online content, and advances methodological approaches for detecting AI-generated visuals.}

This is based on the reports about activation of endogenous PME in plant-based foods by high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment. Fresh orange (Hamlin) peel from a local commercial juice plant was pretreated with HPP at different combinations of pressures and durations, followed by pectin extraction with a commercial method. The effects of HPP pretreatments on pectin yield and structural properties of the extracted pectins were determined. HPP pretreatment increased the yield of subsequent pectin extraction by 41.10 %. Crude extracts from HPP-treated peels showed higher PME activities than the untreated peel. Pectins extracted from HPP pretreated peel (Hp) had a lower degree of methyl-esterification (DM), accompanied by an increase in degree of blockiness (DB) of non-esterified galacturonic acid (GalA) than the control (pectin extracted from un-treated peel). GalA content and linearity of pectin (LP) were higher, while neutral sugar content and degree of branching (DBr) were lower in Hp. The reduction in weight average molecular weight of Hp was minor, and it was positively correlated with a reduction in neutral sugars, indicating an effect of pectin debranching without degradation of the pectin main chain. The effects of HPP on the pectin main chain, degree, and distribution of methyl-esterification in this study were similar to the reported effects of orange PME on extracted pectin. The identified pectin structural features were validated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis and a newly developed lateral flow assay. The study indicates that HPP modification of pectin structure in fresh orange peel before pectin extraction may be an efficient and economical way to generate pectin with desirable structural features and to increase pectin yield.}

However, it is poorly understood whether the gut microbiota involved in the attenuation of liver fibrosis by matrine. Herein we explored a novel mechanism of how oral administration of matrine alleviates liver fibrosis by modulating gut microbiota. Administration of matrine not only potently ameliorated liver fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mice, but also significantly preserved hepatic heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) in vivo and in vitro. Matrine was failed to reduce liver fibrosis when HSP72 upregulation was blocked by the HSP72 antagonist VER-155008. Also, consumption of matrine significantly alleviated gut dysbiosis and fecal metabonomic changes in CCl4-treated mice. Transplanted the faces of matrine-treated mice induced a remarkable upregulation of HSP72 and remission of fibrosis in liver in CCl4-exposed mice and inhibition of TGF-β1-induced inflammatory response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AML-12 cells. Furthermore, deficiency of HSP72 partly reversed the intestinal microbial composition that prevented matrine from reducing CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. This study reveals the "gut microbiota-hepatic HSP72" axis as a key mechanism of matrine in reducing liver fibrosis and suggest that this axis may be targeted for developing other new therapies for liver fibrosis.}

Second, we conducted interpretive content analysis of the curricula of 38 Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accredited supply chain management programs across the world. Third, in-depth interviews with 16 leading academics and industry experts were conducted to conclude the study and draw meaningful insights. Specific solutions aimed at combating the contemporary challenges and the implications of redesigning interdisciplinary curricula for students in specialized business programs – such as supply chains, logistics, and operations – are also offered. This research provides new insights to continuously improve interdisciplinary curricula, enhancing students' employability and contributing to universities’ financial sustainability.}

As open pits, sandboxes in New York City public playgrounds are potentially exposed to fecal inputs from various sources, including wild and domestic animals. A longitudinal study of thirteen sandboxes located in public playgrounds on the east side of Manhattan reveals ubiquity of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci and Escherichia coli through all seasons. The highest concentrations of bacteria occur in surface sand (n = 42; mean enterococci 230 MPN/g and E. coli 182 MPN/g dry weight), with significantly lower levels at depths below the surface (n = 35; mean enterococci 21 MPN/g and E. coli 12 MPN/g dry weight), a stratification consistent with fecal loading at the surface. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that sand depth (surface vs. underlayers) is the most influential variable affecting bacterial levels (P <0.001 for both enterococci and E. coli), followed by sampling season (P <0.001 for both). Bacterial concentrations do not vary significantly as a function of playground location or ZIP code within the study area. Children’s exposure while playing in sandboxes likely reaches 105 enterococci and 104 E. coli in a typical play period. Microbial source tracking to identify fecal hosts reveals dog, bird, and human biomarkers in low concentrations. Open sandbox microcosms installed at ground level in the urban environment of Manhattan are fouled by enterococci and E. coli within two weeks, while adjacent closed microcosms exhibit no fecal contamination over a 33-day sampling period. Collectively, our results indicate that increasing the frequency of sand refills and covering sandboxes during times of disuse would be straightforward management strategies to mitigate fecal contamination in playground sandboxes.}

abstract = {Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are quite popular worldwide due to their low construction costs, despite being susceptible to significant damage even from moderate earthquakes. In many cases, reconstruction may not be the most viable option due to financial and time constraints. Among the available retrofit solutions, steel-reinforced shotcrete (SRS) proves to be a cost-effective, straightforward, yet effective method for repair/retrofitting. This paper presents the results of an experimental study aimed at evaluating the effects of various construction conditions on the rebar pullout resistance of steel-reinforced shotcrete used as a retrofit method for URM walls. To achieve this, a total of 46 full-scale URM specimens were manufactured and tested, each consisting of a one-sided 50 mm-thick shotcrete layer with a single 8 mm steel rebar. The variables examined included the condition of the URM surface before the shotcrete application (wet/dry, with/without finishing including plaster/scratched plaster/oil paint), the condition of the rebar surface (rusty/clean), the type of rebar (plain/ribbed), rebar cover in the shotcrete layer (20/25/30 mm), and the URM substrate temperature before application of shotcrete (20 °C/-16 °C). The results indicate that there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens under the following conditions: when the wall's finishing is removed, the wall's surface is wetted before shotcrete application, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and the temperature of URM before shotcrete application is 20 °C, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 58 %, 56 %, 32 %, and 13 %, respectively. Additionally, when the steel rebar cover is sufficient, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and this rebar is rusted, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 55 %, 10 %, and 6 %, respectively.}

Based on subgroup theory, this study examines the impacts of TMT faultlines on digital transformation and their mechanisms. Analyzing panel data from Chinese listed family firms (2012–2022), we find that TMT identity-based faultlines hinder digital transformation by weakening dynamic capabilities. However, this indirect effect diminishes in highly dynamic environments. Conversely, knowledge-based faultlines promote digital transformation by enhancing dynamic capabilities, with environmental dynamism strengthening the indirect effect. Overall, this study deepens the understanding of the micro drivers of family firms’ digital transformation and provides practical guidance for them to achieve digital transformation.}

However, an important caveat in this approach lies in the lack of reference data, limiting the possibility of developing acoustic biodiversity indices and assessing their sensitivity to environmental change. To address this issue, previous studies have attempted to generate “engineered soundscapes”, that is artificial soundscape recordings which offer some control on, among other aspects, species diversity. Unfortunately, these tools lack complexity and realism, limiting their ecological validity. Here, we introduce Evascape, a Python algorithm informed by available knowledge in soundscape ecology aiming at producing assembled soundscapes with high ecological validity. The algorithm offers the possibility to control biophony (number of species, number of individuals, time organization), geophony (wind and rain with adjustable level), anthropophony (aircraft noise) and sound propagation effects (frequency-dependent attenuation function of the habitat). The algorithm was tested using an acoustic database collected in a protected European cold forest. The generated assembled soundscapes were then used to assess a selection of commonly-used ecoacoustic indices across a large number of controlled scenarios, and to identify the indices that respond most strongly to changes in species richness. Evascape opens the path to other ecoacoustics-related research programs, offering the possibility to design empirical and computational experiments with controlled soundscape parameters.}

abstract = {Background
An increasing number of users are turning to web-based sources as an important source of health care guidance information. Thus, trustworthy sources of information should be automatically identifiable using objective criteria.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to automate the assessment of the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) criteria, enhancing our ability to pinpoint trustworthy health information sources.
Methods
A data set of 538 web pages displaying health content was collected from 43 health-related websites. HONcode criteria have been considered as web page and website levels. For the website-level criteria (confidentiality, transparency, financial disclosure, and advertising policy), a bag of keywords has been identified to assess the criteria using a rule-based model. For the web page–level criteria (authority, complementarity, justifiability, and attribution) several machine learning (ML) approaches were used. In total, 200 web pages were manually annotated until achieving a balanced representation in terms of frequency. In total, 3 ML models—random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)—were trained on the initial annotated data. A second step of training was implemented for the complementarity criterion using the BERT model for multiclass classification of the complementarity sentences obtained by annotation and data augmentation (positive, negative, and noncommittal sentences). Finally, the remaining web pages were classified using the selected model and 100 sentences were randomly selected for manual review.
Results
For web page–level criteria, the random forest model showed a good performance for the attribution criterion while displaying subpar performance in the others. BERT and SVM had a stable performance across all the criteria. BERT had a better area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00 for neutral sentences, justifiability, and attribution, respectively. SVM had the overall better performance for the classification of complementarity with the AUC equal to 0.98. Finally, SVM and BERT had an equal AUC of 0.98 for the authority criterion. For the website level criteria, the rule-based model was able to retrieve web pages with an accuracy of 0.97 for confidentiality, 0.82 for transparency, and 0.51 for both financial disclosure and advertising policy. The final evaluation of the sentences determined 0.88 of precision and the agreement level of reviewers was computed at 0.82.
Conclusions
Our results showed the potential power of automating the HONcode criteria assessment using ML approaches. This approach could be used with different types of pretrained models to accelerate the text annotation, and classification and to improve the performance in low-resource cases. Further work needs to be conducted to determine how to assign different weights to the criteria, as well as to identify additional characteristics that should be considered for consolidating these criteria into a comprehensive reliability score.}

Some content quickly reaches considerable popularity because it is accessed and shared on a large scale, especially in social networks, thus having a potential for going viral.

The choice for this combination is justified because in Brazil this process is carried out manually by verification agencies and thus, based on the mapping of the algorithms identified in the literature, an architecture proposal will be developed using artificial intelligence. As a methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in the Science Direct and Scopus databases using the keywords "fake news" and "machine learning" to locate reviews and research articles published in Engineering fields from 2018 to 2023. A total of 24 articles were analyzed, and the results pointed out that Facebook and X11Twitter has been renamed to X on July 23, 2023. were the social networks most used to disseminate fake news.

keywords = {emerging adulthood, design thinking, mental health promotion, mental ill-health, needs assessment, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
Young adults experience stressors in their transition to adulthood and are at increased risk of mental ill-health. This risk is compounded by young adults’ low levels of mental health literacy and limited competencies in implementing strategies promoting mental health and well-being in their daily lives. Previous research suggests that digital mental health apps may be particularly effective in increasing the mental health literacy of young adults. In Sweden, there is a lack of research on young adults’ unique perspectives on what constitutes mental health, well-being, and ill-health—perspectives that could inform the coproduction of evidence-based interventions targeting these issues.
Objective
The overarching aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment as part of coproducing a digital mental health app for Swedish young adults. More specifically, the study addressed two research questions: (1) What do Swedish young adults perceive as contributing to the mental health, well-being, and ill-health of themselves and their peers? (2) What are Swedish young adults’ preferences and ideas on how a digital mental health app can support their mental health during young adulthood, including their perspectives on the app’s usability?
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 young adults and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Of the 16 study participants, 9 (56%) identified as women and 7 (44%) as men. Their mean age was 23.6 (SD 4.22; range 18-29) years. Furthermore, 56% (9/16) were pursuing or had obtained a higher education degree, while 44% (7/16) had completed or were in the process of completing a high school diploma. The interviews and subsequent analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “To feel that life is worth living”—pathways through pressures and pursuit of mental well-being during young adulthood, (2) “A personal space for working on one’s own mental well-being”—digital companionship with others, and (3) “Something that is designed for me”—customizing one’s digital mental health journey.
Conclusions
In line with the preferences of Swedish young adults, the promotion of mental health and well-being through digital technology and eHealth should focus on a customizable app that supports balance in daily life while strengthening mental health competencies. The content should center on fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships and activities, addressing challenges such as negative social media use and stress recovery, and enhancing mental health knowledge and peer support. Future efforts should focus on researching young adults’ experiences of the life phase of emerging adulthood and its implications for mental health. In addition, future technical development and research on digital mental health apps should include the perspectives of stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, and involve prototype testing with diverse groups to ensure the app’s relevance, user engagement, and effectiveness.}

abstract = {The rising urgency to build climate-resilient infrastructure, particularly in the education sector, has underscored the need for accurate cost prediction tools that support sustainable decision-making. This study proposes a Gene Expression Programming (GEP)-based predictive model to estimate the cost of constructing green resilient school buildings in hot desert climates. The data were collected through structured, on-site questionnaires and interviews with 3687 architects, engineers, and other professionals involved in school infrastructure projects in Bahawalpur and Multan, emphasizing aspects such as design approaches, material selection, energy efficiency, and climate-responsive construction methods. The compiled dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing, which included data cleaning, normalization, categorical variable encoding, and outlier removal. Through expert consultation and statistical correlation techniques, 19 key predictors were identified. Results show that the GEP model delivers high predictive performance R-squared (R2 = 0.81), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.012), Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 0.023) and Mean Square Error (MSE = 0.013) outperforming Decision Tree, SVM and Hybrid models and demonstrating robust generalizability while explaining 81 % of the dataset variance. Feature importance shows that lack of awareness and cost of operations contribute the most to model development. The GEP model was further validated with independent data of 793 professionals (R2 = 0.76), and a Taylor diagram was used to compare with the existing models while generating an interpretable mathematical architecture and expression for cost estimation. The study highlights the potential of evolutionary algorithms like GEP in stakeholder understanding in sustainable school infrastructure projects, thereby contributing to climate adaptation.}

Spray drying based on atomization using high pressure or supercritical CO2 has been shown to be effective in improving therapeutic efficiency of drugs by forming smaller particles, owing to the distinct solvation power and enhanced mixing potential of supercritical CO2. Several parameters contribute to the critical quality attributes of the final atomized pharmaceutical products resulting from CO2-assisted atomization including high-pressure nozzle design, drying chamber geometry, and operating pressures and temperatures. In this context, the work is focused on a detailed analysis of supercritical CO2 through micro-orifices used in a spray drying enhanced atomization process. We present a computational fluid dynamics model, developed using Ansys FLUENT, to describe the flow of pure, pressurized CO2 through a micro-orifice undergoing trans-critical expansion. After establishing grid independence, the computational model was validated by comparing model predictions to measured mass flow rates and temperature distribution of the cooling effect of CO2 free jet over an adiabatic surface. For supercritical inlet conditions and a nozzle orifice size of 80 µm, experimental results matched predictions reasonably well. The simulated results demonstrated the occurrence of shock waves, a prerequisite for fine droplets formation. Simulated results were critically analyzed to develop new insights into intricate fluid dynamics of flow of CO2 through atomization orifices and an attempt is made to evolve specific guidelines. The presented model and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in understanding and optimizing CO2-assisted spray atomization processes.}

Well water nitrate removal and salinity reduction were accomplished via reverse osmosis (RO) based DWTD systems that operated autonomously, supported by remote monitoring and supervisory cyberinfrastructure. Reliable DWTD operation provided treated water quality, with respect to nitrate and salinity, in the range of 0.5–6.3 mg/L NO3−−N and 57–161 mg/L TDS, respectively, which were well below the respective MCL and SMCL. The levelized cost of water treatment was in the range of ∼$2/m3- $2.9/m3 which aligns with typical residential water costs in California and in the study region, and monthly residential water costs ($39-$74/residential unit/month) were also within the range in California. The study showcased the DWTD approach as a viable and potentially scalable solution for upgrading impaired local potable water supply of communities lacking centralized water delivery infrastructure. However, streamlined permitting processes and standardized regulatory frameworks are critical to promoting wider adoption and maximizing the socio-economic benefits of the DWT approach. Moreover, DACs are likely to require government subsidies in order to cover the CapEx of DWTD systems in addition to upgrade of site infrastructure.}

abstract = {Background
The quality and accessibility of menstrual health education (MHE) in low- and middle-income countries, including India, remain inadequate due to persistent challenges (eg, poverty, social stigma, and gender inequality). While community-driven initiatives have sought to raise awareness, artificial intelligence offers a scalable and efficient solution for disseminating accurate information. However, existing general-purpose large language models (LLMs) are often ill-suited for this task, tending to exhibit low accuracy, cultural insensitivity, and overly complex responses. To address these limitations, we developed MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to the Indian context and designed to deliver MHE empathetically, supportively, and accessibly.
Objective
We aimed to develop and evaluate MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to deliver accurate, culturally sensitive MHE—and assess its effectiveness in comparison to existing general-purpose models.
Methods
We curated MENST—a novel, domain-specific dataset comprising 23,820 question-answer pairs aggregated from medical websites, government portals, and health education resources. This dataset was systematically annotated with metadata capturing age groups, regions, topics, and sociocultural contexts. MenstLLaMA was developed by fine-tuning Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation to achieve domain alignment while minimizing computational overhead. We benchmarked MenstLLaMA against 9 state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Mistral. The evaluation followed a multilayered framework: (1) automatic evaluation using standard natural language processing metrics (BLEU [Bilingual Evaluation Understudy], METEOR [Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering], ROUGE-L [Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation-Longest Common Subsequence], and BERTScore [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score]); (2) evaluation by clinical experts (N=18), who rated 200 expert-curated queries for accuracy and appropriateness; (3) medical practitioner interaction through the ISHA (Intelligent System for Menstrual Health Assistance) interactive chatbot, assessing qualitative dimensions (eg, relevance, understandability, preciseness, correctness, and context sensitivity); and (4) a user study with volunteer participants (N=200), who evaluated MenstLLaMA in 15- to 20-minute randomized sessions, rating the system across 7 qualitative user satisfaction metrics.
Results
MenstLLaMA achieved the highest scores in BLEU (0.059) and BERTScore (0.911), outperforming GPT-4o (BLEU: 0.052, BERTScore: 0.896) and Claude-3 (BERTScore: 0.888). Clinical experts preferred MenstLLaMA’s responses over gold-standard answers in several culturally sensitive cases. In medical practitioners’ evaluations using the ISHA—the chat interface powered by MenstLLaMA—the model scored 3.5 in relevance, 3.6 in understandability, 3.1/5 in preciseness, 3.5/5 in correctness, and 4.0/5 in context sensitivity. User evaluations indicated even stronger results, with ratings of 4.7/5 for understandability, 4.3/5 for relevance, 4.28/5 for preciseness, 4.1/5 for correctness, 4.6/5 for tone, 4.2/5 for flow, and 3.9/5 for context sensitivity.
Conclusions
MenstLLaMA demonstrates exceptional accuracy, empathy, and user satisfaction within the domain of MHE, bridging critical gaps left by general-purpose LLMs. Its potential for integration into broader health education platforms positions it as a transformative tool for menstrual well-being. Future research could explore its long-term impact on public perception and menstrual hygiene practices, while expanding demographic representation, enhancing context sensitivity, and integrating multimodal and voice-based interactions to improve accessibility across diverse user groups.}

abstract = {Context:
Test-Driven Development (TDD ) is an agile development approach where the writing of unit tests precedes the writing of production code. Some software engineers have been advocating the use of TDD to develop Embedded Systems (ESs) despite the lack of empirical evidence on TDD applied to ES development.
Objectives:
Our overarching objective is to start building knowledge on TDD applied to ES development. Specifically, we investigated: (i) the claimed benefits of TDD (i.e., increased external quality of ESs and developers’ productivity) and (ii) how developers apply TDD when developing ESs.
Method:
We conducted two empirical investigations. The former investigation, comprising two experiments, aimed to study the claimed benefits of TDD. To that end, we asked Computer Science (CS) Master’s students to fulfill ES development tasks by using TDD or a non-TDD approach. The latter investigation consisted of an ethnographically-informed study to gain insights into how developers apply TDD when developing ESs. In this study, we involved CS Master’s students, who were observed while fulfilling an ES development task. The participants in the two empirical investigations were different.
Results:
We found that the external quality of the developed ESs increased when using TDD as compared to a non-TDD approach, while there was not a substantial difference in developers’ productivity. However, TDD is perceived as more difficult to apply, and the development task is deemed more challenging with TDD. Several patterns emerged about how developers approach TDD when developing an ES (e.g., the participants did not always develop in conformity with TDD).
Conclusion:
TDD seems to be a promising approach to the development of ESs, even though further research is needed. In this regard, we believe that our results can pave the way for future research with the involvement of software companies and professionals.}

Existing adaptation approaches and research informing them largely focus on outcomes of climactic events, but lack consideration of power structures shaping these phenomena and experiences of them. From a feminist peace perspective, I posit that tackling intersectional violences of climate change necessitates greater engagement with underlying knowledge. This paper explores how ways of knowing climate change impact ways of living with it: analyzing the ground on which climate action interventions stand and the paths on which they set us. I theorize ‘climate transformation’ as processual shifts in ways of knowing a problem and solution toward norms of a feminist peace. Theory is developed abductively, based on original fieldwork in Puerto Rico and drawing on conflict transformation theory and elaborating knowledge production through feminist ethics of care. The model developed here enables analyzing orientations of current situations and change processes in relation to desirable futures. I find that actors involved in peace work and climate action in Puerto Rico foster transformation based on: caring in current relations and experience; caring through change processes affectively and reciprocally; and caring for a vision of the future through prefigurative and historicized imagination. The framework advances academic study and policy development on transformative climate action for tackling historic and intersectional violences to influence and enact particular visions of peace.}

We observe a high degree of interconnectedness in the returns of these firms, with equities transitioning between roles as net receivers and transmitters across various market conditions. Notably, the influence of market size is apparent, with larger-cap firms predominantly acting as net transmitters, while smaller-cap counterparts serve as net receivers. We also identify asymmetry between quantiles, particularly evident in left tails, underscoring the significance of idiosyncratic shocks. Our findings have important implications for policy makers, investors and regulators.}

This paper proposes a new curricular approach that intersects data, technology, and design to create an environment where students can evaluate their roles and impact, and interact effectively through data with humans and computational collaborators. This data-oriented curriculum includes foundational technical skills proficiency, data analytical skills, rhetorical skills for arguing with data, interdisciplinary design studies, and a focus on designing for society.

Generally, the quality of a synthetically generated object could refer to the reliability of the content, to the lexical variety or coherence of the text. Regarding the quality of text generation, an aspect that up to now has not been adequately discussed is concerning the readability of textual artefacts. This work focuses on the latter aspect, proposing a set of experiments aiming to better understanding and evaluating the degree of readability of texts automatically generated by an LLM. The analysis is performed through an empirical study based on: considering a subset of five pre-trained LLMs; considering a pool of English text generation tasks, with increasing difficulty, assigned to each of the models; and, computing a set of the most popular readability indexes available from the computational linguistics literature. Readability indexes will be computed for each model to provide a first perspective of the readability of textual contents artificially generated can vary among different models and under different requirements of the users. The results obtained by evaluating and comparing different models provide interesting insights, especially into the responsible use of these tools by both beginners and not overly experienced practitioners.}

This study explored the mechanism of saponin biosynthesis and its role in alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage in the Zhe-Maidong cultivar using three experimental groups undergoing Cd stress. In the Cd-contaminated soil treatment, total saponins were 1.68 times higher than those in the control. The saponin content in the Cd-2 and Cd-3 treatments was approximately twice as high as that in the Cd-CK treatment. These findings revealed that Cd stress leads to total saponin accumulation. Metabolomic analysis identified the accumulated saponins, primarily several monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids. The increased saponins exhibited an antioxidant ability to prevent the accumulation of Cd-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent saponin application experiments provided strong evidence that saponin played a crucial role in promoting superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing ROS accumulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed vital genes for saponin synthesis under Cd stress, including SE, two SSs, and six CYP450s, positively correlated with differentially expressed metabolite (DEM) levels in the saponin metabolic pathway. Additionally, the TF-gene regulatory network demonstrated that bHLH1, bHLH3, mTERF, and AUX/IAA transcript factors are crucial regulators of hub genes involved in saponin synthesis. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory network of saponin synthesis and its role in reducing oxidative damage in O. japonicum when exposed to Cd stress.}

abstract = {Background
The practice of providing patients with digital access to clinical narrative documentation by health care professionals (HCPs) is known as open notes. In mental health care, this innovation has the potential to increase transparency and foster greater trust in the treatment process. While open notes may improve the quality of care and patient engagement, some HCPs are concerned that they may change the nature of clinical documentation and compromise its quality.
Objective
This study aims to examine potential objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation following the implementation of open notes.
Methods
Clinical notes written before and after the implementation of a patient portal with open notes function in 3 psychiatric outpatient clinics in Germany were collected. A total of 876 notes (453 prenotes and 423 postnotes) were rated on 16 linguistic features using a Likert scale. Differences were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In addition, 10 in-depth qualitative interviews with psychiatric HCPs were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Postimplementation significant differences were found in several linguistic features: Monoglossic (P=.002), incomprehensible (P<.001), demeaning (P<.001), stigmatizing (P<.001), factual (P<.001), and controlling (P=.002) language decreased, while comprehensible (P<.001), resource-oriented (P<.001), heteroglossic (P<.001), personal (P<.001), and emotional positive (P=.047) language increased. Interviewed HCPs reported noticeable changes in both their clinical notes and documentation practices. They described reducing the use of medical jargon, providing more detailed explanations, and tailoring documentation to better meet patient needs, resulting in slightly longer notes. However, in the subjective perception of the HCPs, the information they documented in the clinical notes remained mostly the same. HCPs noted an increase in time and workload associated with the new documentation approach, partly due to the workflow adjustments required to adapt to open notes.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically analyze quantitative documentation changes in the field of mental health. The implementation of open notes seems to result in both objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation and documentation practices. Quantitative and qualitative findings from our study suggest that HCPs generally strove to create more patient-friendly notes. In practice, this may benefit both patients and the therapeutic relationship. For open notes to be sustainable in practice, they must be seamlessly and efficiently integrated into HCPs' daily workflows. This requires not only structural changes, but also educating HCPs—both during their training and in clinical practice—on how to write open notes in a way that is both effective and patient-friendly.

It builds on previous studies of concepts of teachers’ PDC, digital transformations in education, and school leadership, supplemented by findings from two empirical studies on school leadership in schools with 1:1 coverage of digital devices. Based on this, the paper presents an initial conceptualisation of PDC for school leaders, illustrating how digital technologies impact both administrative and pedagogical leadership.

The paper presents a framework for implementing the CAD-to-XR workflow. The solution consists of a module for texture generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generated texture is then managed by another module (based on Shrinkwrap modelling) to develop the iPVP by simplifying the 3D model and UV mapping the generated texture. The geometric and material data is integrated into a graphic engine, which allows for programming an interactive experience with the iPVP in XR. The CAD-to-XR framework was validated on two components (rifle stock and forend) of a sporting rifle. The solution can automate the texturing process of different product versions in shorter times (compared to a manual procedure). After each product revision, it avoids tedious and manual activities required to generate a new iPVP. The image quality metrics highlight that images are generated in a “realistic” manner (the perceived quality of generated textures is highly comparable to real images). The quality of the iPVPs, generated through the proposed framework and visualised by users through a mixed reality head-mounted display, is equivalent to traditionally designed prototypes.}

However, building conditional generative systems for multitrack popular songs presents three primary challenges: insufficient fidelity of input conditions, poor structural modeling, and inadequate inter-track harmony learning in generative models. To address these issues, we propose BandCondiNet, a conditional model based on parallel Transformers, designed to process the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality multitrack samples. Specifically, we propose multi-view features across time and instruments as high-fidelity conditions. Moreover, we propose two specialized modules for BandCondiNet: Structure Enhanced Attention (SEA) to strengthen the musical structure, and Cross-Track Transformer (CTT) to enhance inter-track harmony. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations on two popular music datasets with different sequence lengths. Objective results on the shorter dataset show that BandCondiNet outperforms other conditional models in 9 out of 10 metrics related to fidelity and inference speed, with the exception of Chord Accuracy. On the longer dataset, BandCondiNet surpasses all conditional models across all 10 metrics. Subjective evaluations across four criteria reveal that BandCondiNet trained on the shorter dataset performs best in Richness and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in the other three criteria, while significantly outperforming them across all criteria when trained on the longer dataset. To further expand the application scope of BandCondiNet, future work should focus on developing an advanced conditional model capable of adapting to more user-friendly input conditions and supporting flexible instrumentation.}

This study conducts scenario analyses using the global energy models, DNE21+ and DEARS, that served as the basis for the outlook as determined by the government. The scenario analyses focus on the price of energy in Japan relative to prices overseas due to the current status of Japan's CO2 emissions and changes in its industrial structure. The reductions in GDP and steel productions under a low growth scenario which assume conservative technology improvements are 13 % and 41 %, respectively, for achieving the 73 % reduction in emissions. A risk-hedge scenario will achieve emissions reductions of 61 % by 2040 and 79 % by 2050 without such large economic damages. Scenario developments and their implications for energy and emissions reduction policies, i.e., the 7th strategic energy plan, are discussed.}

In spite of the fact that today’s supply chains are global, it is surprising the current research lacks studies primarily focusing on Latin American (LATAM) firms. To enhance our understanding in this domain, this study examines the impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity measures within the LATAM context.
Design/methodology/approach
We use an unbalanced panel of over 2,101 firm-year observations from the Worldscope database between 2010 and 2022 and limit our analysis to firms located in the Latin American region. We use panel data and regression analysis to test our hypotheses.
Findings
The findings reveal a positive impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity.
Originality/value
There is a dearth of research in the discipline primarily focusing on the firms from the LATAM region. The extant literature has largely focused on the Western firms and we know from prior cross-cultural research that there are significant differences in terms of how firms and governments operate differently in emerging and non-Western regions such as LATAM or parts of Asia and Africa. By specifically focusing on a sample of LATAM firms, the study makes important contributions to the extant literature with respect to the role of technology investments in improving inventory turnover, and also on asset turnover and employee productivity. The study further provides implications for practice.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving and is poised to significantly transform the world, affecting nearly every sector and aspect of society. As AI continues to evolve, it is expected to create a more dynamic, efficient and personalized education system, supporting lifelong learning and adapting to the needs and pace of each student. In this research, we focus on testing the model of AI acceptance in higher education (HE) through human interaction-based factors including attitudes, competencies and openness to experience. Perceived benefits were our expectation to enhance AI acceptance in HE.
Design/methodology/approach
To test the model, we collected data from Arab HE institutions by spreading an online questionnaire. The sample consisted of 1,152 of teaching staff and students in Arab region, which were selected randomly. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to determine the interrelated dependence of relationships among variables. Furthermore, processing analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability and validity of questionnaires, multicollinearity and factor loading, in which the items were tested one more time to ensure their validity after translation into Arab language.
Findings
Results reveal that adopted attitude, digital competency and openness to experience have positive and significant relationship with both perceived benefits and AI acceptance in HE in the Arab region. The results also demonstrate the indirect impact of digital factors on AI acceptance in existence of perceived benefits, which was important in the validation of the model.
Originality/value
The research contributes to AI acceptance theory and research by providing evidence of AI acceptance in the Arab region. As generative AI applications continue to expand and change, the way we accept and interact with them will be different. This model could be adopted by authorities to facilitate the acceptance of AI in Arab HE institutions.}

abstract = {Background
Misinformation in health and health care contexts threatens public health by undermining initiatives, spreading dangerous behaviors, and influencing decision-making. Given its reach on online platforms and social media, there is growing demand for interventions addressing misinformation. Literature highlights the importance of theoretical underpinnings (frameworks and models) to guide the development of educational interventions targeting both the features of misinformation and the human traits that increase susceptibility.
Objective
This review examines literature on online interventions targeting health misinformation to mitigate adverse public health impacts. It explores intervention types, population demographics, susceptibility-related human attributes, and misinformation characteristics addressed. It also identifies the theoretical underpinnings used and gaps in the literature.
Methods
The review followed a methodological framework and adhered to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A search strategy combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords was used to search five databases for studies published between 2018 and 2024. Identified studies underwent deduplication, title and abstract screening using predefined eligibility criteria, full-text screening, and data extraction.
Results
The initial search yielded 513 citations; 30 (5.8%) studies were included after screening. Of these, 19 (63%) focused on COVID-19 misinformation, 11 (37%) on other health contexts, and 1 (3%) addressed misinformation conceptually. Regarding intervention type, 22 (73%) used educational courses, 7 (23%) employed counter speech, and 1 (3%) used inoculation games, with some overlap. Sixteen (53%) interventions targeted characteristics of misinformation, categorized as content and presentation tactics, cognitive and psychological biases, social and cultural influences, and dissemination strategies. Seven (23%) interventions focused on specific demographics, while 14 (47%) addressed human attributes that heighten susceptibility. These attributes were grouped into knowledge and processing, emotional and psychological factors, and trust and social dynamics. Theoretical underpinnings guided intervention development in 23 (77%) studies, often overlapping in categories including inoculation and correction, education and cognition, motivation and emotion, behavior and persuasion, trust and belief, and learning design.
Conclusions
Online interventions targeting health misinformation often share outcome goals and use overlapping strategies such as educational courses, counter speech, and inoculation games. Many adopt multifaceted approaches to address misinformation’s complexity. However, gaps remain in tailoring interventions to misinformation characteristics that could improve specificity and impact. Few studies focus on human attributes contributing to belief in and spread of misinformation, particularly among vulnerable groups. While theoretical models are commonly cited, clearer reporting and stronger connections to intervention design are needed. Collaboration among intervention developers, theorists, and psychologists is recommended to enhance future interventions.

Due to complete reliance on natural resources (rock phosphate) for P, the availability of P fertilizers is emerging as a global challenge for crop cultivation. Moreover, the excess application of P fertilizers in rice, mostly grown under flooded conditions, leads to water pollution called eutrophication. In this study, we employed a mutagenesis approach for developing and characterizing rice EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) mutants with better adaptation to low soil P conditions. One such mutant of rice cultivar Nagina 22, named NH4824, was characterized comprehensively at seedling and reproductive growth stages under hydroponic and field conditions. The mutant exhibits low soil P tolerance due to combined adaptive changes in root system architecture, anatomy, organic acid exudates, plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity, induced expression of P transporter genes, and efficient mobilization and partitioning of P in different plant tissues. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and better photosynthesis suggested relatively less stress experienced by NH4824 than N22 under low soil P conditions. These insights are highly useful to develop P use efficient crop cultivars through breeding or genome editing approaches.}

abstract = {Objective
This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between neighborhood social composition and gentrification, and acculturation stressors.
Methods
Person-level data came from first-generation Chinese immigrants enrolled in the Immigrant Enclaves Study (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, baseline 2018–2020, N = 512). A validated scale was used to assess 22 stressors associated with migration or acculturation. Neighborhood characteristics from the American Community Survey 2015–2019 and 2008–2012 included: tract proportion of foreign born Chinese, neighborhood wealth, and past decade gentrification. Most neighborhood exposures were modeled as continuous as well as binary variables (intended to represent highest level of neighborhood exposure). Multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted for age, gender, income, education, employment, language, years in the U.S., and neighborhood variables (proportion co-ethnic, and neighborhood per capita income).
Results
The majority of participants spoke Mandarin (68% vs Cantonese 32%), mean participant age was 52.7 years old, years in the US was 18, and nearly one-half of the sample had less than 8 years of education. Mean number of stressors was 5.9 with nearly 20% of participants reporting 11 or more stressors. Multivariable results found the number of acculturation stressors was 18% lower for residents in the highest co-ethnic density neighborhoods and 13% lower for residents in the highest wealth areas, compared to other areas (expβ 0.82, 95% CI [CI] 0.69, 0.98; expβ 0.87, CI 0.75, 1.01, respectively). Stressors were no different whether participants lived in gentrified areas or not.
Conclusions
Among middle-aged Chinese immigrants, acculturation stress was lower for residents in neighborhoods with higher proportion of Chinese immigrants and for residents in neighborhoods with higher wealth, whereas gentrification had no influence on acculturation stress. More work on this topic is needed with vulnerable populations such as this one, informed by local context.}

Humanitarian relief efforts have gained significant momentum, and there is no denying that digital technologies have played a pivotal role in the success of disaster relief efforts. Despite these successes, humanitarian organizations are sceptical towards the use of digital technologies. Understandably, this scepticism is partly due to the nature of humanitarian organizations. Humanitarian organizations, often established temporarily in response to crises, face management challenges due to the voluntary nature of the work carried out by humanitarian actors. As a result, scholars have sought to propose alternative theories to understand better and explain the intricate nature of humanitarian relief operations. In this chapter, the authors undertake in-depth qualitative research to develop a digital transformation capability framework using the dynamic capability view. The authors also note the limitations and offer numerous research directions for future studies.}

A cross-sectional survey of 166 teachers from public and private schools was conducted, and multiple linear regressions assessed associations among institutional type, locality, prior computer-education training, and engagement with digital materials. Across models, institutional context appears to show the strongest associations. Descriptively, scores were lower among public than private school teachers (i.e., lower for public) and higher among rural than urban teachers; however, regression coefficients for Location (ref. urban) were negative, suggesting lower scores for rural teachers net of covariates, and Perceived Benefit was higher among public than private teachers. Prior computer-education training was positively associated with satisfaction. Teachers who already used digital materials reported lower scores, consistent with a cautious appraisal informed by practical constraints. These results suggest that policy narratives equating hardware distribution with innovation may misdiagnose the problem. In constrained systems, context over hardware appears to condition whether immersive tools can gain traction. Evidence comes from a cross-sectional survey in Fez-Meknes, a region reflecting Morocco's rural/urban and public/private diversity. Generalisation beyond this context should be cautious.}

Problem-solving ability is a key factor in early childhood development, furnishing children with vital cognitive and behavioral strategies for navigating diverse future scenarios. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between participating in household chores and problem-solving abilities among young children and the role of parental scaffolding from the perspective of parent-child interactive dynamics in two steps. First, young children (n = 125, Mage = 4.13-year-old, SD = 0.61) participated in problem-solving tasks, while concurrently, their parents completed a structured questionnaire evaluating children's household chore involvement and parental scaffolding strategies. The second study analyzed the patterns of parental scaffolding using videos of parent-child interactions(n = 31). The results revealed a significant positive correlation between involvement in household chores and problem-solving ability, with parental scaffolding moderating this relationship. Moreover, video analyses revealed a pattern of high-level parental scaffolding during problem solving for household chores. Specifically, parents tended to provide more cognitive scaffolding in the initial stages of problem solving, gradually reduce interventions as the task progressed to allow the child to feel autonomy, and provide high-quality emotional scaffolding throughout the task. These findings highlight the positive effect of participation in household chores on the development of problem-solving abilities among young children as well as the importance of parental scaffolding being provided and withdrawn in a timely manner according to young children's needs.}

However, these systems may be subject to software aging phenomena, leading to progressive performance degradation and potential failures. In this work, we experimentally investigate memory-related software aging in LLM inference. We performed 48-hour experiments with three open-source models (Pythia, OPT, and GPT-Neo) under low, medium, and high workloads, monitoring memory consumption at both system and process levels. Using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator, we observed monotonic growth in RAM usage across all models on Central Processing Units (CPUs), with OPT presenting the steepest slopes. Process-level analysis further revealed that LLM processes were the primary contributors to memory growth, along with background services. Additionally, we conducted identical experiments on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Unlike the experiments without a GPU, GPU-based experiments revealed bounded oscillations and abrupt resets likely due to driver-level memory management, while host RAM and process-level monitoring still revealed clear symptoms of aging. These findings demonstrate that software aging manifests differently across execution environments, reinforcing the need for environment-specific monitoring approaches.}

To develop a targeted and effective treatment aimed at improving the viability of RPE cells we examined small molecular weight thiol-based and levodopa containing molecules. These include the N-acetylcysteine amide (AD4/NACA), SuperDopa-Amide (SDA), and members of the thioredoxin mimetic (TXM) family of peptides, TXM-CB13, TXM-CB30, and SuperDopa (SD). We show that these antioxidant/anti-inflammatory reagents protect ARPE-19 cells from photic stress mediated by rose Bengal (rB) and rhodopsin-rich POS, and from non-photic stress induced by oxidation with sodium iodate. Protection is correlated with a reduction in DPPH radical and singlet-oxygen quenching. Compared to GSH the bimolecular rate-constants of singlet oxygen quenching in aqueous solution by the levodopa derivatives SD and SDA were two-fold higher. Inhibition of auranofin-induced activation of the mitogen-activation-kinases (MAPK's) JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 confirmed the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory activity of the thiol-levodopa derivatives. The antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of TXM-CB13 and TXM-CB30, or SD and SDA, which combine redox activity with elevating cellular levodopa, might offer an efficient protection of RPE cells.

The general objectives of this study were: (1) Determine whether students’ behaviours in the LMS predicted results of their learning in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (2) Determine whether behavioural records (physiological and eye-tracking) produced with integrated multi-channel techniques predicted learning results in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (3) Test whether student behaviours in resources and activities in ALT environments differed depending on the degree type; and (4) Determine whether the results of monitoring student behaviours in ALT environments via integrated multi-channel technology using heat maps and gaze point differed depending on the students’ learning results. The study was performed during one semester with a sample of 64 university students in their final year of health sciences or biomedical engineering degrees. Their learning behaviour in terms of activities and resources in Moodle was monitored along with their use of self-regulated virtual labs for promoting thinking skills. Learning results were assessed using traditional multiple-choice tests and project-based learning assessments (execution and presentation). The results indicate that the variance in the results explained by the use of activities and resources aimed at acquiring thinking skills was greater in project-based learning assessments in both course groups. In addition, the variance explained by the indicators of cognitive load measured by eye-tracking and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) was greater for the learning results in traditional testing. The use of ALT resources and self-regulated virtual laboratories enhanced students’ acquisition of thinking skills. Nonetheless, learning activities must be carefully designed and learning behaviours need to be monitored during the learning process in order to tailor the educational response. This requires better teacher—and student—training in using these resources and in interpreting the resulting records.}

This paper examines an artificial intelligence tutor like ChatGPT, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation, in a pilot project at two universities. The advantage of retrieval-augmented generation in higher education is that lecturers can take control of the underlying literature used by the large language model. Four courses from three programs with different learning objectives and pedagogical methods were involved to provide as diverse a context as possible. We created an artificial intelligence tutor for each course, capable of answering students' questions by referring to the educational resources provided. Both students and lecturers reported positive experiences. Qualitative analysis of the chats shows a high level of engagement and motivation. Based on expert coding of a random sample, 1.5 % of answers were incorrect and 16.5 % were outside the context provided to the large language model. We found that retrieval-augmented generation reduces hallucinations for topics that are sufficiently explained in the material. Both the online survey results and the temporal pattern of the queries showed various learning strategies. Students used the tutor effectively, intuitively finding the most appropriate use for themselves. A comparison of different courses shows that the same tool can work differently in different contexts. Our results show that the artificial intelligence tutor does not simply impart knowledge, but mediates the relationship between student, lecturer, and course material. This mediation can facilitate learning, but it can also pose new challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition affecting the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa, often accompanied by olfactory dysfunction. Eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps (ECRSwNP) is a subtype of CRS characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. Animal models for ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction are necessary for exploring potential therapeutic strategies.
Objective
The aim of this study was to establish a mouse model of ECRSwNP combined with olfactory dysfunction in a shorter time frame using intranasal ovalbumin and Aspergillus protease (AP) administration. The efficacy of the model was validated by evaluating sinonasal inflammation, cytokine levels, olfactory function, and neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb.
Methods
Male BALB/c mice were intranasally administered ovalbumin and AP for 6 and 12 weeks to induce ECRSwNP. The resultant ECRSwNP mouse model underwent histologic assessment, cytokine analysis of nasal lavage fluid, olfactory behavioral tests, and gene expression profiling to identify neuroinflammatory markers within the olfactory bulb.
Results
The developed mouse model exhibited substantial eosinophil infiltration, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in nasal lavage fluid, and confirmed olfactory dysfunction through behavioral assays. Furthermore, olfactory bulb inflammation and reduced mature olfactory sensory neurons were observed in the model.
Conclusion
This study successfully established a validated mouse model of ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction within a remarkably short span of 6 weeks, providing a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis and potential therapies for this condition. The model offers an efficient approach for future research in CRS with nasal polyps and olfactory dysfunction.}

This paper investigates the efficacy of an ILE integrated with ChatGPT in the context of computer networking education. A pilot experiment was conducted with three graduate students with basic IT networking background. The study examined the impact of integrating ChatGPT within the ILE on students’ engagement, comprehension, and overall learning outcomes. Methodological details, including learning program design, learning outcomes assessment, ILE settings, and ChatGPT integration are presented. Results from pre- and post-assessment tests, quizzes, and students’ feedback on ChatGPT’s utility as a learning aid are discussed. The findings suggest a significant improvement in students’ comprehension and performance following their engagement with the ILE while using ChatGPT as a support tool. Despite a few drawbacks reported by the students in terms of the interfaces’ ease of use, and the timely response and appropriate content delivered by ChatGPT, they were overall satisfied with the experience. The students would recommend ChatGPT for learning purposes under certain controlled environments. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on interactive learning technologies and highlights the potential of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT to revolutionize computer networking education in the digital age.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived biospecimens are invaluable tools in biomedical research. Currently, there are no mechanisms for patients to follow along and learn about the uses of their donated samples. Incorporating patients as stakeholders and meaningfully engaging them in biomedical research first requires transparency of research activities.
Objective
In this paper, we describe the use of participatory design methods to build a decentralized biobanking “de-bi” mobile app where patients could learn about biobanking, track their specimens, and engage with ongoing research via patient-friendly interfaces overlaying institutional biobank databases, initially developed for a breast cancer use case.
Methods
This research occurred in 2 phases. In phase 1, we designed app screens from which patients could learn about ongoing research involving their samples. We embedded these screens in a survey (n=94) to gauge patients’ interests regarding types of feedback and engagement opportunities; survey responses were probed during 6 comprehensive follow-up interviews. We then held an immersive participatory design workshop where participants (approximately 50) provided general feedback about our approach, with an embedded codesign workshop where a subset (n=15) provided targeted feedback on screen designs. For phase 2, we refined user interfaces and developed a functional app prototype in consultation with institutional stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance, workflow compatibility, and composability with local data architectures. We presented the app at a second workshop, where participants (n=25, across 9 groups) shared thoughts on the app’s usability and design. In this phase, we conducted cognitive walkthroughs (n=13) to gain in-depth feedback on in-app task navigation.
Results
Most of the survey participants (61/81, 75%) were interested in learning the outcomes of research on their specimens, and 49% (41/83) were interested in connecting with others with the same diagnosis. Participants (47/60, 78%) expressed strong interest in receiving patient-friendly summaries of scientific information from scientists using their biospecimens. The first design workshop identified confusion in terminology and data presentation (eg, 9/15, 60% of co-designers were unclear on the biospecimens “in use”), though many appreciated the ability to view their personal biospecimens (7/15, 47%), and most were excited about connecting with others (12/15, 80%). In the second workshop, all groups found the app’s information valuable. Moreover, 44% (5/9) noted they did not like the onboarding process, which was echoed in cognitive walkthroughs. Walkthroughs further confirmed interest in biospecimen tracking, and 23% (3/13) had confusion about not finding any of their biospecimens in the app. These findings guided refinements in onboarding, design, and user experience.
Conclusions
Designing a patient-facing app that displays information about biobanked specimens can facilitate greater transparency and engagement in biomedical research. Co-designing the app with patient stakeholders confirmed interest in learning about biospecimens and related research, improved presentation of data, and ensured usability of the app in preparation for a pilot study.}

This study presents a scripted, reproducible approach to database curation and explores its potential to streamline oral medicine development. The Product Information files for all centrally authorized drug products containing a small molecule active ingredient were retrieved programmatically from the European Medicines Agency Web site. Text processing isolated relevant information, including the maximum clinical dose, dosage form, route of administration, excipients, and pharmacokinetic performance. Chemical and bioactivity data were integrated through automated linking to external curated databases. The capability of this database to inform oral medicine development was assessed in the context of drug-likeness evaluation, excipient selection, and prediction of oral fraction absorbed. Existing filters of drug-likeness, such as the Rule of Five, were found to poorly capture the chemical space of marketed oral drug products. Association rule learning identified frequent patterns in tablet formulation compositions that can be used to establish excipient combinations that have seen clinical success. Binary prediction models of oral fraction absorbed constructed exclusively from regulatory data achieved acceptable performance (balanced accuracytest = 0.725), demonstrating its modelability and potential for use during early stage molecule prioritization tasks. This study illustrates the impact of highly linked drug product data in accelerating clinical translation and underlines the ongoing need for accuracy and completeness of data reported in the regulatory datasphere.

To address these challenges, we propose a computational framework by utilizing the novel Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) to enhance the accuracy of state estimation for two-phase flow systems in porous media. The forward simulation of the two-phase flow model is implemented using a mixed finite element method, which ensures accurate approximation of the pressure, the velocity, and the saturation. The EnSF leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate filtering distributions efficiently, avoiding the computational expense of neural network-based methods. By incorporating a closed-form score approximation and an analytical update mechanism, the EnSF overcomes degeneracy issues and handles high-dimensional nonlinear filtering with minimal computational overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of EnSF in scenarios with uncertain permeability and incomplete observational data.}

Positive genetic correlations were observed among meat color traits. Intramuscular fat (IMF) was genetically correlated with most meat quality traits, indicating that increasing IMF can favor meat pH, color, and tenderness, but would lead to increased cooking loss. Direct selection to increase IMF of loins is recommended to be included in breeding programs for Hu sheep, as it was more efficient than indirect selection on the other meat quality traits. The genetic parameters presented in this preliminary study provide valuable genetic information needed to design a breeding program aimed at improving the quality of lamb meat from Hu sheep.}

Unlike conventional methods, which treat such a task as an optimization problem, we approach it as an adaption problem to be solved by combining a self-organized multi-agent system (MAS) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The approach involves two steps. The first is design constraints pre-processing, which comprises (a) initial user input, and (b) pre-processing for initial setup. The second is building plan generation, involving (a) perception, (b) planning, and (c) action modules. Multiple illustrative examples are explored to verify the proposed generative design algorithm in terms of robustness, efficiency, and scale. We discover that the algorithm can handle complex combinations of input constraints (e.g., number of rooms, room areas, adjacency connections, and building boundaries) and generate plausible floorplans in a robust, efficient way that can be scaled up to bigger, more complex floorplan generative design problems. With proper adaptation, the algorithm can potentially be applied to other building types, such as office or hospital buildings.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep games are an emerging topic in the realm of serious health game research. However, designing features that are both enjoyable and effective at engaging users, particularly university students, to develop healthy sleep habits remains a challenge.
Objective
This study aims to investigate user preferences for 3 sleep game prototypes, that is, Hero’s Sleep Journey, Sleep Tamagotchi, and Sleepland, and to explore their popularity and perceived utility in promoting sleep health.
Methods
A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a co-design workshop involving 47 university students. Participants were presented with storyboard cards of game features and were asked to provide an overall rating on each game, as well as ratings for individual features. They were also encouraged to provide free-form comments on the features and suggest improvements. In addition, participants were asked to express their preferences among the 3 games regarding which game they would most like to play and which one they found most useful for promoting sleep health.
Results
Surprisingly, while Hero’s Sleep Journey was the most popular choice among participants, Sleep Tamagotchi was perceived as the most beneficial for improving sleep health. Relevance emerged as an overarching theme in the qualitative data analysis, with 3 interconnected dimensions: psychological relevance to users’ personal lives, logical relevance to sleep health, and situational relevance to users’ circumstantial context. We discussed how the 3 dimensions of relevance address the autonomy and relatedness constructs outlined in the self-determination theory and proposed 3 design recommendations.
Conclusions
Our serious sleep game prototypes demonstrated the potential to engage university students to develop healthy sleep hygiene. Future sleep game designs should aim to create a sense of relevance to users’ personal lives, sleep health goals, and situational contexts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, it is essential to develop a wide range of game genres and features to cater to diverse users. Aligning game features with sleep health goals and educating users on the design rationale through sleep knowledge are also important aspects. Furthermore, allowing users to customize their game experience and manage technology boundaries is necessary to nurture a sense of control and autonomy in the process of forming good sleep hygiene.}

Some suggest generative AI could offer decision-makers perspectives they had previously not considered, leading to more equitable and innovative policy approaches, and supporting several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We critique this perspective. Groups may be underrepresented in sustainable development decision-making because of individual cognitive and organisational information-processing limitations (‘omitted, but not opposed’), and because of opposition which remains even if these limitations are overcome (‘opposed, whether omitted or not’). We outline how these ‘categories of omission’ shape the opportunities and risks created by generative AI in representative sustainability.}

This study proposes probability models that convert the natural snowpack stability index estimated by the physical-based snowpack model into the probability of the number of dry-snow avalanches per day. For this purpose, three types of probability models formulated by Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson distributions were developed, assuming that the avalanche occurrences follow a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. In these models, the expected number of avalanches per day increases exponentially with larger unstable snowpack areas where the stability index is below a threshold. Bayesian inference has optimized the models to fit the historical avalanches from the winter of 1958/1959 to the winter of 2011/2012 in December, January, and February in north Japan and Niigata regions. The optimized models largely replicated the probability density function of the number of historical avalanches and their exponential increase with increasing unstable snowpack areas. The posterior predictive checks and the widely applicable information criteria both indicated that the model formulated by Negative Binomial distribution best reproduced the number of historical avalanches. However, the models underestimated the number of avalanches in recent decades due to the nonhomogeneity in the statistical sensitivity of avalanche occurrences to the snowpack instability. We also demonstrated some practical applications of the models, such as predicting avalanche occurrences and reproducing the annual number of avalanches.}

First, we examine the use of a subreddit cannabis cessation community (r/leaves) over time to evaluate the popularity of this type of resource for individuals who want to stop using cannabis. Second, we examine the content of posts in the community to identify popular topics related to cessation. Third, we compare the thematic findings relative to the 4 domains of recovery defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). By examining these 3 gaps, we take the initial steps toward understanding the experiences being shared online among individuals interested in cannabis cessation and compare them with the principles outlined in the SAMHSA definition of recovery.
Methods
Using the Pushshift application programming interface, we collected the count of posts by year between 2011 and 2021 and the narrative of the 100 posts with the most comments per year in a popular cannabis cessation–focused subreddit (r/leaves). A linear model and a nonlinear model were compared to evaluate change in the number of posts by year. Mixed natural language processing and qualitative analyses were applied to identify top terms, phrases, and themes present in posts over time. Overlap between themes and the 4 SAMHSA domains of recovery (health, purpose, community, and home) were examined.
Results
The number of annual posts in r/leaves increased from 420 in 2011 to 34,841 in 2021 (83-fold increase), with exponential growth since 2018. The term that was the most common across posts was “smoke” (2019 posts). Five major themes were identified, and a narrative arc was represented, from motivations and perceived benefits of cannabis use to the negative consequences of use, strategies to change behaviors, and the positive and negative consequences of change. There was substantial overlap between these 5 themes and 3 of SAMHSA’s 4 domains of recovery: health, purpose, and community. However, the domain of home was less commonly identified.
Conclusions
Engagement in this online cannabis support community appears to be increasing. Individuals using this forum discussed several topics, including multiple aspects of recovery defined by the SAMHSA. Online communities, such as this one may, serve as an important pathway for individuals seeking to reduce or cease their consumption of cannabis.}

The albumin nanocomposites were prepared by spray drying method using mannitol alone or in combination with 10 % or 20 % leucine as matrix. After formulation optimization of the albumin nanocomposites, 20 % albumin nanoparticle/70 % mannitol/10 % leucine (20 %NP/70 %M/10 %L) nanocomposite microparticles were selected as the optimized formulation. The nanocomposite comprising this optimized inhalation formulation formed spherical particles with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 25.5 ± 7.7 %. Homogeneous and stable CLZ-HSA-NPs were obtained after re-dispersion in water. Compared with bulk clofazimine, clofazimine-loaded nanocomposites exhibited rapid drug dissolution (74.9 ± 2.7 %, after 15 min). The amount of cellular uptake and the antibacterial effect of clofazimine in the nanocomposite microparticles were comparable to that of clofazimine solution. The albumin nanocomposite particles prepared in this study could be a promising inhalation formulation for clofazimine, a highly hydrophobic drug.}

It draws upon Scott Graham's suggestion for a multidimensional recursive writing process, emphasizing fact-checking and revision while utilizing ChatGPT. Additionally, it incorporates Suresh Canagarajah's (2019) theorization of transnational habits of writing among most international, multilingual, and marginalized students, which, according to him, are characterized by rhetorical sensitivity, depth of awareness, and linguistic knowledge. Based on these empirical and theoretical perspectives, this article proposes pausing, pondering, posing, and prioritizing as critical praxis that can be built into metacognitive activities. To explain this praxis, it showcases two kinds of metacognitive activities for fostering transnational habits among students through fact-checking processes. Similarly, it suggests designing the revision phase of writing assignments to allow students to incorporate their English language skills into the classroom. This paper identifies engaging in critical dialogue with ChatGPT and encouraging self-reflection on fact-checking and revision as effective ways to cultivate a transnational habitus among students. It concludes that adopting a transnational post-digital critical pedagogy and critical AI literacy in the writing process benefits both national and international students by promoting diverse linguistic norms and perspectives.}

Uncertainty at various stages of the visualization pipeline may give rise to misleading visual representations. These comprise misleading elements that may negatively impact the audiences by contributing to misinformed decisions, delayed treatments, and a lack of trust in medical information. We investigate whether visual narratives within the setting of an educational game support recognizing and addressing misleading elements in healthcare-related visualizations. Our methodological approach focuses on three key aspects: (i) identifying uncertainty types in the visualization pipeline which could serve as the origin of misleading elements, (ii) designing fictional visual narratives that comprise several misleading elements linking to these uncertainties, and (iii) proposing an interactive game that aids the communication of these misleading visualization elements to broad audiences. The game features eight fictional visual narratives built around misleading visualizations, each with specific assumptions linked to uncertainties. Players assess the correctness of these assumptions to earn points and rewards. In case of incorrect assessments, interactive explanations are provided to enhance understanding For an initial assessment of our game, we conducted a user study with 21 participants. Our study indicates that when participants incorrectly assess assumptions, they also spend more time elaborating on the reasons for their mistakes, indicating a willingness to learn more. The study also provided positive indications on game aspects such as memorability, reinforcement, and engagement, while it gave us pointers for future improvement.}

abstract = {Wheel hub design is significant in the New Energy Vehicle’s (NEV) aesthetics and user emotional connection. However, the existing design process faces two main challenges: traditional concept methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, and designers’ subjective judgments make it difficult to capture users’ emotional preferences. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been introduced to industrial design. However, conventional GAN-based methods typically require large-scale datasets to achieve high-quality design generation, which limits their applicability in vertical product domains where data are scarce. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an emotional design generation approach for NEV wheel hubs by combining StyleGAN2 with Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (StyleGAN2-ADA) and Whale Optimisation Algorithm-Support Vector Regression (WOA-SVR). First, the StyleGAN2-ADA is trained on a limited NEV wheel hub dataset to achieve automated design generation. Second, Ward hierarchical clustering dentifies representative samples, while morphological analysis deconstructs design features. Subsequently, Factor Analysis (FA) categorises Kansei words to extract principal emotions. After collecting users’ emotional ratings of wheel hubs, WOA-SVR constructs a “design features-emotional needs” mapping model. Finally, the generated images are used to validate the implementation of the generation and prediction models. The case study demonstrates that the proposed method not only generates diverse design alternatives aligned with users’ emotional preferences but also provides reliable predictions of their emotional responses, thereby systematically improving the NEV wheel hub design process while preserving its emotional impact.}

abstract = {Bioretention systems for managing urban runoff rely on healthy plants to reduce runoff and nutrient pollution via evapotranspiration and uptake. However, loss of plant cover is common and, in cold climates, potentially caused by the application of road salt. To investigate the impact of road salt on bioretention systems, we measured salt concentrations in the media and plant tissues and assessed plant cover at 19 sites in Toronto, Canada, in the field. Winter road salt was identified as the primary driver of plant cover loss: low-tolerance species accumulated excessive sodium and chloride, resulting in chlorotic and necrotic damage even under moderate salinity (median electrical conductivity (EC), 0.31–0.35 mS/cm, as measured in soil–water suspensions). Continuous EC monitoring showed no net salt buildup in any season, although salinity peaked in winter and was lower in summer. Low-tolerance species exhibited high salt ion uptake and substantial damage from legacy salt retained in the media. Although species-specific ion accumulation patterns were observed, they did not always align with species salt tolerance as described in the literature. Among the 14 species studied, Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ (low tolerance) and Panicum virgatum (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated sodium, up to 2126 and 586 mg/kg, respectively, whereas Salvia officinalis (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated chloride (up to 20 mg/g); yet only Panicum virgatum displayed minimal damage (<5 %), while Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ and Salvia officinalis displayed >50 % damage. These findings underscore the importance of selecting salt-tolerant species to ensure long-term bioretention performance.}

This work provides a novel approach to boron-doped diamond patterning using nichrome masking for selective seeding on an oxidized silicon substrate. The optimized process involves nichrome deposition, sonication, chemical etching, seeding, and tailored chemical vapor deposition of boron-doped diamond with an intrinsic layer to suppress boron diffusion. Through a systematic investigation, it was determined that isolated boron-doped diamond band electrodes can be efficiently produced on non-conductive silica. Additionally, the influence of boron doping on electrochemical performance was studied, with higher doping enhancing the electrochemical response of band electrodes. To demonstrate sensing capabilities, boron-doped diamond bands were used to detect posaconazole, an antifungal drug, exploiting its electroactive behaviour. A linear correlation between posaconazole concentration and oxidation peak current was observed over 1.43 × 10−8 – 5.71 × 10−6 M with a 1.4 × 10−8 M detection limit. The developed boron-doped diamond microbands could significantly impact the field of electroanalysis, facilitating detection of diverse biologically relevant molecules.

Generative AI (Gen AI) has the potential to mitigate these limitations by enhancing efficiency and standardization, yet its deployment also introduces risks such as algorithmic bias and loss of transparency. This calls for a systematic framework to support strategic decision-making and guide responsible adoption. This study introduces the Maturity–Expectation Gap (MEG) framework, which captures the misalignment between stakeholder perceptions of AI maturity and the actual technological state. Existing models such as the Technology Acceptance Model fail to reflect the temporal and institutional dynamics of emerging technologies. To address this, the study combines expert survey data on perceived maturity with machine learning-based literature analysis to compute expectation scores across twenty-four evaluation criteria. Results show that MEG significantly varies across stakeholder groups, and that higher MEG values are associated with lower confidence in Gen AI adoption, highlighting the framework's utility in explaining strategic adoption decisions (RQ1). Furthermore, MEG enables diagnostic classification of evaluation domains, identifying areas of alignment (e.g., Financial Health) and misalignment (e.g., Decision-Making), thereby supporting phased and risk-aware deployment strategies (RQ2). MEG framework offers a structured lens for managing expectation–capability alignment, extending technology adoption theory while supporting strategic decision-making for the responsible integration of Gen AI in public-sector evaluation systems.}

abstract = {Background
Peer influence is a significant determinant in shaping students' academic performance, yet it is often overlooked in traditional educational strategies. The ability to analyze peer influence and collaboration is an important piece in personalizing student educational experiences.
Objective
This study aims to investigate how peer interactions can be used to predict students' achievement levels and create clusters based on these predictions. Building on these clusters, a novel AI-driven approach is introduced to personalize the learning experiences for each group, providing content aligned with students' predicted achievement levels and ensuring that students receive the right resources throughout their entire education.
Methods
Bi-weekly surveys were conducted throughout the academic year with 45 students enrolled in a computer science program, where students nominated up to five peers they collaborated with the most. The data were used to construct a weighted directed graph (also known as directed network), a type of directed graph allowing multiple edges between the same nodes. Centrality measures were calculated from this directed graph to classify students into low-achieving and high-achieving groups for two-class classification, and into low-achieving, high-achieving, and neutral groups for three-class classification. Generative AI was then utilized to create tailored learning scenarios for each student cluster. For high achievers, the scenario includes providing advanced topics, critical-thinking quizzes and supplementary materials such as research papers and real-world projects. For low achievers, these materials include foundational course materials, multiple-choice quizzes and supplementary materials like videos and step-by-step visualizations. The neutral group was given the option to request specific learning materials and self-assessment quizzes on demand to address their individual learning needs.
Results
Eigenvector centrality of the peer collaboration network was identified as the best predictor of student achievement. To assess students' perceived acceptance of the proposed AI-driven personalization, a questionnaire was distributed. The responses indicated that students found the idea appealing and believed it could enhance their learning experience. Several suggestions for improvement were also provided, which will be used to refine the proposed solution in future iterations. Several improvements to the classification mechanism that can enhance its accuracy and effectiveness were also identified during the process.
Conclusion
The findings of this research provide educators, administrators, and policymakers with essential information that can be used to build targeted interventions and support systems for students early in their studies. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on educational strategies, enhancing positive peer interactions and developing a learning environment that provides support and motivation to all students.}

This shift has impacted English Language Teaching (ELT), leading to the rise of Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT), which advocates a more inclusive and accurate approach to ELT. However, implementing GELT faces significant barriers, particularly the lack of learning materials, which stifles innovation. Digital technologies, especially recent advancements. In Generative AI (GenAI), offer new avenues for overcoming these challenges. Adopting a critical ecological perspective, this study explores the potential and limitations of GenAI in developing and implementing GE-oriented materials from teachers’ perspectives at a secondary school in China. Data collected through reflective journals, classroom observations, roundtable discussions, and video-stimulated recall interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Findings suggest that AI enhances efficiency in material development, supports student-centred design, integrates well with digital resources, and boosts student engagement. However, challenges include rigid curricular structures, AI inaccuracies, technical issues, and AI’s inability to replace teachers’ unique insights. This study argues that AI offers promising support for GE-oriented materials development, with teachers’ unique role remains indispensable in GELT. Methodological, pedagogical, and empirical implications are discussed.}

abstract = {Speech spoofing detection aims to differentiate between real speech and synthetic or altered speech generated through synthesis or conversion techniques. As speech synthesis technology continues to evolve, the number and variety of spoofed speech samples have grown, creating more challenges for detection methods. Existing detection techniques often face the issue of class imbalance in training datasets, which complicates model training and inference. This imbalance also reduces the effectiveness of the decision boundaries, particularly when encountering unknown types of attacks. To address these challenges, we design a novel method called Bidirectional Label Distribution-aware Margin (BLDAM). Our method adjusts decision margins based on the distribution of positive and negative samples, modifying the margin for positive samples based on their quantity and inversely adjusting the margin for negative samples. This helps avoid excessive overlap at the decision boundary or an imbalance in sample compression, thereby improving the regularization and pruning of samples near the boundary. Additionally, we design a Progressive Re-weighting Strategy (PRW), which allows dynamic adjustment of data weights during training, leading to better balance between minority and majority classes. This adjustment strengthens the model’s ability to effectively learn from minority class samples, reducing the risk of overfitting. Our approach achieves error rates of 0.21%, 0.12%, 1.63%, 2.67%, and 5.85% on ASVSpoof 2015-eval, 2019LA-eval, 2021LA-eval, 2021DF-eval, and In The Wild-eval, respectively, without increasing computational resource demands.

Additionally, recent studies have indicated variations in the serum levels of adipokines in pigs with higher fat content, suggest their common interaction. It was therefore hypothesized that ITLN1 regulates the levels of other adipokines and their receptors in the ovary of pigs with different fat content. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effect of ITLN1 (10–100 ng/mL) on the levels of other adipokines, namely adiponectin, apelin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, visfatin, and vaspin in the culture medium, assessed by ELISA. In addition, the effect of ITLN1 on the mRNA expression of the above-mentioned adipokines with their receptors was investigated using RT-qPCR in granulosa cells (Gc) from normal weight Large White (LW) and fat Meishan (MS) pigs on days 10–12 of the estrous cycle. The results showed that ITLN1 reduced apelin levels, increased leptin, and had no effect on vaspin in the culture medium. ITLN1 was found to have a modulating effect on the mRNA expression of the other adipokines with their receptors in porcine Gc.

Questions have arisen about whether the program can achieve its goals and obtain mutual benefits between Korea and participating nations. Using a total quality management (TQM) framework as a unique case analysis, we evaluated ITTP’s resources and performance from 2006 to 2014. Our results show that ITTP has focused on the quantitative promotion of students and alums from various countries and their learning of Korea-centric ICT, policies, and culture. In particular, the Korean government’s lax evaluation of ITTP performance has led to weak responsibility, ambiguous task identity, missed opportunities for self-improvement, and low participation among students and stakeholders. These findings highlight the need for graduate programs and their stakeholders to reinforce internal and external evaluations of the program’s performance and provide feedback for reciprocal development.}

Using data from 461 respondents with prior generative AI experience, we tested AI-generated luxury brand advertisements created using ChatGPT-3.5, Mid-Journey, and Studio DID. Results reveal that perceived artificial creativity positively influences both trust in AI and perceived humanness. These quality dimensions significantly impact advertising attributes, which subsequently affect purchase intentions. The strongest effects on purchase intention were found through informativeness and novelty. This research contributes to our understanding of how AI-generated content influences consumer behavior in luxury advertising contexts and provides practical implications for implementing AI in luxury brand communications.}

This study investigates how PCE, conceptualised through the dimensions of language stylistics, personalisation, and labelling, affects UX outcomes, including performance, task management, and user satisfaction. The sample consisted of 294 respondents from China and Kenya. Using a user-centred approach, this study applies partial least squares structural equation modelling for empirical analysis. The results show that PCE significantly improves UX (β = 0.304, t = 3.965, p < 0.001) and acts as a proxy for implicit human feedback in LLM optimisation. Mediation analysis confirms that data management and prompting experience significantly explain the relationships (p < 0.001), whereas simple slope analysis supports the moderation effects of perceived usefulness, task fit, and quality. The findings suggest that user edits serve as fine-grained feedback signals that enhance personalisation and usability in academic contexts. These results inform the design of more flexible and feedback-aware LLM systems, thereby advancing the development of human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence.}

Current treatments for diabetic painful neuropathy often prove inadequate, necessitating the exploration of new pharmacological approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential antinociceptive effect of aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 (ATL), a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator, when administered alone or in combination with cannabinoid agonists, to alleviate diabetic neuropathic pain. Mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindpaws of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (DBT) rats was assessed using the electronic Von Frey test (VFT), before diabetes induction and for up to 32 days after STZ administration and intraperitoneal ATL (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng/rat) treatment, alone or in combination with intrathecal CB1 or CB2 receptor agonists (ACEA or JWH-133, respectively; 10 or 30 μg/rat). The effect of ATL treatment on locomotor activity and anxious or depressive-like behaviors was also evaluated. In comparison to control normoglycemic rats, control DBT rats developed: 1) mechanical hyperalgesia; 2) increase in anxious and depressive-like behaviors. ATL treatment attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in DBT rats both acutely (at 30 ng) and cumulatively (at doses of 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng), without compromising locomotor activity. The antinociceptive effect of ATL (at 1 or 3 ng) was augmented when combined with ACEA or JWH-133 treatments (only at a dose of 30 μg/rat). While ATL treatment alone reduced anxious-like behavior in DBT rats, it did not affect depressive-like behavior. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of ATL, in diabetic complications, suggesting a possible interaction with the endocannabinoid system.}

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements.

In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe.

These articles were qualitatively analyzed to identify the PSAIS mentioned and their alignment with STEM principles. The PSAIS were then validated by academic and professional experts. The analyses revealed that PSAIS include advanced technological skills, such as knowledge of specialised software, data analysis, big data, and artificial intelligence. In addition, a solid understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts is considered crucial for interpreting and analyzing accounting information.

Methionine γ-lyase (MGL) is the key enzyme involved in the production of VSCs, such as methanethiol and ethanethiol, coinciding with the upregulation of durian MGL (DzMGL) during fruit ripening. Although the VSCs present in durian pulps have been extensively studied, the regulation of genes involved in VSC production in fruit has not yet been explored. Yeast one-hybrid screening of the promoter of durian MGL (pDzMGL) and ca. 1200 Arabidopsis transcription factors (TFs) together with a transcriptomics analysis identified candidate HD-ZIP TF families in durian. Here, dual-luciferase assays, in silico promoter analysis, and electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed to confirm the interaction between pDzMGL and DzHD-ZIP1.8. The results revealed that the ethylene-responsive DzHD-ZIP1.8 localized in the nucleus, where it functioned as an activator and bound to pDzMGL to control its expression during ripening. Therefore, a TF that regulates the expression of DzMGL in durian fruit during ripening was identified in this study. Moreover, this study elucidated the molecular regulation of an important gene involved in VSC production, which affects consumer preferences.}

Existing studies often fail to capture the structural characteristics of crop canopies, such as organ overlapping and resource competition. To address this issue, we propose a 3D maize modeling method based on computational intelligence. An initial 3D maize canopy is created using the t-distribution method to reflect characteristics of the plant architecture. The subsequent model considers the 3D phytomers of maize as intelligent agents. The aim is to maximize the ratio of sunlit leaf area, and by iteratively modifying the azimuth angle of the 3D phytomers, a 3D maize canopy model that maximizes light resource interception can be constructed. Additionally, the method incorporates a reflective approach to optimize the canopy and utilizes a mesh deformation technique for detecting and responding to leaf collisions within the canopy. Six canopy models of 2 varieties plus 3 planting densities was constructed for validation. The average R2 of the difference in azimuth angle between adjacent leaves is 0.71, with a canopy coverage error range of 7% to 17%. Another 3D maize canopy model constructed using 12 distinct density gradients demonstrates the proportion of leaves perpendicular to the row direction increases along with the density. The proportion of these leaves steadily increased after 9 × 104 plants ha−1. This study presents a 3D modeling method for the maize canopy. It is a beneficial exploration of swarm intelligence on crops and generates a new way for exploring efficient resources utilization of crop canopies.}

The innovation capability largely determines the initiative for future development of a region. Higher school is the main position for training innovative talents. Accurate and comprehensive assessment of innovation cultivation capability is an important basis of higher schools for continuous improvement. Thus, this paper focuses on assessing innovative talent cultivation capability. First, by CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product Evaluation), an assessment indicator system is built, consisting of 89 indicators in 21 categories. Then, based on indicator characteristics, this paper uses public data statistics, database retrieving, student survey, teacher survey, support personnel and expert investigation, to collect indicator values. After this, by a powerful machine learning algorithm, gradient Boosting regression tree, a capability assessment model is established. And based on collected data, established model is compared with several regression models in innovative talent cultivation capability assessing.

However, the discrepancy between designer inputs and model-preferred prompts makes it challenging for designers to consistently deliver effective results to end users. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that assists designers in crafting user-centric prompts for T2I models, ensuring that the generated UIs align with end-user expectations. First, this method merges text mining and Kansei Engineering (KE) to analyze online user reviews and construct a Knowledge Graph (KG), mapping the intricate relationships between diverse affective requirements of users, design features, and corresponding text prompts for UI generation. Then, our approach automatically transforms designer inputs into model-preferred prompts through entity mention recognition and entity linking during the human-AI collaborative design process. Finally, we validate the proposed approach with a case study on automotive human–machine interface design. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and expectation disconfirmation. Overall, this study represents a step forward in integrating human and AI contributions in design and innovation within engineering disciplines, enabling AI to inspire, develop, and reinforce human creativity from a human factors perspective.}

While studies have explored ChatGPT's usage, intention, and motivation, few have addressed its paradoxical use from a benefit-risk-coping perspective, leaving gaps in practical and theoretical solutions. This study integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to elucidate ChatGPT's paradoxical use in education. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it aims to provide insights and solutions for managing the benefits, risks, and coping mechanisms associated with ChatGPT in education. Hypotheses and propositions were tested on Taiwanese higher education users (N = 351). Findings from SEM confirm that the perceived threat of ChatGPT's severity decreases the intention to use it, while coping strategies such as self-efficacy and response efficacy strongly predict the intention to use ChatGPT. Additionally, the benefits of performance expectancy and task efficiency significantly increase the intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn significantly increases actual usage behavior. Findings from fsQCA reveal three configurations for both the usage and disusage of ChatGPT in education. The study identifies three constructs with necessary conditions. This research makes a significant theoretical contribution by integrating UTAUT and PMT into a unified framework to elucidate the paradoxical aspects of benefit-risk-coping in the use of ChatGPT. Practical implications for higher educational institutions and their scholars (e.g., students, lecturers, researchers) are also provided through confirmed solutions from the QCA model. These solutions offer strategic insights to leverage the benefits, identify the risks, and cope with the threats associated with using ChatGPT in education.}

Although image-based multi-modal interpretation of BPMN diagrams is also available in such services, our work is motivated by the fact that most BPM systems deliver structured serializations and not images through their APIs; moreover, any data stored in diagrams cannot be scrutinized by computer vision capabilities, being set as annotations in most tools. By exploring both the challenges and effectiveness of utilizing natural language in interacting with BPMN models, the analysis underscores the ability of RDF to mediate semantic richness and open-ended extension of procedural knowledge compared to the closed-world of the XML interchange schemas. Diagrammatic environments are thus encouraged to pursue this as a potential convergence between different means of knowledge representation.}

The components are: learning outcomes include self-system, metacognitive system, and cognitive system; instructional design includes student career development, student skill development, and knowledge and concept learning; and effective video design includes content design, theory-driven design for human-computer interaction, and the use of generative AI. This model guides researchers and practitioners to research and teach business courses using VBL. We also suggested six future research directions, including investigating the relationships between instructional design and learning outcome and the applications of AI in VBL.}

abstract = {Generative AI is increasingly used in team ideation, but how its design features affect creative performance is unclear. Research on human teams suggests that such effects are mediated by team emergent states (TESs, the team's cognitive and emotional dynamics and feelings). Yet, whether TESs play a similar role in team-AI co-ideation remains unknown. This study explored the effects of AI content strategies (breadth-first vs. depth-first) and participation styles (active vs. passive) on TESs and performance during team-AI collaborative ideation by a mixed-design experiment with 52 students and in-depth interviews with seven professionals from industry. In the experiment, two participants and AI as a team brainstormed and developed design solutions. We found depth-first strategies fostered stronger convergence among ideas and members and further enhanced solution completeness, whereas breadth-first AI increased divergent performance and solution practicability. AI design influenced both cognitive and affective TESs, which predicted objective and subjective performance differentially. This study reveals how the design of generative AI affects human-AI collaborative ideation through the perspective of TES and suggests designing generative AI to adjust to TESs and the creative process.}

abstract = {Purpose
In the context of nursing in higher education, digital competencies are increasingly recognised as a necessary skillset, within a continuously evolving healthcare professional landscape. This study sought to explore nursing students’ digital competencies and to further understand the digital literacy gaps and barriers they encounter for both learning and future work.
Design/methodology/approach
The research involved a cross-sectional, discipline-based empirical study of nursing students’ self-assessed digital competencies via a questionnaire survey, which collected quantitative and qualitative data from a total of five hundred and fifty-three students. The study explored the role of demographics (age, urban/rural geographical location of growing up, study year, learning disabilities (neurodiversity)) and experiences of digital divides (e.g., access, contextual and behavioural barriers) play on students’ digital competencies and outcomes.
Findings
Students’ digital competencies were found at an intermediate level, with younger and first-year students self-assessing higher. Significant differences were identified between students who had encountered digital barriers/divides and those who had not, with the former, self-reporting lower digital competencies. Students with learning disabilities reported complex support needs for processing and organizing digital information and for productivity. Almost all the individual digital competencies items assessed had strong statistical correlations between them.
Originality/value
The research offers key recommendations for academic libraries for the ongoing, evolving exploration of students’ digital competencies and for the need to follow tailored, discipline-related, holistic, practice-based and curriculum-embedded approaches to students’ digital skills development and support. It provides novel insights into digital competencies development for nursing students, particularly those who experience digital divides.}

Just transition focuses on protecting jobs, livelihoods and community well-being during transformative shifts related to climate mitigation. Circular economy advocates for a shift in production, consumption and waste management towards a regenerative model that optimises resource efficiency and reduces environmental harm. Despite their differing origins and focuses, both frameworks share a common goal of promoting sustainable livelihoods, adapting to new technologies, and embracing the energy transition. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the thematic convergence and potential for synergy between just transition and circular economy. This paper seeks to fill this gap by identifying key themes that could form the basis of a unified agenda on livelihoods, technology, and justice as part of a new ‘just circularities’ nexus.}

abstract = {The rapid integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education presents both opportunities and challenges in fostering critical questioning – a skill essential for critical thinking and AI literacy. In the context of GenAI, critical questioning refers to the ability to question, probe, and critically assess information generated by GenAI that will equip students with the discernment necessary in a digital world. However, there is limited research on how students develop and apply critical questioning when interacting with GenAI. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the pedagogical and contextual conditions that support high school students in critical questioning with GenAI. Through an action research study situated in a Grade 10 English classroom, the study examines the key conditions that facilitated students’ critical questioning with GenAI. Ethnographic methods were used to generate data from classroom observations, interviews, and student chatlogs that captured how students engaged with GenAI in situ within the classroom environment. A prior critical questioning framework was modified and used to identify instances of critical questioning with GenAI in the data, which were coded along the dimensions of context, delivery, and competency. Findings highlight how the instructional design of AI-mediated interactions, role of the teacher, students’ knowledge and disposition, and the delivery of GenAI platform were crucial in shaping the quality and depth of students’ questioning. These findings indicate that the success of critical engagement with GenAI does not rest on its technological capabilities alone, but on the specific pedagogical and classroom conditions that enable students to use it purposefully and reflectively. By extending our understanding of critical questioning in AI-mediated learning environments, this study provides insights into the conditions that foster AI literacy, which can lead to students actively and critically engaging with AI-generated content rather than passively consuming it.}

abstract = {The efficiency of Photovoltaic (PV) panels is often reduced by defects, leading to performance and lifespan issues, and increased financial losses. Manual inspection methods are labour-intensive and depend on extensive data analysis. Automated defect detection using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging has been investigated in the literature. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous instance segmentation-based analysis was conducted on PV EL images. Moreover, no benchmarking studies have compared instance segmentation models using a standardised dataset for PV defect detection. This study conducts a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of four instance segmentation models, Mask R-CNN, ConvNeXt, ConvNeXt-V2, and Mask2Former against all prior works that utilised the same benchmarking dataset. For the first time, it pioneers the use of ConvNeXt, ConvNeXt-V2, and Mask2Former for PV cell defect detection analysing their architectural innovations and performance. Utilising UCF EL Defect as a benchmarking dataset (one of the largest pixel-level annotated EL datasets), the research categorises defects into cracks, interconnection issues, contact defects, and corrosions. Experiments were conducted using the MMDetection toolbox, providing a modular and reproducible framework for model implementation and evaluation. While instance segmentation was not adopted by prior works, results show that ConvNeXt-V2 outperforms all other models, achieving a segmentation mean Average Precision (mAP) (Intersection over Union (IoU) = 50 %) of 0.602, segmentation mean IoU (mIoU) of 0.650, and bounding box mAP (IoU = 50 %) of 0.629 making it a promising candidate for PV cell defect detection. The code for this work has been made public to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data refer to information systematically reported by patients, or on behalf of patients, without the influence of health care professionals. It is a focal point of the health care system’s ambition toward becoming more involving and personalized. It is recognized that PROs provide valuable data. However, despite this recognition, there are challenges related to both patients’ and clinicians’ accurate interpretations of the quantitative data. To overcome these challenges, this study explores text vignettes as a representation of PROs.
Objective
This study aimed to develop data-informed text vignettes based on data from the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument as another way of representing PRO data and to examine how these are perceived as understandable and relevant for both patients and clinicians.
Methods
The text vignettes were created from participant responses to the READHY instrument, which encompasses health literacy, health education, and eHealth literacy. The text vignettes were created from 13 individual text strings, each corresponding to a scale in the READHY instrument. This study consisted of 3 sequential parts. In part 1, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed the READHY instrument, providing data to be used to create vignettes based on cluster profiles from the READHY instrument. Part 2 focused on the development of scale-based strings representing all READHY dimensions, which were evaluated through iterative cognitive interviews. In part 3, clinicians and patients assessed the understanding and relevance of the text vignettes.
Results
Clinicians and patients both understood and related to the text vignettes. Patients viewed the text vignettes as an accurate reflection of their PRO responses, and clinicians perceived the text vignettes as aligned with their understanding of patients’ experiences.
Conclusions
Text vignettes can be developed using PRO instruments, with individual scales as input strings. This provides an opportunity to present numeric values in a text format that is understandable and recognizable to most patients and clinicians. Challenges with the vignette’s language and layout require customization and clinician training to ensure meaningful interpretation. Findings also support the need to expand the study and enhance clinical relevance with alternative or contextually relevant text vignettes.}

A comparative analysis was conducted along the five main dimensions of variation that Biber (1988) identified. The findings revealed significant disparities between AI-generated and human-authored texts, with the AI-generated texts generally failing to exhibit resemblance to their human counterparts. Furthermore, a linear discriminant analysis, performed to measure the predictive potential of dimension scores for identifying the authorship of texts, demonstrated that AI-generated texts could be identified with relative ease based on their multidimensional profile. Collectively, the results underscore the current limitations of AI text generation in emulating natural human communication. This finding counters popular fears that AI will replace humans in textual communication. Rather, our findings suggest that, at present, AI's ability to capture the intricate patterns of natural language remains limited.}

The work employs Finite element analysis to measure the scaffolds' maximum principal and Von Mises stresses and strains. CT scans of the Maxilla and Mandible were used to apply load conditions to 3D models of the upper central incisor. In the derived computational model, four different load situations considered were: the masticatory load (70–100 N at 45°), two parafunctional habits (100–130 N) and 500–550 N at the incisal edge, both at 45°), and a trauma case (800–850 N applied perpendicularly from the inwards direction at 90°). The findings revealed that the central tooth region experiences the highest stress concentration, while the Maxilla and Mandible regions show the least stress. These results provide critical insights into the mechanical behavior of scaffolds at bone-tissue interfaces, suggesting a research direction for developing scaffolds that closely mimic real bone characteristics. The results of this study are particularly significant for using bone replacement materials, providing an approach to more effective healing options for bone traumas and degenerative bone disorders.}

In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevailing high ambient temperatures should warrant increased daily water intake (DWI) to prevent haemo-concentration and its potential to confound patients' laboratory data.
Aim
To assess the impact that the recommended DWI has on the haemato-biochemical variables in a tropical setting.
Materials and methods
This quasi-experimental study recruited 101 apparently healthy individuals (18–60 years) in the Bawku municipality. DWI, anthropometrics, and haemato-biochemical variables were assessed at baseline. Participants were encouraged to increase their DWI to ≥4 L over a 30-day period; haemato-biochemical variables were re-evaluated. Total body water (TBW) was anthropometrically estimated.
Results
The median post-treatment DWI significantly increased; consequently, anaemia cases increased by >20-fold (2.0 % vs 47.5 % post-treatment). RBC count, platelet count, WBC count, and median haemoglobin significantly decreased compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Biochemically, median plasma osmolality (p < 0.0001), serum sodium (p < 0.0001), serum potassium (p = 0.0012) and random blood sugar (p = 0.0403) significantly decreased. Compared to baseline, significantly higher proportion of participants classified as thrombocytopenic (8.9 % vs 3.0 %), hyponatraemia (10.9 % vs 2.0 %), or normal osmolarity (77.2 % vs 20.8 %). There were differential bivariate correlations between pre- and post-treatment haemato-biochemical variables.
Conclusion
Sub-optimal DWI is a likely confounder in haemato-biochemical data interpretation in the tropics.}
