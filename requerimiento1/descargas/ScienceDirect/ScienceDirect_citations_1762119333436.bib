abstract = {Increasing the efficiency of charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers are still the main challenges in the field of semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Herein, we synthesized g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst by modifying g-C3N4 using V2C MXene. The prepared photocatalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance under visible light. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange by g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst was as high as 94.5%, which is 1.56 times higher than that by g-C3N4. This was attributed to the V2C MXene inhibiting the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and facilitating rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons (e−) from g-C3N4 to MXene. Moreover, g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst showed good cycling stability. The photocatalytic performance was higher than 85% after three cycles. Experiments to capture free radicals revealed that superoxide radicals (·O2−) are the main contributors to the photocatalytic activity. Thus, the proposed g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst is a promising visible-light catalyst.}

abstract = {The paper deals with a novel methodology for determining the mean translational velocity of groundwater flow and application in the Dinaric karst of Croatia. Until now, it has only been possible to calculate the apparent velocity of groundwater flow in the karst system after obtaining experimental field investigation to verify e.g. the movement of pollution through the underground karst system, by applying the dye-tracing test technique using a dye tracer. The methodology for calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow takes into account the measured “actual or real” travel time and shortest (air) distance (path) between sites of dye insertion and dye appearance which means that it does not include the “actual or real” distance with multidimensionality and extremely nonlinear behavior of karst system. In contrast with this methodology, the calculation of mean translational velocity is based on “actual or real” data of measured travel time and distance required that dye appears on springs from the moment when the dye was inserted in the sinkhole, and the minor and major semi-axes of the boundary ellipse. This mathematically presented novel methodology takes into account information such as measured travel time and environmental characteristics (aquifer boundaries) which makes novel methodology innovative and sustainable. Since it would be good to know the velocity as close as possible to the “actual or real” groundwater flow velocity, the paper discusses the possibility of obtaining the mean translational velocity based on theoretical calculations and improving the existing calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow. Additionally, the value of this paper is a quantification of the relationships between the qualitative features of the karst system, i.e. makes them measurable contributing to SDG6.}

abstract = {This study proposes a pattern-free layout method for continuous generation and optimization of heliostat positions based on optical efficiency. Using annual weighted cosine efficiency as the objective function, the initial layout is generated through a continuous search from the optimal point of the entire field. This is followed by a secondary optimization and selection of all heliostats based on annual weighted optical efficiency. Points with efficiency above the threshold are retained, while low-efficiency points are discarded and re-entered into the search optimization until all eligible heliostat positions are identified, ultimately resulting in a highly efficient heliostat field. The efficiency improvement from the generative pattern-free layout optimization is primarily attributed to the initial search using annual weighted cosine efficiency, which enhances the annual weighted cosine efficiency of the field, and the secondary screening optimization, which improves shading and blocking efficiency. Compared to the original PS10 heliostat field, the annual weighted efficiency increased by 1.77%. Finally, two clustering-based pattern-free layout methods are proposed. The total distance from all points within a K-means cluster to the reference center is 58,238.1974 m, a reduction of 71.18% compared to the untreated original heliostat field. The method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model reduces the distance to the reference center by 66.90%. Classification based on optical efficiency reflects the overall distribution structure of the heliostat field’s optical efficiency, reducing the layout difficulty of pattern-free heliostat fields and providing feasibility for transforming theoretical research into practical engineering applications.}

abstract = {The polyvagal collection of hypotheses is based upon five essential premises, as stated by its author (Porges, 2011). Polyvagal conjectures rest on a primary assumption that brainstem ventral and dorsal vagal regions in mammals each have their own unique mediating effects upon control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses link these putative dorsal- vs. ventral-vagal differences to socioemotional behavior (e.g. defensive immobilization, and social affiliative behaviors, respectively), as well as to trends in the evolution of the vagus nerve (e.g. Porges, 2011 & 2021a). Additionally, it is essential to note that only one measurable phenomenon—as index of vagal processes—serves as the linchpin for virtually every premise. That phenomenon is respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart-rate changes coordinated to phase of respiration (i.e. inspiration vs. expiration), often employed as an index of vagally, or parasympathetically, mediated control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses assume that RSA is a mammalian phenomenon, since Porges (2011) states “RSA has not been observed in reptiles.” I will here briefly document how each of these basic premises have been shown to be either untenable or highly implausible based on the available scientific literature. I will also argue that the polyvagal reliance upon RSA as equivalent to general vagal tone or even cardiac vagal tone is conceptually a category mistake (Ryle, 1949), confusing an approximate index (i.e. RSA) of a phenomenon (some general vagal process) with the phenomenon, itself.}

However, novice learners, particularly in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, often face challenges in producing assessable language production. While student-generated questions (SGQ) offer a promising pedagogy, research on the comparative effects of different scaffolding types for SGQ in English grammar learning remains notably underexplored. This study investigated whether A2-level EFL learners benefit differentially from two distinct scaffold types, the less structured ‘main idea’ and the more structured ‘what-if-not’, on their grammar learning through SGQ. Adopting a quantitative, within-subjects quasi-experimental design, a convenience sample of 55 first-year non-English majors at a university in southern Taiwan participated. Data were collected via an online learning system (QuARKS) that delivered the scaffolded SGQ tasks, and student output was assessed using a multi-dimensional rubric measuring fluency, flexibility, and creativity (novelty and usefulness). Results from paired-sample t-tests indicated that the ‘main idea’ scaffold led to significantly higher fluency and novelty. Conversely, the ‘what-if-not’ scaffold resulted in significantly greater usefulness. No significant difference was observed for flexibility. The findings highlight the practical value of SGQ as a dual instructional and formative assessment tool in grammar learning, supported by technology. The multi-dimensional assessment approach provides nuanced insights into learner productive performance. This study suggests larger-scale, longer-term, and more diverse studies to evaluate sustained effects and generalizability across language proficiency levels.}

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive natural language processing abilities to generate sophisticated computer code for research tasks in various domains. We report the first study on the applicability of LLMs to perform computer experiments on microstructure pattern formation in model materials. In particular, we exploit LLM’s ability to generate code for solving various types of phase-field-based partial differential equations (PDEs) that integrate additional physics to model material microstructures. The results indicate that LLMs have a remarkable capacity to generate multi-physics code and can effectively deal with materials microstructure problems up to a certain complexity. However, for complex multi-physics coupled PDEs for which a detailed understanding of the problem is required, LLMs fail to perform the task efficiently, since much more detailed instructions with many iterations of the same query are required to generate the desired output. Nonetheless, at their current stage of development and potential future advancements, LLMs offer a promising outlook for accelerating materials education and research by supporting beginners and experts in their physics-based methodology. We hope this paper will spur further interest to leverage LLMs as a supporting tool in the integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach to materials modeling and design.}

abstract = {In sludge dewatering of most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the dose of polymer flocculant is manually adjusted through direct visual inspection of the flocs without the aid of any instruments. Although there is a demand for the development of automatic control of flocculant dosing, this has been challenging owing to the lack of a reliable flocculation sensor. To address this issue, this study developed a novel image sensor for measuring the degree of flocculation (DF) based on deep learning. Two types of sludge samples were used in the laboratory-scale flocculation tests: excess sludge and mixtures of excess sludge and raw wastewater. To search for a deep learning regression model suitable for DF inference, ten models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a multilayer perceptron MLP mixer, were comparatively analysed. The ConvNeXt and MLP mixer models showed the highest accuracies with coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.9. The region contributing to the DF inference in the flocculation images was visualised using a modulus-weighted, gradient-weighted regression activation map. A prototype of the flocculation sensor was constructed using an inexpensive EdgeAI device. This device comprises a single-board computer and an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU) and is equipped with a quantised ConvNeXt model. The maximum inference speed of the sensor was 12.8 frames per second (FPS). The flocculation control tests showed that the sensor could control the DF to the target value by adjusting the polymer flocculant dose. Therefore, the flocculation sensor can provide a data-driven approach to the management of the flocculation process, thereby facilitating the automation of WWTPs.}

This paper explores whether there are differences in the information behaviour of high school students when choosing a higher education institution (HEI) based on the educational attainment of their parents. We focus on the social factors of information behaviour in the post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Design/methodology/approach
We use Bourdieu’s social theory to demonstrate the need for a deeper inclusion of the social context for a more comprehensive understanding of information behaviour, and Bronfenbrenner’s theory of human development to propose a model for social interventions to reduce information inequality. Using the concept of cultural capital (CC), Bourdieu explains the reproduction of social inequalities through the educational system. We apply this concept to explain information behaviour when choosing an HEI as a partially socially conditioned behaviour. In a quantitative study, we investigate how the institutionalized form of parents’ CC is reflected in their children’s information behaviour in selecting an HEI.
Findings
There are two different patterns of information behaviour of high school seniors when choosing an HEI based on the institutionalized CC of their parents, especially fathers. The group of respondents whose fathers have a higher academic degree shows a different “taste” in using information sources and channels compared to the group whose fathers have a lower degree. These findings suggest that the lack of CC functions as an internalized structural barrier that shapes information behaviour on an unconscious level, and that social context operates on multiple levels.
Originality/value
This is one of the first papers that applies Bourdieu’s concept of CC and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to understand the social dimension of information behaviour.}

The interaction of five homonuclear diatomic gases, Cl2, F2, H2, N2 and O2, with several pure metals are examined using Coulomb's law to calculate the attractive and repulsive forces between the electrons or ions in the gas molecule and the free surface metallic electrons or ions assuming a Bohr model. These calculations demonstrate that the total energy of the electrostatic fields from the metals can exceed the molecular binding energies of Cl2, F2, and O2 at some distance from the metallic surface thereby suggesting that these gases interact primarily with the metallic surface in their atomic states after molecular bond dissociation prior to reaction. In contrast, H2 and N2 gases do not dissociate prior to reaching the metal surface due to the fact that the effective charge of the gas ions is less than the total electron charge at the outermost electronic shell. The present results correlate linearly with the electrochemical series standard reduction potential as well as with the Pauling electronegativity for several metals.}

Two elastically bent mirror (EBM) modules, each of which is composed of an elastically bent mirror and a loading mechanism, are integrated into a non-orthogonal two-axis Lloyd's mirror interferometer. The deflections of the X- and Y-EBMs can generate nonlinear components in the wavefronts of the X- and Y-beams, resulting in a stationary interference fringe field with variable pitches along the X- and Y-directions, respectively. The pitch specifications (the center pitch and the pitch variation range) of the grating can be adjusted by changing the corresponding module parameters (the tilt angle and the applied load). Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that for EMBs with a dimension of 450 mm (length) × 250 (width) × 2 mm (thickness), the center pitch can be linearly adjusted within the range of 680 nm–1290 nm with respect to a tilt angle range of 10°, while the pitch variation range is independently adjustable from 60 nm to 130 nm with respect to an applied load range of 8 N. Two-axis VLS grating structures with a center pitch of 1000 nm and a pitch variation of ±45 nm are successfully fabricated over a fabrication area of 100 mm × 100 mm, which demonstrates the feasibility of the developed system.}

To fill this gap, this study introduces a novel disinformation attack mode for road TCPS. It hacks navigation applications by strategically modifying the link cost information, thereby affecting drivers' routing decisions. Crucially, this attack mode leaves the physical topology of TCPS-based road networks unchanged, impacting only the cyber layer's information. Additionally, intriguing link metrics, like the partial derivative of total travel time to link flow, are introduced to identify attack targets. On this basis, we design multi-strategy disinformation attacks to assess road network vulnerability. The proposed research framework, validated by San Francisco's large-scale urban road network, reveals that disinformation attacks on just 0.12% of links could cause an annual city-wide economic loss of $79.26 million in the worst-case scenario. This study offers a unique viewpoint on road network vulnerability, emphasising the vital need for TCPS cybersecurity to ensure urban transportation's reliability and resilience.}

abstract = {Background
Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot’s impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders.
Methods
This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only.
Results
ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as “excellent” in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30).
Conclusions
ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.

abstract = {Technological advancements have always shaped labor markets; however, emerging AI innovations like ChatGPT are now putting occupations previously considered "safe" from technological substitution at significant risk of automation. This study examines individuals' willingness to pay to reduce automation risk, using a discrete-choice experiment conducted with nearly 6000 participants. Results reveal that respondents accept a salary reduction of almost 20 % of the Swiss median annual gross wage to reduce their automation risk by 10 percentage points or, conversely, demand a 20 % risk premium to accept an equivalent increase in automation risk. Interestingly, the study finds that WTP for risk reduction increases with higher baseline automation risk levels, contrary to patterns observed in other contexts. While preferences are generally homogeneous, differences exist between demographic groups. Men, younger and risk-tolerant individuals, and those with higher education show lower willingness to pay for reduced automation risk. By having respondents express preferences for hypothetical children, the study also explores potential gender biases, finding no significant differences in willingness to pay for reduced automation risk, educational degrees, hierarchical position, or wage based on the child's gender.}

EMT is crucial in embryonic development, tissue healing, and wound repair, and aids in forming diverse cell types and structures. However, aberrant EMT is involved in pathogenic processes, including fibrosis, cancer development, and progression. Recent studies show that EMT contributes to resistance to cancer treatment, including epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review discusses the intricate relationship between EMT and acquired chemoresistance to EGFR-TKIs. It details evidence on how EGFR-TKIs might induce EMT and how EMT may cause EGFR-TKI resistance. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing effective prognostic and therapeutic strategies to predict and combat acquired chemoresistance in NSCLC, advancing the field toward more targeted and personalized treatment approaches.}

This study explores how the use of Industry 4.0 technologies impacts the workplace well-being (WWB) of non-knowledge workers within manufacturing environments. In the context of the transition to Industry 5.0, where human well-being complements digital efficiency, the research aims to assess whether this impact exists and whether it is positive or negative.
Design/methodology/approach
Grounded in Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory and aligned with the principles of Industry 5.0, the study proposes and empirically tests a theoretical model. The model includes three antecedents, system quality (SQ), experience with technology (ET), and technology use (TU), and one dependent variable: WWB. Data were collected through a structured survey of 217 non-knowledge workers in the Italian manufacturing sector and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling.
Findings
The results confirm that Industry 4.0 technologies do have a significant impact on WWB. All three antecedents positively influence well-being, with SQ exerting the strongest effect, followed by ET and TU. These findings indicate that, contrary to concerns about alienation or loss of autonomy, the adoption of Industry 4.0 machines can enhance the quality of working life for non-knowledge workers.
Originality/value
This study is among the first to empirically investigate the impact of Industry 4.0 on the well-being of non-knowledge workers, a group often overlooked in digital transformation research. By addressing this theoretical gap, the study extends the application of STS theory and offers practical insights for fostering more inclusive, human-centric industrial environments in line with the vision of Industry 5.0.}

But at the same time, when students are limited to choosing from available online resources, their voices might be compromised due to the incompatibility between their authorial intentions and the materials available to them. This study, therefore, investigates whether the use of generative AI tools could help student authors construct a more consistent voice in multimodal writing. In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image-generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflections, written annotations, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices–layering and blending–through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students’ insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.}

Leveraging Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) and a comprehensive training dataset (490 k samples), the proposed approach enhances LLM customization while maintaining computational efficiency. Model quantization and mixed-precision training further optimize efficiency without compromising performance. Using this approach, the developed platform (EPlus-LLMv2) can auto-generate complex buildings with varying geometries, thermal zones, materials, hourly schedules, operation settings, etc. Tests on 402 modeling cases demonstrate 100 % accuracy of modeling while reducing modeling efforts by >98 %. Additionally, an interactive human-AI interface is developed to further enhance the platform's accessibility.

The use of Eleutherococcus trifoliatus L. S. Y. Hu (E. trifoliatus) in Yi ethnomedicine to treat rheumatic diseases can be traced back hundreds of years. However, its pharmacological mechanism and possible material basis remain unknown.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study is to explore the effective components and mechanisms of E. trifoliatus in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Materials and methods
Arthritic rats induced with FCA were treated with E. trifoliatus extracts (ETPE, ETEA, ETNBA) or methotrexate (MTX) for 30 days. The arthritis index, paw edema, organ indices, histopathology, serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, PGE2, NO), and synovial MMPs/NF-κB were assessed. The active ETPE fraction was separated, and the main compound, pimaradienoic acid (PA), was identified. PA's effects on MH7A cells were evaluated using CCK-8, Transwell, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blot.
Results
ETPE significantly reduced AI scores, paw swelling, thymic/splenic indices, synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration (p < 0.05 vs. model), and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, NO, p < 0.05 vs. model) while increasing IL-10 in FCA rats (p < 0.05 vs. model). It also downregulated synovial MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB (p < 0.05 vs. model). A high content and active ent-pimarane diterpenoid, pimaradienoic acid (PA), was isolated from ETPE. PA inhibited MH7A proliferation (IC50 = 69.13 ± 6.82 μM), migration, invasion, and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (p < 0.01). PA treatment reduced VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, IL-1β, and NF-κB secretion (p < 0.05), downregulated Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and IKKα protein expression, and upregulated Bax (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
ETPE is the main anti-RA fraction in E. trifoliatus, contains the active constituent PA, which alleviates RA by inhibiting synoviocyte proliferation, migration, and inflammation through NF-κB suppression and apoptosis promotion. This supports E. trifoliatus' traditional use and highlights PA as a promising anti-RA candidate.}

As its adoption gains momentum, understanding the potential risks associated with employee-GenAI collaboration becomes increasingly important. While much of the existing research emphasizes the challenges GenAI presents to employees as individuals, this study shifts the focus to explore broader organizational risks, particularly unethical workplace behaviors. Drawing on human-AI collaboration research and the job demands-resources model, we develop and empirically test a novel model to explain how and when employee-GenAI collaboration may lead to employees’ unethical behavioral outcomes in daily organizational contexts. Using an experience sampling approach with longitudinal data from 229 service industry employees, encompassing 1050 matched daily observations, our findings reveal that employee-GenAI collaboration increases work alienation—a sense of disconnection from work—which, in turn, drives employee expediency that compromises work standards. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is pronounced under high digital job demands. By highlighting this unintended consequence, our study contributes to theoretical advancements in understanding the darker side of employee-GenAI collaboration and provides practical insights to help organizations harness the benefits of GenAI while mitigating its potential ethical pitfalls.}

It plays a role in regulating melanin changes and rhythmic behaviors such as sleep and feeding, though its relationship with these processes is not fully understood. Our preliminary research revealed significant differences in melanin degradation in zebrafish under varying light conditions, suggesting a link to MCH. This study aims to explore MCH's role in lighting-induced changes in rhythmic behavior patterns and melanin of zebrafish. Using the zebrafish model, we evaluated MCH expression under different lighting conditions and analyzed the effects of arousal-promoting and sleep-inducing agents. We also investigated the impact of exogenous MCH and its inhibitors on melanin degradation, behavioral changes, and differences in MCH expression to uncover potential regulatory relationships between MCH, sleep pressure, and melanin. In-depth research using flow cytometry, acridine orange staining, LysoTracker Red staining, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of autophagy- and apoptosis-related genes showed that melanin degradation regulation depends on MCH expression levels. Sleep pressure can intervene in MCH's effects, forming a regulatory loop to jointly regulate melanin degradation. The influence of the MCH-sleep pressure loop on melanin degradation is closely tied to autophagic and lysosomal pathways. Our findings reveal a mutually regulatory loop in zebrafish between MCH and sleep pressure, affecting melanin degradation through these pathways.}

abstract = {Malignant melanoma, a highly lethal subtype of skin cancer, is categorized by the abnormal growth of melanocyte cells and is associated with elevated mortality rates. Improving the prognosis of patients with melanoma requires an early and precise diagnosis. Recently, deep learning models have emerged as dominant tools in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for the categorization of potential melanoma lesions. In clinical settings, obtaining high quality skin images can be challenging due to blurry, noisy, low-contrast images that may contain extraneous objects such as rulers or hair. To overcome these challenges, the Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) was utilized to detect and classify melanoma from dermoscopy images. The input images are collected from the 2020 Challenge Dataset of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The input images are provided to Information Exchange Multi-Bernoulli-Filter (IEMBF) based pre-processing for hair noise removal, resizing, random rotations, cropping, and splitting from input dataset. The pre-processed images are provided to Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) for detecting and classifying melanoma as benign and malignant. The Red Panda Optimization Algorithm (RPOA) is used to fine-tune STJGCN parameters. The proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN approach is implemented in Python and various performance metrics are analyzed to assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. The proposed approach attains the highest accuracy of 97.86% in melanoma detection and classification compared to various existing approaches. By demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN technique, this research contributes to faster and more accurate melanoma diagnosis, ultimately facilitating earlier intervention and treatment.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emphasizes the concept of medicine food homology (MFH), which integrates dietary therapy into health care. However, the practical application of MFH principles relies heavily on expert knowledge and manual interpretation, posing challenges for automating MFH-based dietary recommendations. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in health care decision support, their performance in specialized domains such as TCM is often hindered by hallucinations and a lack of domain knowledge. The integration of uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) with LLMs via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling a structured and faithful representation of MFH principles while enhancing LLMs’ ability to understand the inherent uncertainty and heterogeneity of TCM knowledge. Consequently, it holds potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of MFH-based dietary recommendations generated by LLMs.
Objective
This study aimed to introduce Yaoshi-RAG, a framework that leverages UKGs to enhance LLMs' capabilities in generating accurate and personalized MFH-based dietary recommendations.
Methods
The proposed framework began by constructing a comprehensive MFH knowledge graph (KG) through LLM-driven open information extraction, which extracted structured knowledge from multiple sources. To address the incompleteness and uncertainty within the MFH KG, UKG reasoning was used to measure the confidence of existing triples and to complete missing triples. When processing user queries, query entities were identified and linked to the MFH KG, enabling retrieval of relevant reasoning paths. These reasoning paths were then ranked based on triple confidence scores and entity importance. Finally, the most informative reasoning paths were encoded into prompts using prompt engineering, enabling the LLM to generate personalized dietary recommendations that aligned with both individual health needs and MFH principles. The effectiveness of Yaoshi-RAG was evaluated through both automated metrics and human evaluation.
Results
The constructed MFH KG comprised 24,984 entities, 22 relations, and 29,292 triples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Yaoshi-RAG in different evaluation metrics. Integrating the MFH KG significantly improved the performance of LLMs, yielding an average increase of 14.5% in Hits@1 and 8.7% in F1-score, respectively. Among the evaluated LLMs, DeepSeek-R1 achieved the best performance, with 84.2% in Hits@1 and 71.5% in F1-score, respectively. Human evaluation further validated these results, confirming that Yaoshi-RAG consistently outperformed baseline models across all assessed quality dimensions.
Conclusions
This study shows Yaoshi-RAG, a new framework that enhances LLMs’ capabilities in generating MFH-based dietary recommendations through the knowledge retrieved from a UKG. By constructing a comprehensive TCM knowledge representation, our framework effectively extracts and uses MFH principles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in synthesizing traditional wisdom with advanced language models, facilitating personalized dietary recommendations that address individual health conditions while providing evidence-based explanations.}

We utilize the long short-term memory network in large model methods and based on the idea of suitability model to conduct in-depth analysis of China's publicly available statistical data from 2000 to 2023. A comprehensive calculation and in-depth analysis of the ecological niche of open innovation ecosystem and basic ecological niche in 30 provincial-level administrative regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet) are carried out. The research results not only reveal the significant differences in the suitability of innovation ecological niche among different provincial-level administrative regions, but also show the complex relationship between ecological niche suitability and evolutionary momentum, as well as the different characteristics and development trends of each basic ecological niche. Compared to traditional measurement methods, the large model approach adopted in this study demonstrates significant advantages: (1) It is capable of processing massive and complex datasets, capturing the dynamic changes within innovation ecosystems; (2) By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, it effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNN models, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy; (3) In conjunction with fitness models, it provides a more comprehensive assessment of the internal mechanisms and external environmental factors of innovation ecosystems. This research provides important theoretical basis and empirical support for in-depth understanding of the innovation ecosystem in various provincial-level administrative regions of China, and helps to better grasp the pattern and direction of national innovation development and provide a powerful reference for formulating scientific and reasonable innovation policies.}

It assesses existing methods to mitigate biases and improve decision-making, introducing the novel “Impostor Bias”, which arises as a systematic tendency to question the authenticity of multimedia content, such as audio, images, and videos, often assuming they are generated by AI tools. This bias goes beyond evaluators' knowledge levels, as it can lead to erroneous judgments and false accusations, undermining the reliability and credibility of forensic evidence. Impostor Bias stems from an a priori assumption rather than an objective content assessment, and its impact is expected to grow with the increasing realism of AI-generated multimedia products. The paper discusses the potential causes and consequences of Impostor Bias, suggesting strategies for prevention and counteraction. By addressing these topics, this paper aims to provide valuable insights, enhance the objectivity and validity of forensic investigations, and offer recommendations for future research and practical applications to ensure the integrity and reliability of forensic practices.}

This study compared the functional response of plant communities on soil-bioengineered riverbanks with those on natural and hard-engineered (ripraps) riverbanks across 124 sites in Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that the Community Weighted Means (CWM) of 10 functional traits and three ecological attributes relevant in a riparian context and based on 356 plant taxa would be similar between bioengineered and natural sites, while functional diversity measured as richness (FRic) and dispersion (FDis) would be higher in bioengineered sites due to the diverse conditions (substrate, microhabitats). Contrary to expectations, we found trait-specific results. Compared to ripraps, natural sites were dominated by plants that were taller and had lighter seeds, as well as higher dispersion in specific leaf area, height, and seed mass, higher FRic, more dispersion of propagules by water and less by animals, and more plants with vegetative reproduction, shade tolerance, wetland-affinity, native, and fewer ruderal species. Bioengineered sites had intermediate mean trait values and dispersion, and only small differences among the three techniques applied (pure, keyed, and mixed) regarding the proportion of living and mineral material. Consistent with a previous study that used the same set of sites, we found higher plant cover, species richness, and diversity in natural sites compared to ripraps, with bioengineered sites falling in between the two. Bioengineering can partially reproduce natural riparian plant communities both taxonomically and functionally. Practitioners should consider functional diversity in their designs.}

One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modeled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.}

But measuring cities' visual uniqueness remains a challenge. Previous studies often focused on iconic landmarks, neglecting everyday scenes that people are likely to encounter. By examining how and to what extent different visual patterns build up unique characteristics of cities, we propose a data-driven framework to measure visual uniqueness in terms of identity and distinctiveness. We performed bottom-up visual clustering on Google Street View (GSV) images in the six most visited Japanese cities. We found that 8 representative visual clusters explain each city's visual identity and relative distinctiveness. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence applied to visual data can reveal subtle differences in urban environments. In the era of growing globalization, with frequent tourism and intercity visits, the cultivation of a city's unique visual characteristics can help avoid the homogenization of urban landscapes, and stimulate the development of urban tourism by shaping an imageable city.}

Specifically, in the field of adult education, there are limited studies on the effect of GenAI on teaching and learning. This study employs a cross-sectional quantitative design to examine the relationships between SDL, AL, and CT in the context of adult learners' use of GenAI tools like ChatGPT. It considers how demographic variables moderate these relationships. The study was underpinned by the SDL theory by Tough in 1971. An analysis of 281 survey responses of adult learners grouped by generation from five (5) adult higher education institutions in Ghana was performed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA (analysis of variance), and SEM (structural equation modeling). The study’s findings indicate that GenAI is perceived as having a significant positive effect on the SDL, AL, and CT of adult learners. A significant positive interrelationship was observed between SDL, AL, and CT. Demographic factors involving gender, year born (generational group), education level, and mode of learning had a perceived significant positive effect on SDL, AL, and CT. Notably, no statistical mean differences were found in the use of GenAI for SDL, AL, and CT across generational groups. The findings advocate for the effective adoption of GenAI to foster lifelong learning among adult learners. Developers of learning technologies and higher education leaders should ensure an inclusive GenAI design.}

Consequently, the results and findings derived from both phases were triangulated and the cohesive nature of the data was absolute.
Research limitations/implications
(i) Library schools include an elective module covering pedagogy and teaching with technology for librarians; (ii) library professional bodies create opportunities for academic librarians to develop pedagogy and digital skills; and (iii) higher education libraries need to create knowledge-sharing opportunities to improve the pedagogy and digital skills of academic librarians with teaching portfolios.
Practical implications
Higher education libraries and library schools must promote the teaching identity of academic librarians by helping them improve their pedagogical and digital skills for online teaching.
Social implications
This topic requires further exploration as academic librarians are fast becoming integrated into the teaching and learning agenda of institutions globally.

Although human-generative AI (GenAI) collaborative programming learning might have the potential to enhance personalized programming education, GenAI's interplay with SRL processes remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study first proposed a SRL Behavior Analysis Framework for human-GenAI collaborative programming learning environments and then examined SRL behaviors of a group of sixth-grade students (n = 36) in such an environment using this framework, along with various learning analytics methods including cluster analysis, descriptive statistics and lag sequential analysis. The analysis yielded the following results: (1) Based on their learning performance, primary school students were identified as three distinct clusters: programming specialized unit (PSU), high performance unit (HPU), and low performance unit (LPU). (2) Regarding SRL behaviors, students prioritized self-control (65.8 %), followed by self-observation (19 %), task analysis (12.1 %), and behavior stagnation (3.2 %). (3) Students in PSU and HPU consistently adopted goal-oriented SRL strategies, whereas students in LPU exhibited passive dependence and fragmented strategy use. GenAI's facilitative effect in supporting learning correlated with users' SRL capabilities. (4) Students in PSU and HPU exhibited frequent transitions between SRL behaviors, whereas students in LPU had insufficient ability to switch strategies when facing programming difficulties. Based on these findings, this study proposed four forward-looking design recommendations: effectively integrating GenAI with the programming environment, utilizing multimodal data and AI for learning assessment and feedback, building a cluster-driven early warning mechanism, and conducting dynamic SRL analysis and guidance based on fine-grained time-series data.}

Specifically, we propose a formal model of hybrid creative process designed to maximize the synergistic potential of the human-GenAI interaction. Drawing on machine learning literature, we conceptualize GenAI as a superposition of latent entities. Through formal argumentation, we demonstrate that optimal creative outcomes arise when human agents actively select the most appropriate entity from the complete spectrum of potential alternatives for the problem at hand. Finally, we outline the ideal iterative process required to asymptotically converge toward these optimal entities. Beyond its practical utility for managers, our model provides new insights into human-GenAI mutual augmentation, the nature of creativity, and the skills and cognitive properties involved.}

This study assessed the impact of three browsing intensities on argan trees in the Essaouira region: no-browsing, moderate-browsing (managed browsing or the Agdal system), and heavy-browsing systems. Measurements of argan physiological and biochemical traits and soil parameters revealed significant differences among the three-browsing intensities. Heavily browsed argan trees exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigments content, and leaf area index, while no-browsing system maintained optimal performances. The Agdal strategy significantly enhanced plant health compared to heavy browsing, improving physiological indicators and soil quality. Soil traits including electrical conductivity, moisture, and organic matter and total nitrogen content were notably better under managed browsing, promoting healthier argan ecosystems. Additionally, browsing intensity affected leaf biochemistry: overbrowsing induced a decline in protein content, while it enhanced total soluble sugars, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide content, and antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase), reflecting heightened stress responses. Overall, even if the non-browsed trees performed best, the moderate-browsing system (Agdal) may be the most suitable of the three browsing systems, since it will be able to meet goats’ feed needs while ensuring the sustainability of the argan forest ecosystem.}

The use of synthetic data is a widely discussed and promising solution for privacy-preserving medical research. Synthetic data may, however, not always rule out the risk of re-identifying characteristics of real patients and can vary greatly in terms of data fidelity and utility. We systematically evaluate the trade-offs between privacy, fidelity, and utility across five synthetic data models and three patient-level datasets. We evaluate fidelity based on statistical similarity to the real data, utility on three machine learning use cases, and privacy via membership inference, singling out, and attribute inference risks. Synthetic data without differential privacy (DP) maintained fidelity and utility without evident privacy breaches, whereas DP-enforced models significantly disrupted correlation structures. K-anonymity-based data sanitization of demographic features, while preserving fidelity, introduced notable privacy risks. Our findings emphasize the need to advance methods that effectively balance privacy, fidelity, and utility in synthetic patient data generation.}

While machine learning offers a promising solution, it often faces difficulties due to complex damage scenarios and imbalanced data, where safe samples vastly outnumber those requiring inspection or classified as dangerous. This imbalance limits the performance of machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a rapid seismic damage assessment method for bridge portfolios using a SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model. By utilizing bridge parameters and seismic data, this method eliminates the need for time-consuming on-site inspections, enabling quick and accurate predictions of bridge safety and traffic capacity. SMOTE is used to generate synthetic samples for all categories, with sampling ratios carefully adjusted to determine the optimal configuration that maximizes accuracy and improves data balance. The enhanced XGBoost model is then trained on the balanced dataset to classify bridge conditions, effectively mitigating the impact of class imbalance. The study also compares the performance of XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost on both original and SMOTE-balanced datasets. Results indicate that the SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model achieves a best accuracy of 83.3 %–87.5 %. This study integrates oversampling techniques with machine learning and proposes an automated modeling framework for imbalanced data. Its key innovation lies in the automatic determination of the optimal oversampling ratio, which is incorporated into the XGBoost training process to significantly improve classification performance and generalization ability, providing reliable support for emergency response and functional recovery.}

As a result of the rapidly changing external environment, diverse types of cooperatives have emerged. However, a comprehensive understanding of the organizational structures, including ownership, control, and benefit rights, of different types of cooperatives, is limited. This study analyzes the organizational structures of two types of cooperatives in China: entrepreneur-led cooperatives and government-led cooperatives. Qualitative methodology was used in this study, including semi-structured interviews with four green vegetable production cooperatives in Shandong province. Results reveal the structural differences between these two types of case cooperatives. Despite the shared ownership, control, and benefit rights among members, entrepreneur-led cooperatives are characterized by the dominance of core members in capital contribution, control rights, and dividend distribution; whereas government-led cooperatives distribute those rights more equally among all members. The findings in this study present a more comprehensive landscape of the organizational structures of China’s cooperatives. Empirically, it demonstrates how cooperatives can evolve and vary across laws and cultures, even within the same legislative background. Additionally, it offers crucial insights for these cooperatives to develop and sustain long-term vitality.}

It specifically examines young people’s engagement with and understanding of deepfakes, seeking to explore their practices for navigating deepfakes in a daily setting.
Design/methodology/approach
Employing a qualitative research strategy, in-depth interviews were conducted to collect empirical material from 20 young participants aged 14–15 years. The empirical data were coded both inductively and deductively, leading to the identification of young people’s doings and sayings as they encounter, respond to and understand deepfakes.
Findings
The findings highlight the young participants’ serendipitous exposure to, and subsequent engagement with, deepfake content in their everyday lives, particularly through the situations, platforms and types of content in which these encounters occurred. While interaction with deepfake content was mostly characterized as casual, there are also more active responses to encountering deepfakes. Additionally, the results shed light on the participants’ understandings of deepfakes, particularly in terms of content creation, societal impact and underlying AI techniques. This understanding is proposed as a critical sub-element within the MIL framework in this study.
Originality/value
This study stresses the complexities of young people’s everyday MIL practices with emerging media, pointing to the inherent challenges they face in navigating an increasingly complicated information landscape.}

abstract = {Background
Nowadays, the internet has become the primary source of information for physicians seeking answers to medical questions about their patients before consulting colleagues. However, many websites provide low-quality, unreliable information that lacks scientific validation. Therefore, physicians must develop strong information search skills to locate relevant, accurate, and evidence-based content. However, previous studies have shown that physicians often have poor search skills and struggle to find information on the web, which may have detrimental consequences for patient care.
Objective
This study aims to determine how medical students and residents searched for medical information on the internet, the quality of the web resources they used (including their nature and credibility), and how they evaluated the reliability of these resources and the answers they provided. Given the importance of domain knowledge (in this case, medicine) and information search skills in the search process, we compared the search behaviors of medical students and residents with those of computer science students. While medical students and residents possess greater medical-related knowledge, computer science students have stronger information search skills.
Methods
A total of 20 students participated in this study: 10 medical students and residents, and 10 computer science students. Data were extracted from a freely accessible data set in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. All participants searched for medical information online to make a diagnosis, select a treatment, and enhance their knowledge of a medical condition—3 primary activities they commonly perform. We analyzed search performance metrics, including search time, the use of medical-related keywords, and the accuracy of the information found, as well as the nature and credibility of web resources used by medical students and residents compared with computer science students.
Results
Medical students and residents provided more accurate answers than computer science students without requiring additional time. Their medical expertise also enabled them to better assess the reliability of resources and select high-quality web sources, primarily from hospital websites. However, it is noteworthy that they made limited use of evidence-based tools such as PubMed.
Conclusions
Although medical students and residents generally outperformed computer science students, they did not frequently use evidence-based tools. As previously observed, they may avoid databases due to the risk of encountering too many irrelevant articles and difficulties in applying appropriate filters to locate relevant information. Nevertheless, clinical and practical evidence-based medicine plays a crucial role in updating physicians’ knowledge, improving patient care, and enhancing physician-patient relationships. Therefore, information search skills should be an integral part of medical education and continuing professional development for physicians.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of hospital admission is an innovative tool that optimizes resource allocation and improves patient flow within emergency departments. Health institutions need to decongest these departments to maintain sustainability and become efficient. Increasing demand and excessive competition for limited resources directly contribute to these challenges.
Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence in the prediction of hospital admissions, evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, their impact on clinical decision- making, and their role in the optimization and allocation of resources.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published between 2019 and 2024 followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected based on a pre-defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, and methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (ChAMAI) tools.
Results
A total of 20 studies were included; most of the studies evaluated were retrospective. AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy (85 % to 95 %) compared to traditional methods, with Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks outperforming classical statistical models. Studies incorporating unstructured data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) have significantly improved patient flow and resource allocation. The integration of predictive analytics resulted in a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, optimized bed occupancy, and a decrease in emergency room overcrowding.
Conclusion
AI-driven admission prediction is promising in the hospital setting, as it improves efficiency and allows for proactive and rapid decision-making, optimizing available resources. Future research is promising and should focus on prospective studies to validate practical applicability.}

Existing research suggests that ligands for the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels may carry a risk of abuse. To evaluate the abuse potential of crisugabalin, five well-recognized animal models were utilized in these preclinical studies. Firstly, an intravenous self-administration paradigm was implemented in rats that were self-administering propofol to assess the reinforcing effects of crisugabalin. Secondly, a rat drug discrimination study was employed to determine the pharmacological similarity between crisugabalin and the training drug midazolam. Then, a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in rats was utilized to evaluate the rewarding properties of crisugabalin. After that, a spontaneous withdrawal study was conducted in rats chronically treated with crisugabalin to examine the liability of developing physical dependence. Finally, a mouse pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model was used following chronic exposure to crisugabalin to assess its potential for physical dependence. The results indicated that crisugabalin showed no positive reinforcing effects and did not display midazolam-like discriminative stimulus effects. Moreover, crisugabalin did not induce significant CPP in rats and there was no risk of physical dependence in the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model. In the rat spontaneous withdrawal study, crisugabalin demonstrated a very low level of physical dependence. These findings suggest that crisugabalin has minimal to no potential for abuse, thereby establishing itself as a safer option relative to pregabalin and mirogabalin.}

TouTiao (recommended news application with the largest number of registered users in China) was chosen as the research object and a total of 1014 valid questionnaires were collected. The results based on mediation and moderation tests show that algorithm appreciation plays a mediating role among the perceived news value, the perceived recommendation personalization, the perceived recommendation explainability and the continuance usage intention. Algorithm fatigue plays a mediating role among users' perceived information narrowing, perceived content low quality, perceived information overload and continuance usage intention. Privacy concerns negatively moderate the positive effect of algorithm appreciation on continuance usage intention, while positively moderating the negative effect of algorithm fatigue on continuance usage intention. To enhance users' continuance usage intention recommended news apps, it is necessary to pay attention to the two emotional elements of algorithm appreciation and algorithm fatigue, thereby improving user experience, and achieving a win-win situation between the platform and users.}

However, our understanding of the effect of lipid nanostructure on interactions of NCs with bacteria is lacking. Herein, we investigate the interactions of four different lipid NCs (including both cubosomes and hexosomes) with a simple bacterial supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the lipid bilayer of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combination of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF-M), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Addition of the fusogenic lipid di-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) increased interactions with the SLB, while addition of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) significantly increased interactions. The QCM-D data and SR-SAXS data indicate that mixing of the particles with E. coli mimicking model layers results in significant disruption to the cubosome structure, while hexosomes remain essentially structurally intact. We propose that the interaction mechanism with bacterial membranes differs among lipid NCs; while cubosomes primarily fuse with the lipid bilayer resulting in a loss of internal nanostructure, hexosomes interact with bacterial membranes via a different mechanism which allows them to retain structural integrity.}

Unfortunately, in the United States, a concerning 63% of fourth-grade children are reading below grade level, with approximately 7%–10% exhibiting a disability in word reading, developmental dyslexia. Research in developmental cognitive neuroscience indicates that individuals with dyslexia show functional and structural brain alterations in regions processing reading and reading-related information, with some of these differences emerging as early as preschool and even infancy. This suggests that some children start schooling with less optimal brain architecture for learning to read, emphasizing the need for preventative education practices. This article reviews educational policies impacting children with dyslexia and highlights a decentralized parent-led grassroots movement, Decoding Dyslexia, which centers the voices of those directly impacted by dyslexia. It utilizes civic engagement practices, advocacy and lobbying on local, federal, and social media platforms, and strong partnerships with scientists to drive systems-level change in educational practices, leading to dyslexia prevention legislation across the U.S. The ongoing partnership continues to address the profound gaps between scientific findings and policymaking to drive systems-level change for contemporary challenges in educational practices within a learning disabilities framework.}

After 28 days of oral treatment, behavioral tests (OFT, EPM, ART) were conducted. Tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, MDA), neuroinflammation (TNF-α), dopamine, AChE, gene expression (DMT1, Nrf2, Sod1), and histopathology. Mn induced locomotor deficits, anxiety-like behaviour, sensorimotor hyper-reactivity, oxidative stress (↓SOD/CAT, ↑MDA), elevated TNF-α, and reduced dopamine. EA co-treatment reversed behavioural impairments, restored antioxidant activity, normalized TNF-α/dopamine, EA suppressed Mn-induced Dmt1 upregulation, a key compensatory Mn uptake pathway in juveniles, while activating Nrf2, representing a novel dual protective mechanism. Histology confirmed EA preserved neuronal integrity and reduced hepatorenal damage. In conclusion, EA-associated downregulation of Dmt1 and downstream biochemical/histological improvements provide indirect evidence consistent with reduced Mn influx, but requires confirmation by direct brain Mn quantification.}

Dam-breaks are complete if the dam is totally and suddenly removed, or partial if the breach is smaller than the dam. While the behaviour of dam-break waves following the complete structural failure has been extensively studied, research on partial dam break scenarios remains limited. A special partial dam break scenario, consisting of a breach opening at the dam bottom, can be modelled in laboratory experiments with the sudden partial lifting of a sluice gate. Until now, the mathematical and numerical modelling of this partial dam break has received only partial scrutiny, and it is still unclear if the solutions predicted by existing models are those effectively observed in real-world scenarios or laboratory experiments. This study addresses these gaps by confronting the results of the analytical and numerical models proposed by Cozzolino et al. (2023) with recent laboratory experimental data from the literature. The comparison reveals that the inviscid exact solution to the partial dam break problem can reliably predict the type, number, and height of the moving waves developed under both free and submerged flow conditions. The agreement with experimental data is enhanced when applying the numerical model by Cozzolino et al. (2023), owing to the inclusion of dissipative effects through the frictional term. These results advocate extending the existing flow gate equations, usually found in steady flow conditions, to the case of strong transients. The findings further corroborate the application of the Shallow water Equations to the simulation of strong transients in open channels, even in the presence of flow-structure interactions such as those involving sluice gates, bridges, and flood control barrages.}

This systematic review aims to determine potential metabolic biomarkers and pathways linked to DRE, which could inform personalized treatment and optimize therapeutic outcomes. A comprehensive search of databases, namely Medline, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 29 eligible studies after full-text screening. The risk of bias from these studies was reviewed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. Key information, including study groups, sample size, model types, and main findings were tabulated. Several metabolites were identified, including amino acids (glycine, glutamate, isoleucine), organic acids (lactate), and glucose, which may serve as potential biomarkers for DRE. MetaboAnalyst 6.0 pathway analysis identified the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, as well as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways, emerged with significant impact score (≥0.5, p < 0.05).

Most existing approaches rely on mapping neural signals to pretrained models to generate latent variables, which are then used to reconstruct images via a diffusion model. However, this multi-step process can result in the loss of crucial semantic details, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel brain decoding framework, called Memory Recall (MR), inspired by bionic brain mechanisms. MR mimics the human visual perception process, where the brain retrieves stored visual experiences to compensate for incomplete visual cues. Initially, low- and high-level visual cues are extracted using spatial mapping techniques based on VAE and CLIP, replicating the brain’s ability to interpret degraded stimuli. A visual experience database is then created to retrieve complementary information that enriches these high-level representations, simulating the brain’s memory retrieval process. Finally, an Attentive Visual Signal Fusion Network (AVSFN) with a novel attention scoring mechanism integrates the retrieved information, enhancing the generative model’s performance and emulating the brain’s refinement of visual perception. Experimental results show that MR outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics and subjective assessments. Moreover, our results provide new evidence supporting a well-known psychological conclusion that the basic information capacity of short-term memory is four items, further demonstrating the informativeness and interpretability of our model.}

“Am I hungry? Did I overeat at lunch?” Gastric interoception - the sensing, interpretation, and regulation of signals from the gastrointestinal system - is central to daily behavior and homeostasis. Dysfunctional gastric interoception has been proposed as a maintenance factor in both eating disorders and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, no qualitative research has explored how individuals across these groups, and the general population, subjectively experience gastrointestinal signals, known as gastric interoceptive sensibility. This study aimed to investigate how gastric sensations are sensed, interpreted, and regulated among individuals with eating disorders, gastric disorders, and those without such diagnoses, focusing on identifying shared experiences. Methods: Fifteen semi-structured focus groups (n = 96) were conducted. Transcripts underwent hybrid deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Findings: Four key themes were identified. In “Sensations in the Interoceptive Body”, participants described hunger and fullness as physically aversive or reported an absence of cues related to satiation. “Perceiving the Interoceptive Body” captured the noticing, interpreting, attending to, and reacting to sensations of hunger, satiation, and fullness. In “Affective Experiences of the Interoceptive Body”, participants discussed how these sensations influenced emotional states positively, negatively, or not at all. “Responding to the Interoceptive Body” described participants strategies relating to relief-seeking, compensation, acceptance, distraction, and body checking in response to gastric sensations. Discussion: These findings shed light on the nuanced components of gastric interoceptive sensibility and suggest that individuals vary in how they experience and manage gastric signals. This work may inform interoceptive exposure therapies targeting maladaptive interpretations and regulation strategies in eating and gastrointestinal symptoms.}

Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system’s precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual’s trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.}

abstract = {Summary
Higher loading of active electrode materials is desired in batteries, especially those based on conversion reactions, for enhanced energy density and cost efficiency. However, increasing cathode loading in electrodes can cause performance depreciation, which can be alleviated by a compatible electrolyte design. In this work, a data-driven approach based on a graph-based deep learning model is adopted to screen high-performing electrolytes for a multi-electron redox-mediated Li-ICl battery and extract design rules custom to different cathode loadings. The model is trained with an experimental dataset of electrolyte formulations and battery capacity, with the inclusion of additional cell-level variables like cathode loadings. The approach brings about an additional 20% increment in the specific capacity of the battery over capacities obtained from the experimental optimization. The study resulted in an electrolyte with a high specific capacity of 250 mAh/g (at 1 mA/cm2) and excellent rate capability at the targeted 45 wt % cathode loading.}

Thus, it is important to provide them with the means and tools to understand the impact of their decisions on the energy consumption of software. To achieve this, more accurate information must be made available to better guide optimization efforts, in particular by identifying the specific sections of the software where the highest energy consumption occurs. This paper presents Pypen, a profiler that uses instrumentation to collect detailed execution data about the software execution. Through its integration with the ecosystem of tools of the technological component of the FEETINGS framework, Pypen is able to identify “hot” methods where the highest energy consumption occurs, allowing developers to focus on improving the energy efficiency of specific software sections. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, a sample study was conducted aimed at identifying areas of the software with higher energy consumption, providing opportunities to better focus improvement efforts.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art stable diffusion model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments. To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images. This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning workflows and public engagement.}

abstract = {Extensive applications have been found for rapid downscaling on meteorological wind field data in extreme weather warning, renewable energy assessment and site selection optimization, as well as dynamic simulation of nuclear accident emergency responses. This study proposes a progressive deep learning downscaling model (from 0.25° to 3 km) for generating high-resolution wind field data by integrating diffusion models with multi-head cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, a progressive diffusion framework is developed to generate high-resolution wind fields through iterative denoising of latent states initialized from Gaussian noise distributions. Compared to Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) architecture, our approach achieved approximately 32 % reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 46 % reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), while Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) was significantly improved from 0.7 to over 0.8. It is deduced that this approach significantly improves generation quality and alleviates non-physical artifacts caused by the mode collapse within Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The integration of multi-head cross-attention mechanisms and 2D Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) enables effective fusion of cross-modal information from low-resolution wind fields, terrain data, and diffusion model latent states. Ablation studies demonstrate that the attention mechanism reduced both MAE and MSE by approximately 20 %, while improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and SSIM values. This indicates that the attention mechanisms enable the model to capture long-range spatial dependencies, significantly enhancing its representational capacity and physical consistency in spatial feature reconstruction. Additionally, to address the slow reasoning speed of traditional diffusion models, this work implements the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling algorithm to achieve deterministic latent space mapping, substantially reducing inference steps while maintaining generation accuracy. This framework ultimately realizes rapid generation of high-precision wind field data within seconds. The proposed methodology provides a novel solution for meteorological wind field downscaling, directly serving various engineering applications requiring refined meteorological data.}

An advisor based on level k theory and implemented using ChatGPT is introduced in a four-stage beauty contest experiment. The experiment is designed to explore how AI advisors influence the depth of human reasoning by shaping beliefs, learning, and sophisticated backward induction. Extended cognitive hierarchy models (Camerer et al., 2004) are applied to identify heterogeneous level distribution and more sophisticated thinking. Additionally, the interactions between participants with and without AI advisors are examined. Two key results emerge. First, individuals overestimate AI capabilities when competing against AI-guided participants, which motivates them to employ higher levels of thinking. This observed higher-level behaviour is driven by more sophisticated backward reasoning. Second, improved reasoning under AI guidance shows heterogeneous effects across Cognitive Reflection Test scores, suggesting that AI's impact depends on participants' pre-existing cognitive abilities. Overall, this early research provides insights into the interaction between generative AI and human cognition and reasoning.}

abstract = {Introduction
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital modality for investigating brain related disorders. However, data scarcity especially for novel molecular targets like neuroepigenetic enzymes combined with difficult-to-recruit patient populations limits the development of machine learning (ML) models. Our primary objective is to enhance single-subject classification of neuromolecular imaging data and facilitate biomarker discovery. We demonstrate our approach using histone deacetylase (HDAC) PET/MR imaging in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).
Methods
We propose Catalysis Training pipeline, a framework that augments real imaging data with high-quality synthetic data generated by a Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN). Using [11C]Martinostat PET/MR imaging, we extracted 1-D standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) tabular features representing HDAC enzyme expression density across eight cingulate subregions. These were used to train and test ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Random Forest, under leave-one-out cross-validation.
Results
Integrating synthetic data in the training process improved classification accuracy significantly: +26% for XGBoost and Random Forest (from 59% to 85%), and +18% for SVM (from 70% to 88%). Synthetic samples improved model generalizability. Key hemispheric and subregional cingulate HDAC patterns were also identified as potential biomarkers.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that generative AI can help overcome data scarcity in low-data regime neuroimaging applications. Catalysis Training provides a scalable strategy to enhance ML-driven biomarker discovery and disease classification, especially for rare or difficult-to-study disorders like AUD. Clinically, cingulate HDAC expression measured by [11C]Martinostat PET/MR shows promise as an objective biomarker for AUD, complementing DSM-based diagnosis and informing novel treatment strategies.}

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

abstract = {Background
Patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) demonstrated a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its transition to acute kidney disease after diuretic therapy to reach euvolemic status. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether circulating levels of adropin predict AKI in ADHF patients after decongestive therapy.
Material and methods
A total of 325 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria of ADHF were consecutively enrolled from October 2020 to October 2024. The study was designed as prospective cohort study. The congestion was assessed using Framingham criteria of congestion (Framingham heart failure score ≥ 2). Patients with AHDF were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of AKI (n = 113) and without AKI (n = 212). Circulating levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-sensitive troponin T, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2, procalcitonin were measured. Predictors of AKI were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
We found that the presence of atrial fibrillation, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥16.5 mg/g Cr, serum levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL and NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL were independent predictors for AKI in patients with ADHF. UACR and atrial fibrillation revealed a strict similarity in prediction of AKI, whereas discriminative ability of adropin<2.1 ng/mL were higher to NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL. The combined predictive model (low levels of adropin + higher levels of NT-proBNP) showed significantly better discriminatory power compared to other models.
Conclusion
Low levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL on hospital admission in patients with ADHF can predict AKI and that its predictive ability was significantly higher compared with the conventionally used urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and NT-proBNP. Adropin may add predictive information to NT-proBNP for AKI in individuals with ADHF.}

abstract = {Background
Despite research linking chemical and physical restraints to negative outcomes including unplanned intubations and psychological distress, there is little guidance for their use in the care of trauma patients. We used institutional data to describe recent trends in chemical and physical restraint in the emergency department evaluation and treatment of trauma patients and to identify characteristics associated with their use.
Methods
This study includes adult trauma activations at a United States urban level I trauma center from January 2016 to July 2022. Data were collected from the trauma registry and medical record. We assessed the use of chemical restraints and physical restraints during care provided in the trauma resuscitation bay and emergency department. We assessed trends over time graphically and with logistic regression. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between restraint use and patient and clinical characteristics and the outcomes of ICU admission, hospitalization duration, and mortality.
Results
Of the 8,112 patients, most were male (74.8 %), White (55.8 %), and privately insured (35.2 %). Overall, 8.1 % were restrained with 7.1 % chemically restrained and 2.7 % physically restrained. Overall restraint use increased 254 % (p < 0.001) from 2016 to 2022 driven primarily by a 460 % (p < 0.001) increase in chemical restraint use including a 630 % increase in ketamine administrations (p < 0.001). Use of restraints was associated with pre-existing psychotic disorders, intoxication, altered mental status, increasing injury severity, and Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001). Chemical restraint administration was associated with a 3.5 percentage point (95 %CI 1.1–5.9; p = 0.004) increase in the probability of ICU admission and a 1.0 day (95 %CI 0.6–1.4; p < 0.001) increase in hospitalization duration.
Conclusions
In this institutional study, nearly one-in-twelve trauma patients were restrained during emergency department evaluation and treatment. Restraint utilization increased during the study driven primarily by increases in ketamine and restraints utilized during trauma bay evaluation and resuscitation. Future research should assess the generalizability of these findings. It is important that rigorous guidelines are established to ensure the safe and effective use of restraints in trauma.}

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity.}

With the advent of additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), the fabrication of complex lattice geometries with high precision has become feasible, which requires further investigation of their surface characteristics, microstructural behaviour, mechanical characteristics under different loading conditions, and biocompatibility. Therefore, this study was conducted to comprehensively analyze the surface integrity, mechanical responses, and biocompatibility of six distinct cellular architectures based on strut-based and sheet-based triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) topologies. The structures were designed using 3D Xpert software and manufactured using biomedical grade 316 L stainless steel (316 L SS) powder through the PBF-LB process. The dimensional analysis and surface roughness values indicated that the sheet-based structure demonstrated the closest alignment with its designed value. The XRD patterns and microstructural analysis have presented a marginal difference in the peak intensity and grain morphologies of the strut-based and sheet-based structures. Key mechanical properties, including compressive and tensile strength, high-cycle fatigue, and deformation behaviour, were systematically evaluated to compare the performance of these cellular designs. Relative density emerged as a crucial factor influencing the lattices' mechanical properties. In tensile testing, TPMS architectures outperformed strut-based counterparts in both strength and ductility. Among the strut-based lattices, the dodecahedron structure exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 83.92 MPa, while the split-p lattice from the TPMS category achieved a UTS of 307.34 MPa. The dodecahedron and split-p lattices also demonstrated exceptional resistance to both tensile and compressive loads, making them promising candidates for further study. Furthermore, the high-cycle fatigue tests revealed that the split-p lattice significantly outlasted the dodecahedron structure, enduring 317,010 cycles before failure at 0.2 σy and 48,730 cycles at 0.8 σy. Finally, the cell viability assessment showed that the dodecahedron lattice demonstrated the highest viability in the strut-based group, while the gyroid structure led among the sheet-based configurations. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanical performance of strut and TPMS cellular architectures, highlighting their potential for optimization in biomedical applications where strength, durability, and weight reduction are critical.}

The b* (yellowness, P = 0.039) and the a* (redness, P = 0.008) of the FSM were lower than those of the SBM. FSM group reduced muscle hardness (P = 0.004), gumminess (P = 0.009), chewiness (P = 0.007), and the diameter of muscle fibers (P < 0.05). A significant increase of total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.001), the content of α-linolenic acid (ALA, P = 0.003), homo-gamma-linolenic acid (P = 0.034), docosadienoic acid (P = 0.001), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, P = 0.003) was obtained in the FSM group. The CAT activity of FSM was significantly higher than that of SBM (P < 0.05).

Rare diseases (RDs) are conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people, with over 7,000 identified, primarily genetic in nature, and more than half impacting children. Although each RD affects a small population, collectively, between 3.5% and 5.9% of the global population, or 262.9–446.2 million people, live with an RD. Most RDs lack established treatment protocols, highlighting the need for proper care pathways addressing prognosis, diagnosis, and management. Advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to document the temporal progression of phenotypic features, addressing gaps in current knowledge bases. This study proposes an LLM-based framework to capture the natural history of diseases, specifically focusing on Noonan syndrome. The framework aims to document phenotypic trajectories, validate against RD knowledge bases, and integrate insights into care coordination using electronic health record (EHR) data from the Undiagnosed Diseases Program Singapore.}

Intrathecal 2,5-dihydro-7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3H-pyrazolo [4,3-c] quinoline-3-one (PZ-II-029, positive allosteric modulator of α6GABAA receptors) reduced tactile allodynia in female but not in male rats with neuropathic pain. PZ-II-029 was also more effective in females than males in inflammatory and nociplastic pain. Ovariectomy abated the antiallodynic effect of PZ-II-029 in neuropathic rats, whereas 17β-estradiol or 4,4′,4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT), estradiol receptor-α agonist, restored the effect of PZ-II-029 in ovariectomized rats. Blockade of estradiol receptor-α, using MPP (1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy) phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride), prevented the effect of 17β-estradiol on PZ-II-029-induced antiallodynia in ovariectomized neuropathic females. Nerve injury reduced α6GABAA receptor protein expression at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord of intact and ovariectomized female rats. In this last group, reconstitution with 17β-estradiol fully restored its expression in DRG and spinal cord. In male rats, nerve injury reduced α6GABAA receptor protein expression only at the spinal cord. Nerve injury enhanced estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG in intact non-ovariectomized rats. However, ovariectomy decreased estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG. In the spinal cord there were no changes in estradiol receptor-α protein expression. 17β-estradiol restored estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG and increased it at the spinal cord of neuropathic rats. These data suggest that 17β-estradiol modulates the expression and function of the α6GABAA receptor through its interaction with estradiol receptor-α in female rats.}

This study proposes a novel PCW-iTransformer model for predicting frost heave, which integrates PCHIP data interpolation, CEEMDAN signal decomposition, and WPT denoising to extract sequential features. Compared to existing models like Autoformer, Crossformer, and DLinear, PCW-iTransformer achieves a reduction of 19.1%–34.5% in error metrics and an improvement of 2.8%–4.6% in the coefficient of determination. Additionally, a fused parameter model based on normalized moisture and temperature improves prediction accuracy, reducing MSE, MAE, and RMSE by up to 7.6%. The model also demonstrates robustness under data scarcity, maintaining stable performance with 40% continuous or 60% random missing data. Overall, PCW-iTransformer provides a reliable approach for predicting frost heave, offering valuable insights for the maintaining and long-term stability of high-speed railway subgrades in cold regions.}

abstract = {Asphalt pavement experiences various wet-dry histories in the service stage. However, the influence of wet-dry history on asphalt mixture is unknown. Therefore, to clarify the performance degradation mechanism and predict the performance of asphalt mixture under the action of wet-dry history, the creep-recovery test, indirect tensile stiffness modulus test and indirect tensile strength test were conducted at different temperatures. The finite element method was adopted to analyze the moisture diffusing profile inside the specimen after wet-dry cycles. A moisture damage model considering the soaking time and repeated characteristics was developed to predict the damaged properties. Results show that wet-dry cycles cause a slight mass loss of asphalt mixture. Wet-dry cycling action leads to the increment in high-temperature deformation, and reductions in stiffness modulus and tensile strength. The increase of high-temperature deformation is primarily caused by viscoplastic component. Even if the soaking time is short, high moisture damage occurs while the wet-dry cycle is sufficient. Numerical simulations show that the moisture concentration profiles inside asphalt mixture vary under different wet-dry histories, leading to variations in the damage zone. The degree of damage is also closely related to the acting time of moisture. The critical immersion time of the dense asphalt mixture (about 43 hours) was determined in this study. When the immersion period is shorter than the critical immersion time, the strength loss is greater than the modulus. On the contrary, the degree of modulus damage is higher than that of strength. Considering the actual rainfall climate in China, the strength damage of the on-site asphalt mixture in the field predominates. The proposed model could reflect the weakening trends of modulus and strength. It has good universal applicability in predicting the damaged Marshall stability, modulus, and strength at different temperatures.}

This study compares direct laser machining (DLM) and waterjet-assisted laser micromachining (WJALM) in preparing LAR zirconia microchannels, focusing on surface morphology, heat-affected zones, microhardness, chemical and phase composition. Subsequently, parameter experiments of WJALM were carried out to achieve superior machined quality LAR zirconia microchannels by assessing the geometric profile and ablation-area-ratio. Experimental results indicated that WJALM significantly surpasses DLM, achieving a 46 % decrease in areal surface roughness (Sa), WJALM reduced the heat-affected zone depth by approximately 37 % compared to DLM. The WJALM process also enhanced the ablation-area-ratio by 61 %, achieving superior machining quality under optimized conditions of 27 W laser power, 100 mm/s scanning speed, and 8 m/s waterjet velocity.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a transcript of a dialogue among literacy educators and researchers on the impact of generative aritficial intelligence (AI) in the field. In the spring of 2023, a lively conversation emerged on the National Council of Research on Language and Literacy (NCRLL)’s listserv. Stephanie initiated the conversation by sharing an op-ed she wrote for Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the rise of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, moving beyond the general public’s concerns about student cheating and robot takeovers. NCRLL then convened a webinar of eight leading scholars in writing and literacies development, inspired by that listerv conversation and an organizational interest in promoting intergenerational collaboration among literacy scholars.
Design/methodology/approach
As former doctoral students of two of the panel participants, webinar facilitators Grace and Victoria positioned themselves primarily as learners about this topic and gathered questions from colleagues, P-16 practitioners and those outside the field of education to assess the concerns and wonderings that ChatGPT and generative AI have raised. The following webinar conversation was recorded on two different days due to scheduling conflicts. It has been merged and edited into one dialogue for coherence and convergence.
Findings
Panel participants raise a host of questions and issues that go beyond topics of ethics, morality and basic writing instruction. Furthermore, in dialogue with one another, they describe possibilities for meaningful pedagogy and critical literacy to ensure that generative AI is used for a socially just future for students. While the discussion addressed matters of pedagogy, definitions of literacy and the purpose of (literacy) education, other themes included a critique of capitalism; an interrogation of the systems of power and oppression involved in using generative AI; and the philosophical, ontological, ethical and practical life questions about being human.
Originality/value
This paper provides a glimpse into one of the first panel conversations about ChatGPT and generative AI in the field of literacy. Not only are the panel members respected scholars in the field, they are also former doctoral students and advisors of one another, thus positioning all involved as both learners and teachers of this new technology.}

Drawing upon the attitudinal ambivalence perspective (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of positive and negative evaluations of genAI use) and cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, our study proposes and tests an integrative research model to understand how users' attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI technology navigates their negative and positive emotional responses and shapes their post-adoption behaviors. We surveyed 530 genAI users and employed the structural equation modeling approach to test our research model. We find that attitudinal ambivalence is significantly associated with users' extended use and avoidance through the mediation of user trust and fear. Additionally, transparency significantly moderates the effects of attitudinal ambivalence on user trust and fear. Our study advances nature and consequences of attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI and provides insights for practitioners contemplating deploying genAI.}

In this study, government investment in education is treated as a transition variable and an alternative to educational expenditures. The results indicate a threshold of 7.44 % and a slope of 1.3. In the first regime, both the exchange rate and workforce negatively affect industrial value added. Conversely, in the second regime, the exchange rate and workforce have a positive impact on added value.

abstract = {This study aims to (1) investigate the transfer of experiential value between virtual and physical tourism contexts, (2) identify the internal and external factors influencing this transfer, and (3) develop an integrated theoretical framework to capture the dynamics of phygital tourism experiences. A systematic review of 116 peer-reviewed articles and a subsequent meta-analysis of 88 empirical studies (total sample: n = 28,545) identified key internal and external factors shaping user experiences through interactions across virtual and physical tourism spaces. Drawing on these findings, we propose the phygital tourism experience triad (PTET) framework, which conceptualizes experience formation as the alignment of cognitive and embodied actions, technological affordances, and spatial configurations spanning virtual spaces, physical tourism sites, and users' self-location (e.g., home). This research contributes valuable insights to guide future studies and informs the design and management of phygital tourism experiences.}

abstract = {Modern industrial production systems rely on a variety of sensors and sensor systems to capture qualified data, automate and control processes and to secure product quality. Sensors are the key elements to generate real world data and to feed trustworthy data into digital models or digital twins. A large variety of applications require a consistent digital metrology domain. It is a complex and challenging task, especially for modern internet of things (IOT) based factory environments with numerous sensors distributed. A stringent chain of traceable calibration information is essential when calibrating sensors and providing calibration data in a machine readable and machine interpretable way for a trusted digital quality infrastructure. The GEMIMEG-II project used and qualified the Digital Calibration Certificate (DCC) for industrial applications. It introduced quality indicators (QoX) with information on the trust level of the respective data. Finally, a DCC sub-model for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and Digital Product Passport (DPP) was prepared. A future perspective concludes this paper.}

We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SM-Seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and targeted qPCR to compare microbial and ARG diversity in the influent to a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Australia. ARGs were annotated with CARD-RGI and MEGARes databases, and bacterial diversity was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SM-Seq, with species annotation in SILVA/GreenGenes databases or Kraken2 and the NCBI nucleotide database respectively. CARD and MEGARes identified evenly distributed ARG profiles but MEGARes detected a richer array of ARGs (richness = 475 vs 320). Qualitatively, ARGs encoding for aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and multidrug resistance were the most abundant in all examined databases. RNA-seq detected only 32 % of ARGs identified by SM-Seq, but there was concordance in the qualitative identification of aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide, phenicol, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance by SM-Seq and RNA-seq. qPCR confirmed the detection of some ARGs, including OXA, VEB and EREB, that were identified by SM-Seq and RNA-seq in the influent. For bacteria, SM-Seq or 16S rRNA gene sequencing were equally effective in population profiling at phyla or class level. However, SM-Seq identified a significantly higher species richness (richness = 15,000 vs 3750). These results demonstrate that SM-Seq with gene annotation in CARD and MEGARes are equally sufficient for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in wastewater. For more precise ARG identification and quantification however, MEGARes presented a better resolution. The functionality of detected ARGs was not confirmed, but general agreement on the putative phenotypic resistance profile by antimicrobial class was observed between RNA-Seq and SM-Seq.}

abstract = {HIV-1 can rapidly infect the brain upon initial infection, establishing latent reservoirs that induce neuronal damage and/or death, resulting in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder. Though anti-HIV-1 antiretrovirals (ARVs) suppress viral load, the blood-brain barrier limits drug access to the brain, largely because of highly expressed efflux proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gp). While no FDA-approved P-gp inhibitor currently exists, HIV-1 protease inhibitors show promise as partial P-gp inhibitors, potentially enhancing drug delivery to the brain. Herein, we employed docking and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate key differences in P-gp’s interactions with several antiretrovirals, including protease inhibitors, with known inhibitory or substrate-like behaviors towards P-gp. Our results led us to hypothesize new mechanistic details of small-molecule efflux by and inhibition of P-gp, where the “Lower Pocket” in P-gp’s transmembrane domain serves as the primary initial site for small-molecule binding. Subsequently, this pocket merges with the more traditionally studied drug binding site—the “Upper Pocket”—thus funneling small-molecule drugs, such as ARVs, towards the Upper Pocket for efflux. Furthermore, our results reinforce the understanding that both binding energetics and changes in protein dynamics are crucial in discerning small molecules as non-substrates, substrates, or inhibitors of P-gp. Our findings indicate that interactions between P-gp and inhibitory ARVs induce bridging of transmembrane domain helices, impeding P-gp conformational changes and contributing to the inhibitory behavior of these ARVs. Overall, insights gained in this study could serve to guide the design of future P-gp-targeting therapeutics for a wide range of pathological conditions and diseases, including HIV-1.}

Some theorists defend a ‘late-onset’ view, suggesting that consciousness requires cognitive capacities which are unlikely to be in place before the child’s first birthday at the very earliest. Other theorists defend an ‘early-onset’ account, suggesting that consciousness is likely to be in place at birth (or shortly after) and may even arise during the third trimester. Progress in this field has been difficult, not just because of the challenges associated with procuring the relevant behavioral and neural data, but also because of uncertainty about how best to study consciousness in the absence of the capacity for verbal report or intentional behavior. This review examines both the empirical and methodological progress in this field, arguing that recent research points in favor of early-onset accounts of the emergence of consciousness.}

While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.}

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is important in medical diagnostics and cognitive neuroscience for brain activity recording and understanding, but limited data availability restricts the application of machine learning methods for classification and prediction purposes. Therefore, our ultimate aim is to synthesize physiologically accurate EEG data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this preliminary study, we first investigate how the choice of GAN hyperparameters influences the quality of simpler EEG-like generated signals. Thereto, we first created sinusoidal samples as target datasets with single (12 Hz), double (5, 12 Hz), or triple frequencies (5, 12, 28 Hz) and added Gaussian noise. We trained 2,592 models to generate fake sinusoidal samples and examined the effects of varying the hyperparameters batch size, learning rate of generator (LrG) and discriminator (LrD), and the number of epochs for vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). We compared the distributions of relevant target and fake signal features, such as amplitude, phase, and signal-to-noise ratio, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Our results showed that WGAN-GP models had better training stability for sinusoidal sample generation compared to WGAN, and significantly outperformed vanilla GAN. Smaller batch sizes accelerated convergence at a fixed number of epochs. Matching LrG and LrD balanced networks during training. Increasing the number of epochs (up to 100) enhanced performance. We conclude that the WGAN-GP model provides the best quality signals, when hyperparameters, particularly learning rate, are well tuned. We therefore propose that effective combinations of hyperparameters enhance training stability and performance of GANs for EEG signal generation.}

abstract = {The appropriate selection of dry hobbing control parameters can significantly improve cutting performances such as energy consumption and time. To overcome the problems of manually setting the value range of control parameters and numerical oscillation of the optimization results (i.e. low stability), a hybrid optimization approach is proposed for the improvement of hobbing performances under user evaluation using K-means clustering, multi-objective hunger games search (MOHGS) and TOPSIS. Firstly, K-means clustering is applied to obtain the cluster centers and case clusters based on the historical cutting cases. Considering the problem of control parameters to be optimized, the numerical range of control parameters is determined via the cluster centers and case clusters. Then, MOHGS is developed and applied to search the non-inferior control parameters and run for many times based on the multi-target optimization model of dry hobbing. Finally, all the non-inferior control parameters obtained are ranked by TOPSIS method based on the user evaluation of cutting performances, and the control parameter ranking first is for machining. Compared with other well-known approaches, it is proved that the proposed approach can effectively resolve the control parameter optimization problem of dry hobbing under user evaluation and has high stability.}

While the benzophenone molecule itself has been extensively studied towards the intrinsic mechanisms standing behind its prominent nature, yet its derivatives still tend to be under-explored in this particular regard. Coming across the disclosed imparity, throughout the present paper, a subject of rotational isomerism, anticipated to affect the BP frameworks substituted in the ortho position, is thoroughly investigated. In this respect, a bunch of ortho derivatives of BP are subjected to a systematic analysis carried out via both in silico DFT modeling and spectroscopic measurements (IR, UV–Vis). The obtained results show that the effect of rotamerism indeed applies to the studied group of compounds, as some of them reveal themselves in the form of multiple coexisting conformational isomers. What is more, as the indicated conformers are found to be characterized by substantially different emission profiles, the foregoing phenomenon is disclosed to have quite a remarkable impact onto the photoluminescence of the explored o-BP molecules.}

Intervention participants were given six weekly sessions on planning, monitoring, and reflection, while controls received normal instruction. t-test and PLS-SEM findings revealed that knowledge of tasks (MKT) and knowledge of person (MKP), and planning (MRP) and monitoring (MRM) significantly affected analytical thinking, explaining 73.5 % of its variance. Knowledge of strategies (MKS) and regulation/control (MRC), on the other hand, were not significant. The results underscore the significance of integrating planning and monitoring cues in coursework to improve students' higher-order thinking. One main limitation is the reliance on single-item scales for some of the constructs, and future studies should use longitudinal designs. The implications are useful for curriculum development in higher education.}
