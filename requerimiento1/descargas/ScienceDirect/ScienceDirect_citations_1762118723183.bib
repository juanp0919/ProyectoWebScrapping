abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, have the potential to substantially transform various domains, particularly platforms centered on information exchange. This study investigates the impact of generative AI on content contribution and knowledge-seeking behavior within online knowledge exchange platforms by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from a leading Q&A community. The results indicate a decrease in engagement levels, as evidenced by fewer posts and users, especially within the technology sector. However, this decline is accompanied by a notable benefit: an enhancement in the quality and complexity of questions, leading to an increased number of visits to these types of posts. Furthermore, our findings show a reduction in the number of questions and answers contributed by users with lower expertise, making communities more efficient. Our research highlights the importance of generative AI tools in the dynamics of knowledge exchange and offers suggestions for platform designers to revitalize their ecosystems to enhance user engagement.}

abstract = {This paper explores a significant shift in the field of mental health in general and psychotherapy in particular following generative artificial intelligence’s new capabilities in processing and generating humanlike language. Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is conceptualized as the “fourth narcissistic blow” that science inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch in therapy.}

As users increasingly rely on AI for image creation, understanding the factors that drive user value becomes essential. Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes a conceptual framework to examine the relationships among integration effort, compatibility, synergy, and value creation. Data from 531 AI image creators supported our hypotheses, revealing that: (1) integration effort significantly enhances both compatibility and synergy; (2) compatibility positively influences synergy; (3) synergy directly and positively impacts user value creation; and (4) synergy serves as a critical mediator in the relationships between the two enablers—compatibility and integration effort—and user value creation, with compatibility also partially mediating the link between integration effort and synergy. These results extend systems theory by integrating it more deeply with the resource-based view and highlighting synergy as a pivotal factor that not only directly drives user value creation but also mediates the effects of compatibility and integration effort. Furthermore, the study empirically confirms that user value can be conceptualized through three key constructs: efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.}

In orthopedic oncology, LLMs show promise in facilitating literature reviews, enhancing patient education, and supporting clinical decision-making by analyzing multidimensional data while providing improved logic-based reasoning. Additionally, they can assist in radiological and pathological workflows by interpreting imaging reports and drafting diagnostic summaries, thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy. In the near future, they are expected to aid in real-time patient follow-up and counseling, information transfer, efficient diagnostics, and even continuous surgical education and assistance. Despite their potential, challenges such as the risk of inaccuracies and biases, as well as the necessity for continuous supervision, warrant a cautious and responsible integration into clinical practice.

In this study, we demonstrate that ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)’, an artificial intelligence model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories akin to the vocabulary corpus of a language, we show that a GPT-based model can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables GPT to predict kinetically accurate sequences of states for a diverse set of biomolecules of varying complexity, at a much quicker pace than traditional MD simulations and with a better efficiency than other baseline time-series prediction approaches. More significantly, the approach is found to be equally adept at forecasting the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium active systems that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of the mechanism inherent in GPT reveals the crucial role of the ‘self-attention mechanism’ in capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight generative artificial intelligence's ability to generate kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.}

As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is creating new learning experiences, understanding the impact of five representative personality traits on students' self-regulated learning (SRL) while learning with GenAI tools can help to predict which personality traits indicate better self-regulation when learning with this innovative educational technology. Such a prediction can help educators to design effective learning activities by providing educational experiences that cater to students' different personality traits for specific learning objectives in the GenAI context. This study explored how variations in five representative personality traits affect students’ SRL performance when learning with ChatGPT. It used an explanatory approach based on structural equation modelling with a path analysis design. Four hundred and nine university students participated in the study and finished a self-reported questionnaire with validated items that are driven by previous studies. The results revealed that the personality traits of openness, extraversion, and agreeableness were significant predictors of all three stages of SRL; conscientiousness was a significant predictor of the forethought and self-reflection stages; and neuroticism failed to predict any of the three stages of SRL. These results may be attributable to the subjective nature of personality traits and the cognitive characteristics of SRL skills. The findings enrich the literature on SRL by introducing personality traits and GenAI as innovative perspectives and suggesting corresponding strategies for supporting different stages of SRL.}

abstract = {Background/purpose
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become widely used and applied in various fields. Although several studies have been conducted using generative AI for various qualification exams, to the best of our knowledge, none has focused on performance changes over time.
Materials and methods
In August 2025, ChatGPT 5, Gemini 2.5, Microsoft Copilot, and MediSearch were asked to answer compulsory questions from five years of the Japanese National Dental Examination. In 2024, we also conducted similar tests on other ChatGPT series and Gemini, and the scores were compared.
Results
In 2025, Copilot, Gemini, and MediSearch scored 80 % or higher, which was the passing standard, for all five years. Although ChatGPT 3.5 did not meet the passing standard for any of the five years, ChatGPT 4o mini and ChatGPT 5 exceeded it for two and three years, respectively. In addition, both Chat GPT's and Gemini's scores substantially improved over time and with each update.
Conclusion
This report suggests that generative AI is improving annually and adapting to the National Dental Examination. Although each AI model is suited to different fields, the trends may change over time. It is necessary to continue comparing and analyzing AI models and provide users with the latest information.}

In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content creation rather than to replace them through automation.

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.

Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.}

abstract = {The present pre-registered report explores the potential of AI-driven contact interventions by integrating generative Artificial Intelligence-based artificial humans into E-contact paradigms. Grounded in Allport's (1954) Contact Hypothesis and the Dual Identity Model (DIM; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), the study examines whether structured interactions with artificial humans can foster positive intergroup attitudes. Following the framework of E-contact interventions (White & Abu-Rayya, 2012), participants (N = 70 Caucasian university students) will engage in a within-between mixed-design experiment over three days. They will interact daily with an AI-powered 3D digital assistant representing either an outgroup member (Black avatar) or an ingroup member (White avatar) depending on the experimental condition, with pre- and post-intervention measures of intergroup attitudes. The structured interactions will follow the two-phase design of E-contact interventions, initially fostering personal acquaintance, then emphasizing group salience, and finally reinforcing a shared superordinate identity—a process aligned with the principles of DIM to maximize the generalization of positive intergroup attitudes. The virtual assistant will facilitate cooperative activities designed to enhance inclusivity, promote cultural exchange, and maintain subgroup distinctiveness while fostering a common identity. To ensure the effectiveness and coherence of the intervention, the scripted interactions will be pretested through a pilot study before implementation. This research offers a preliminary step toward understanding how artificial intelligence might contribute to enhancing E-contact interventions, potentially providing scalable and structured tools for fostering positive intergroup relations and supporting social integration.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, on higher education (HE). The ease with which content can be generated using GenAI has raised concerns across academia regarding its role in academic contexts, particularly regarding summative assessments. This research makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining university student and staff perceptions of current and future issues pertaining to the role of GenAI in universities.
Design/methodology/approach
A qualitative method involving five one-to-one semi-structured interviews with four students and a lecturer explored the ethical and practical issues of GenAI text generation in academia. An inductive thematic analysis was chosen as it provided nuanced insights aligned with the study’s goals.
Findings
Use of GenAI was discussed within the context of a range of topics, including perceptions of academic misconduct, authorial integrity and issues pertaining to university policies. Participants universally defined traditional classifications of academic misconduct but were unable to provide clear definitions where the use of GenAI was included for writing summative assessments. Students showed a more open engagement with GenAI, considering it a tool for overcoming obstacles rather than a means to plagiarise. Educators were generally more cautious and less optimistic about the academic role of GenAI. Lack of clear institutional policies surrounding such tools also contributed to ethical ambiguities.
Originality/value
The study highlights diverging perspectives between students and academics, which necessitate a forum for dialogue, ensuring the need to develop clear policies to steer the integration of GenAI in a manner that is beneficial for students and academics.}

abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven materials discovery offers rapid design of novel material compositions, yet synthesis and characterization lag behind. Characterization, in particular, remains bottlenecked by labor-intensive experiments using expert-operated instruments that typically rely on electromagnetic spectroscopy. We introduce SpectroGen, a generative AI model for transmodality spectral generation, designed to accelerate materials characterization. SpectroGen generates high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra with 99% correlation to ground truth and a root-mean-square error of 0.01 a.u. Its performance is driven by two key innovations: (1) a novel distribution-based physical prior and (2) a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. The prior simplifies complex structural inputs into interpretable Gaussian or Lorentzian distributions, while the VAE maps them into a physically grounded latent space for accurate spectral transformation. SpectroGen generalizes across spectral domains and promises rapid, accurate spectral predictions, potentially transforming high-throughput discovery in domains such as battery materials, catalysts, superconductors, and pharmaceuticals.}

abstract = {The construction industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing approximately $10 trillion and employing over 220 million workers worldwide, but encounters numerous productivity challenges with only 1 % annual growth compared to 2.8 % for the global economy. These challenges span various processes, including design, planning, procurement, inspection, and maintenance. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), capable of producing new and realistic data or content such as text, images, videos, or code from given inputs or existing knowledge, presents innovative solutions to these challenges. While there is an increasing interest in the applications of GenAI in construction, a detailed analysis of its practical uses, advantages, and areas ripe for development is still evolving. This study contributes to this emerging area by offering an insightful analysis of the current state of generative AI in construction. It has three objectives: (1) to identify and categorize the existing and emerging generative AI opportunities and challenges in the construction industry via a Delphi study; (2) to propose a framework enabling construction firms to build customized GenAI solutions; and (3) to illustrate this framework through a case study that employs GenAI model for querying contract documents. Through systematic review and expert consultation, the study identified 76 potential GenAI applications across construction phases and 18 key challenges distributed across domain-specific, technological, adoption, and ethical categories. The case study's findings show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the baseline large language model (LLM), GPT-4, by 5.2, 9.4, and 4.8 % in terms of quality, relevance, and reproducibility. The study recommends a structured approach to GenAI implementation, emphasizing the need for domain-specific customization, robust validation protocols, and careful consideration of ethical implications. This study equips academics and construction professionals with a comprehensive analysis and practical framework, facilitating the integration of GenAI techniques to enhance productivity, quality, safety, and sustainability across the construction industry.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in clinical pharmacy; yet, systematic evaluation of their efficacy, limitations, and risks across diverse practice scenarios remains limited.
Objective
This study aims to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of 8 mainstream generative AI systems across 4 core clinical pharmacy scenarios—medication consultation, medication education, prescription review, and case analysis with pharmaceutical care—using a multidimensional framework.
Methods
Forty-eight clinically validated questions were selected via stratified sampling from real-world sources (eg, hospital consultations, clinical case banks, and national pharmacist training databases). Three researchers simultaneously tested 8 different generative AI systems (ERNIE Bot, Doubao, Kimi, Qwen, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) using standardized prompts within a single day (February 20, 2025). A double-blind scoring design was used, with 6 experienced clinical pharmacists (≥5 years experience) evaluating the AI responses across 6 dimensions: accuracy, rigor, applicability, logical coherence, conciseness, and universality, scored 0‐10 per predefined criteria (eg, −3 for inaccuracy and −2 for incomplete rigor). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc testing and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for interrater reliability (2-way random model). Qualitative thematic analysis identified recurrent errors and limitations.
Results
DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek) achieved the highest overall performance (mean composite score: medication consultation 9.4, SD 1.0; case analysis 9.3, SD 1.0), significantly outperforming others in complex tasks (P<.05). Critical limitations were observed across models, including high-risk decision errors—75% omitted critical contraindications (eg, ethambutol in optic neuritis) and a lack of localization—90% erroneously recommended macrolides for drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (China’s high-resistance setting), while only DeepSeek-R1 aligned with updated American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for pediatric doxycycline. Complex reasoning deficits: only Claude-3.5-Sonnet detected a gender-diagnosis contradiction (prostatic hyperplasia in female); no model identified diazepam’s 7-day prescription limit. Interrater consistency was lowest for conciseness in case analysis (ICC=0.70), reflecting evaluator disagreement on complex outputs. ERNIE Bot (Baidu) consistently underperformed (case analysis: 6.8, SD 1.5; P<.001 vs DeepSeek-R1).
Conclusions
While generative AI shows promise as a pharmacist assistance tool, significant limitations—including high-risk errors (eg, contraindication omissions), inadequate localization, and complex reasoning gaps—preclude autonomous clinical decision-making. Performance stratification highlights DeepSeek-R1’s current advantage, but all systems require optimization in dynamic knowledge updating, complex scenario reasoning, and output interpretability. Future deployment must prioritize human oversight (human-AI co-review), ethical safeguards, and continuous evaluation frameworks.}

The study proposes that it isn't possible to harness the potential benefits of AI technologies unless students' concerns about these technologies are suitably addressed. Although the number of potential benefits specifically related to the use of AI in education is enormous, addressing students' concerns about AI is essential to ensure the effective use of these technologies in education. The correlational survey model was used in this study. Four well-established instruments were employed to collect data from students who studied in different public university faculties in Turkey. Participants were selected from students who had been using AI tools for educational purposes for at least six months. The findings showed that cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills impact on AI anxiety. Students with high cognitive flexibility had lower AI anxiety, while students with high digital competencies were better able to comprehend and use AI technologies. In addition, students with high self-regulation skills were able to manage their own learning processes more effectively and experienced less anxiety in using AI. As a result, increasing university students' digital competencies and self-regulation skills can be influential in reducing their AI anxiety. Accordingly, educational institutions could offer programs to develop students' digital competencies and AI literacy. These programs can help them adapt to AI technologies more easily and reduce their anxiety about these technologies by teaching students how to use AI technologies effectively and efficiently.}

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs. The validity and utility of the model will be established through future experimental efforts.}

A direct comparison of the capabilities of four common text-to-image generative AI algorithms is reported and recommendations for the most appropriate use, DALL-E 3, justified. The risks use and biases are outlined, and appropriate use guidelines framed for use of generative AI in nuclear medicine. Generative AI text-to-text and text-to-image generation includes inherent biases, particularly gender and ethnicity, that could misrepresent nuclear medicine. The assimilation of generative AI tools into medical education, image interpretation, patient education, health promotion and marketing in nuclear medicine risks propagating errors and amplification of biases. Mitigation strategies should reside inside appropriate use criteria and minimum standards for quality and professionalism for the application of generative AI in nuclear medicine.}

abstract = {Represented by ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is revolutionizing the field of education. Despite a series of related studies and reviews around GAI, existing reviews predominantly focus on macro-level discussions covering overall development trends, core issues, opportunities and risks. There has been a lack of systematic reviews from a meso-level perspective examining the application of GAI in classroom teaching within higher education. This study employs a systematic literature review method, examining 139 articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Findings include: (1)In terms of disciplines and types of GAI applications, engineering, health and medicine, and language are the most popular, while humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and interdisciplinary fields have fewer applications. Based on Strobel's classification of GAI(2024), it is found that Generators, Reimaginators, and Assistants are the most widely applied types of GAI. In contrast, Synthesizers and Enablers are less commonly utilized. Regarding the adoption trends across disciplines, engineering and language have a diverse range of GAI product types applied, whereas health and medicine has fewer types of GAI products in use. Due to smaller sample sizes, the analysis of GAI product types in the remaining six disciplines is also relatively limited. (2)In terms of the application of GAI across different disciplines, a small portion of GAI applications reflect distinctive disciplinary characteristics. Regarding the roles mapped out by the application of GAI, based on Xu and Ouyang's classification(2022), instructors or students predominantly perceive GAI as “New Subject” or “Direct Mediator", with less emphasis on the role of “Supplement Assistant”. Regarding the integration into the classroom, as assessed through the SAMR framework, most GAI applications are in the Augmentation level. There are also some in the Substitution and Modification levels, while applications in the Redefinition level are relatively rare. (3)In terms of the selection of instructional strategies under GAI applications, there are 18 types of strategies across four orientations, primarily emphasizing constructive and reflective orientations. Strategies focusing on didactic and authentic orientiations are less frequently utilized. Regarding the roles GAI plays as reflected in instructional strategies, it predominantly assumes roles as “New Subject” and “Direct Mediator", with the role of “Supplementary Assistant” yet to be explored. Finally, this study evaluated the instructional application research of GAI from three dimensions: GAI product type and applied discipline, discipline-specific application and integration level, instructional strategies and GAI role, and put forward relevant research suggestions.}

abstract = {Machine learning models are the backbone of smart grid optimization, but their effectiveness hinges on access to vast amounts of training data. However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them. The paper highlights the advantages of GenAI for smart grid communication, including reduced communication burden, enhanced privacy through anonymized data transmission, and improved efficiency and scalability. By enabling a distributed and intelligent communication architecture, GenAI introduces a novel way for a more secure, efficient, and sustainable energy future.}

The trend of using AI for co-creation will not spare artists’ creative processes, and it is important to understand how the use of generative AI at different stages of the creative process affects both the evaluation of the artist and the result of the human-machine collaboration (i.e., the visual artifact). In three experiments (N = 560), this research explores how the evaluation of artworks is transformed by the revelation that the artist collaborated with AI at different stages of the creative process. The results show that co-created art is less liked and recognized, especially when AI was used in the implementation stage. While co-created art is perceived as more novel, it lacks creative authenticity, which exerts a dominant influence. The results also show that artists’ perceptions suffer from the co-creation process, and that artists who co-create are less admired because they are perceived as less authentic. Two boundary conditions are identified. The negative effect can be mitigated by disclosing the level of artist involvement in co-creation with AI (e.g., by training the algorithm on a curated set of images vs. simply prompting an off-the-shelf AI image generator). In the context of art that is perceived as commercially motivated (e.g., stock images), the effect is also diminished. This research has important implications for the literature on human-AI-collaboration, research on authenticity, and the ongoing policy debate regarding the transparency of algorithmic presence.}

This study aimed to investigate the effect of GenAI on performance by examining a key affordance of GenAI—seeking help via question asking. We compared the questions that learners asked GenAI versus a human tutor online during a writing task. Using quantitative ethnographic methods, we found that: (a) participants in the GenAI condition asked significantly more questions compared to those in the Tutor condition; (b) GenAI participants tended to ask one-off questions, while Tutor participants tended to have longer conversational exchanges; (c) GenAI participants tended to question pragmatically, asking direct questions about conceptual and procedural knowledge, while Tutor participants tended to make indirect request for feedback; (d) question asking, as measured by epistemic network analysis, mediated the relationship between experimental condition and performance—the more pragmatic the questions, and thus the more like questions in the GenAI condition, the better the performance; and (e) questions in the GenAI condition were driven by social coordination and knowledge deficits, while questions in the Tutor condition were driven by social coordination and establishing common ground. These findings suggest learners may be less hesitant to admit knowledge deficits and more willing to repair them when interacting with GenAI compared to human tutors. Thus, GenAI can be a useful educational tool when improved performance is the goal and human tutoring may benefit from creating a space where learners are more comfortable revealing a lack of knowledge.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in scientific writing.
Methods
We conducted a review of the author and peer reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies.
Results
Our analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited.
Conclusion
Guidelines regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific integrity.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to explore employees’ perceptions and firsthand experiences of the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) productivity tools, specifically Microsoft 365 Copilot, on individual and collective learning processes within a multinational corporation. In doing so, the study provides insights into how these tools can shape workplace learning dynamics, fostering both individual skill development and collaborative knowledge-sharing practices.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors collected responses from 357 participants through a survey that included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. This study focuses exclusively on the qualitative responses. The reflexive thematic analysis method was used to capture and interpret employees’ perceptions of the role of Microsoft 365 Copilot – a generative AI-powered assistant integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite of applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) – in enhancing their work and learning opportunities in the workplace.
Findings
The results highlight four key themes contributing to workplace learning. At the individual level, Task Support illustrates the extent to which generative AI productivity tools transform work practices and facilitate both formal and informal learning pathways, while Meaningful Work underscores the tools’ role in enhancing employees’ foundational knowledge through enriched information. At the organisational level, organisational culture suggests the importance of fostering a supportive environment for AI integration, while organisational socialisation highlights its influence on team cohesion and the informal knowledge-sharing processes essential for effective collaboration within and among team members.
Practical implications
The results of this study offer actionable insights for organisations integrating generative AI productivity tools in the workplace. Understanding employees’ perceptions of the role of AI in workplace learning can inform the design of targeted training programmes that promote individual skill development and foster collaborative knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a supportive organisational culture that positions AI as a complementary resource can improve employee engagement, reduce resistance to new technologies and encourage a growth-oriented mindset, ultimately driving both personal and organisational development.
Originality/value
This study shifts the narrative around the role of AI in the workplace by examining how generative AI productivity tools can enhance workplace learning at both individual and organisational levels, rather than focusing solely on their potential to disrupt work through displacement and automation. By positioning AI-based applications as complementary to human work, this approach highlights their potential as enablers of skill development, knowledge sharing and job enrichment, fostering a more adaptive and learning-oriented work environment.}

There are numerous debates on how GenAI would fundamentally change existing business models. However, there is not much discussion on roles of generative AI in the domain of social good. Broader views covering potential opportunities of GenAI to enable diverse initiatives in the social good space are largely missing. We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good. We develop five propositions that will provide guidance to practitioners and researchers. The theoretically grounded analysis of 21 GenAI for social good use cases based on the two classification frameworks, and the resulting propositions are the original contributions of this paper to the AI for social good literature.}

However, a detailed understanding of the factors associated with pain in PD is still evolving. In this study, we examined the disability caused by pain and the pain experienced by PD patients using two validated questionnaires, namely the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) and the King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Questionnaire (KPPQ). Customized questions were also included to further explore the pain experience and management strategies adopted by PD patients. Through statistical analysis, we explored the relationships between questionnaire scores, socio-demographic data, and other relevant variables. Additionally, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) was employed to gain a deeper understanding of patient responses. The results indicate the extent and impact of pain in PD and provide valuable insights for more targeted and personalized management.

abstract = {Introduction
Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.
Methods
Twenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.
Results
Bard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT’s college level by all scoring metrics (P <0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P <0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85% ± 10) and ChatGPT (87% ± 14) (P=0.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P=0.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P=0.007)
Conclusion
Answers to questions about “labor epidurals” should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4th to 6th grade level suggested for patient materials. Consumers, health care providers, hospitals and governmental agencies should be aware of the quality of information generated by chatbots. Chatbots should meet the standards for readability and understandability of health-related questions, to aid public understanding and enhance shared decision-making.}

The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media’s constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today’s level of technological advancement. Further, it is far from reaching its full potential, as it is still incorporating advances in pattern recognition, planning and problem solving, and quantum computing technologies. This study also warns of concentrating the power of this game-changing technology in the hands of a few major corporate titans.}

abstract = {Background
General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.
Objective
This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.
Methods
We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.
Results
In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial.
Conclusions
This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively reshaping the way that researchers design and study highly complex systems. In this perspective, we introduce an engineering design methodology aimed at fostering creativity through “constructive dialogues with a generative AI” and exemplify its potential through a set of methodically developed case studies. This creativity promotion approach starts with computer-aided design (CAD) models of lattices, metamaterials, and architected materials, which are provided as initial inputs to a generative AI through a chat. Then, the conversation starts with researchers asking the generative AI to modify the provided CAD model images by incorporating new elements, placing them in quasi-real-life environments, or adapting the provided designs to the structures of new products. To illustrate the methodology, a varied set of selected case studies of constructive dialogues leading to highly innovative designs are provided, bridging the gap between tissue engineering scaffolds and building architectures, biohybrid materials and product design, and innovative structures and medical devices, to cite a few.}

Utilizing generative artificial intelligence, we have developed a framework to swiftly evaluate the γ' solvus temperature and tailor Ni-based superalloys, accelerating the process of discovering Ni-based superalloys. Physics-informed artificial neural network emerged as the optimal choice for reverse engineering, outperforming other models with an R2 score of 0.917 and a mean absolute error of 15 K. In the reverse design process, 20,000 virtual alloy samples were generated based on divide-and-conquer variational autoencoder which divides the dataset into distinct clusters by K-means algorithm provides a structured representation of the alloy composition space, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of its inherent complexities. In a specific alloy design example, 563 samples were identified through screening based on criteria like γ' solvus temperature, composition deviation index, price, and density. Thermodynamic calculations were used to further screen Ni-based superalloys with exceptional high-temperature properties. The showcase of BA alloy discovery through generative artificial intelligence demonstrates the potential of our research to steer the creation of novel compositions for Ni-based superalloys with outstanding high-temperature properties.}

While GAI has gained significant attention across various domains, its utility in breast cancer research has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This study aims to fill that gap by synthesizing existing research into a unified document. A comprehensive search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, resulting in the retrieval of 3827 articles, of which 31 were deemed eligible for analysis. The included studies were categorized based on key criteria, such as application types, geographical distribution, contributing organizations, leading journals, publishers, and temporal trends. Keyword co-occurrence mapping and subject profiling further highlighted the major research themes in this field. The findings reveal that GAI models have been applied to improve breast cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome predictions. Geographical and network analyses showed that most contributions come from a few leading institutions, with limited global collaboration. The review also identifies key challenges in implementing GAI in clinical practice, such as data availability, ethical concerns, and model validation. Despite these challenges, the study highlights GAI’s potential to enhance breast cancer research, particularly in generating synthetic data, improving diagnostic accuracy, and personalizing treatment approaches. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and stakeholders, providing insights into current research trends, major contributors, and collaborative networks in GAI-based breast cancer studies. By offering a holistic overview, it aims to support future research directions and encourage broader adoption of GAI technologies in healthcare. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of overcoming implementation barriers to fully realize GAI’s potential in transforming breast cancer management.}

It recommends that guidelines for using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in mental health care must be established promptly. Currently, clinicians using chatbots without appropriate approval risk undermining legal protections for patients. This could harm the patient and undermine the standards of the profession, undermining trust in an area where human involvement in decision-making is critical. To explore these concerns, this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act) is also considered. It will be seen that these laws are insufficient in the context of mental health. As such, the paper recommends that guidelines should be developed to help resolve the existing legal gaps until codified rules are established.}

Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: "GenAI as a work horse", "GenAI as a language assistant only", and "GenAI as a research accelerator". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed. The study underscores the need for adaptable, discipline-specific guidelines for GenAI use in research, developed collaboratively with experts to align with diverse research practices and minimize ethical and practical misalignment.}

abstract = {Objectives
This exploratory study aimed to develop a large language model (LLM)-based process to automate components of network meta-analysis (NMA), including model selection, analysis, output evaluation, and results interpretation. Automating these tasks with LLMs can enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability in health economics and outcomes research, while ensuring that analyses adhere to established guidelines required by health technology assessment agencies. Improvements in efficiency and scalability may potentially become relevant as the European Union Health Technology Assessment Regulation comes into force, given anticipated analysis requirements and timelines.
Methods
Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (V2), a process was designed to automate statistical model selection, NMA output evaluation, and results interpretation based on an “analysis-ready” data set. Validation was assessed by replicating examples from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technical Support Document (TSD2), replicating results of non-Decision Support Unit-published NMAs, and generating comprehensive outputs (eg, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and convergence).
Results
The automated LLM-based process produced accurate results. Compared with TSD2 examples, differences were minimal, within expectations (given differences in sampling frameworks used), and comparable to those observed between estimates produced by the R vignettes against TSD2. Similar consistency was noted for non-Decision Support Unit-published NMA examples. Additionally, the LLM process generated and interpreted comprehensive NMA outputs.
Conclusions
This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of LLMs to automate key components of NMAs, determining the requisite NMA framework based only on input data. Further exploring these capabilities could clarify their role in streamlining NMA workflows.}

abstract = {Background
Exercise cardiovascular magnetic resonance (Ex-CMR) can reveal pathophysiologies not evident at rest by quantifying biventricular volume and function during or immediately after exercise. However, achieving reproducible Ex-CMR measurements is challenging due to limited spatial and temporal resolution. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a free-breathing, high-spatiotemporal-resolution single-beat Ex-CMR cine enhanced by generative artificial intelligence. We assessed image analysis reproducibility, scan-rescan reproducibility, and impact of the reader's experience on the analysis.
Methods
Imaging was performed on a 3T CMR system using a free-breathing, highly accelerated, multi-slice, single-beat cine sequence (in-plane spatiotemporal resolution of 1.9 × 1.9 mm² and 37 ms, respectively). High acceleration was achieved by combining compressed sensing reconstruction with a resolution-enhancement generative adversarial inline neural network. Ex-CMR was performed using a supine ergometer positioned immediately outside the magnet bore. Single-beat cine images were acquired at rest and immediately post-exercise. In a prospective study, the protocol was evaluated in 141 subjects. A structured image analysis workflow was implemented. Four expert readers, with or without prior training in single-beat Ex-CMR, independently rated all images for diagnostic and image quality. The subjective assessment used two 3-point Likert scales. Biventricular parameters were calculated. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility were assessed. Fifteen healthy subjects were re-imaged 1 year later for scan-rescan reproducibility. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), with agreement evaluated via Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, and Pearson correlation.
Results
Free-breathing, single-beat Ex-CMR cine enabled imaging of the beating heart within 30 ± 6 s, with technically successful scans in 96% (136/141) of subjects. Post-exercise single-beat cine images were assessed as diagnostic in 98% (133/136), 96% (131/136), 82% (112/136), and 65% (89/136) of cases by four readers (ordered by descending years of Ex-CMR experience). Good image quality was reported in 74% (100/136) to 80% (109/136) of subjects. Biventricular parameters were successfully measured in all subjects, demonstrating good to excellent inter-observer reproducibility. Scan/rescan reproducibility over 1 year, assessed by two independent readers, showed excellent inter-visit ICCs (0.96–1.0) and strong correlations (R² ≥ 0.92, p < 0.001 for left ventricle; R² ≥ 0.95, p < 0.001 for right ventricle).
Conclusion
Single-beat Ex-CMR enabled evaluation of biventricular volumetric and functional indices with excellent reproducibility.}

abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.}

The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multi-modal generative AI to enhance human–computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation, image restoration, damage inspection, and human–computer interaction in structural health monitoring.}

To achieve the objectives of this work a covariance-based- structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was employed. The results indicate that relative advantage, top management support, organizational readiness, and customer pressures positively influence GEN-AI adoption. The empirical results demonstrated that the influence of compatibility and competitive pressures on GEN-AI adoption are insignificant.

Recently, there has been a surge in the development of this technology. However, existing deep learning-based design methods for shear wall structures suffer from poor quality and usability issues. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent design and optimization system for shear wall structures based on large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI). The system employs an LLM as the core controller, which interacts with engineers to interpret their language descriptions and translate them into executable computer code. Subsequently, the system utilizes the corresponding structural generation and optimization methods to accomplish intelligent design tasks automatically. Furthermore, the system incorporates such critical factors as the empirical rules, mechanical performance, and material consumption into the structural optimization process. A unique three-level, two-stage optimization method is constructed based on topology, pattern, and size to enhance the overall design quality. Being able to complete the entire workflow of architectural drawing processing, structural scheme generation, and analysis model establishment, the proposed system enables automated and efficient design of shear wall structures. Through the analysis and validation of multiple cases, it was demonstrated that this system can significantly speed up the design by approximately 30 times compared to that of traditional methods whilst ensuring the safety and cost-effectiveness of the design schemes. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights for the advancement of automated structural design undertakings.}

However, existing porous TPMS structural design methods are constrained to a forward process from structural parameters to mechanical properties. This study proposed an inverse design method that combines bidirectional generative adversarial networks (BiGAN) and mechanical performance targets, resulting in a combined TPMS structure of Primitive and IWP types with superior buffering and energy absorption capabilities. The results show that under a single load value target condition of the designed structure, the minimum deviation index (R2) between the load value corresponding to the displacement point and the target load value is only 0.987, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 5.92 %. When considering the elastic modulus target, the approach successfully conducts two sets of combined structural designs meeting the requirements of both high and low elastic moduli. When targeting the specified load-displacement curve conditions, specifically when combining high elastic modulus with ascending plasticity, the designed structures exhibit an error of only 2.2 % compared to the target property. Moreover, the quasi-static uniaxial compression experiments conducted on additively manufactured designed structures confirm that the experimental curves match the target curves in terms of deformation trends and load value ranges. The success of this inverse design approach for cellular TPMS structures has the potential to expedite new structural material development processes.}

This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2). To this end, the goal of this review article (as part 4 of our AI review series) is to provide an overview and a comparative measure of statistical measures and methodologies used in both generative AI and traditional (ie, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML fields along with their strengths and known limitations. By understanding their similarities and differences along with their respective applications, we will become better stewards of this transformative space, which ultimately enables us to better address our current and future needs and challenges in a more responsible and scientifically sound manner.}

abstract = {With the commercialization of ChatGPT, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied almost everywhere in our lives. However, even though generative AI has become a daily technology that anyone can use, most non-majors need to know the process and reason for the results because it can be misused due to lack of sufficient knowledge and misunderstanding. Therefore, this study investigated users’ preferences for when, what, and how generative AI should provide explanations about the process of generating and the reasoning behind the results, using conjoint method and mixed logit analysis. The results show that users are most sensitive to the timing of providing eXplainable AI (XAI), and that users want additional information only when they ask for explanations during the process of using generative AI. The results of this study will help shape the XAI design of future generative AI from a user perspective and improve usability.}

abstract = {Catalysis has made great contributions to the productivity of human society. Therefore, the pursuit of new catalysts and research on catalytic processes has never stopped. Continuous and in-depth catalysis research significantly increases the complexity of dynamic systems and multivariate optimization, thus posing higher challenges to research methodologies. Recently, the significant advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides new opportunities for catalysis research. Different from traditional discriminative AI, this state-of-the-art technique generates new samples based on existing data and accumulated knowledge, which endows it with attractive potential for catalysis research — a field featuring a vast exploration space, diverse data types and complex mapping relationships. Generative AI can greatly enhance both the efficiency and innovation capacity of catalysis research, subsequently fostering new scientific paradigms. This perspective covers the basic introduction, unique advantages of this powerful tool, and presents cases of generative AI implemented in various catalysis researches, including catalyst design and optimization, characterization technique enhancement and guidance for new research paradigms. These examples highlight its exceptional efficiency and general applicability. We further discuss the practical challenges in implementation and future development perspectives, ultimately aiming to promote better applications of generative AI in catalysis.}

However, studies on how to enhance immersive game-based learning with AI and VR technologies remain scant. Given this, the article presents the creation of “LearningverseVR,” an immersive game-based learning platform developed using generative AI and VR technologies, which is based on “Learningverse,” a metaverse platform developed by the lead author and her research team. The “LearningverseVR” platform uses Unity as the client and Python, Flask and MySQL as the backend. Unity's multiplayer service provides multiplayer online functionality, supporting learners to engage in immersive and interactive learning activities. The design framework of the platform consists of two main components: Game-based learning with generative AI and immersion with VR technologies. First, generative AI is used to create NPCs with diverse personalities and life backgrounds, and enable learners to interact with NPCs without scripted dialogues, creating an interactive and immersive game-based learning environment. Secondly, such a learning experience is enhanced by leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem with VR technology. The creation of the “LearningverseVR” platform provides novel perspectives on digital game-based learning.}

abstract = {Performance-based fire safety design requires thoroughly evaluating building fire scenarios to ensure comprehensive fire safety. However, conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fire simulations are computationally intensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of scenarios that can be practically analyzed. This study addresses these challenges by using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to predict fire scenes in realistic multi-room building layouts, characterized by complex shapes and intricate wall partitions. Three generative AI models for image generation are employed for this purpose: GAN-based pix2pix and pix2pixHD, as well as the diffusion model. These models were trained on an extensive dataset of CFD fire simulations to generate near-ceiling smoke movement and temperature distribution outcomes. When tested on new unseen building layouts, these models demonstrated remarkable accuracy and provided near real-time assessments. The diffusion model achieved the highest accuracy (>94 %) while requiring the more computational time. The high performance of these models highlights the potential of using generative AI to enhance fire safety engineering by enabling faster and more comprehensive fire risk assessments.}

abstract = {Background
The potential for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist with clinical tasks is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields.
Objective
This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about GenAI on primary care.
Methods
In January 2025, we conducted a web-based survey of 1005 UK GPs’ experiences and opinions of GenAI in clinical practice. This study involved a qualitative inductive descriptive analysis of a written response (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. After analysis, the interpretation of themes was also informed by the technology acceptance model.
Results
Out of 1005 respondents, 611 GPs (61%) provided written comments in response to the free text question, totaling 7990 words. Comments were classified into 3 major themes and 8 subthemes in relation to GenAI in clinical practice. The major themes were (1) unfamiliarity, (2) ambivalence and anxiety, and (3) role in clinical tasks. “Unfamiliarity” encompassed a lack of experience and knowledge, and the need for training on GenAI. “Ambivalence and anxiety” included mixed expectations among GPs in relation to these tools, beliefs about diminished human connection, and skepticism about AI accountability. Finally, commenting on the role of GenAI in clinical tasks, GPs believed it would help with documentation. However, respondents questioned AI’s clinical judgment and raised concerns about operational uncertainty concerning these tools. Female GPs were more likely to leave comments than male GPs, with 53% (324/611) of female GPs providing feedback compared to 41.1% (162/394) who did not. Chi-square tests confirmed this difference ((χ²₂= 14.6, P=.001). In addition, doctors who left comments were significantly more likely to have used GenAI in clinical practice compared with those who did not. Among all respondents, 71.7% (438/611) had not used GenAI. However, noncommenters were even less likely to have used it, with 80.7% (318/394) reporting no use. A chi-square test confirmed this difference (χ²₁=10.0, P=.002).
Conclusions
This study provides timely insights into UK GPs’ perspectives on the role, impact, and limitations of GenAI in primary care. However, the study has limitations. The qualitative data analyzed originates from a self-selected subset of respondents who chose to provide free-text comments, and these participants were more likely to have used GenAI tools in clinical practice. However, the substantial number of comments offers valuable insights into the diverse views held by GPs regarding GenAI. Furthermore, the majority of our respondents reported limited experience and training with these tools; however, many GPs perceived potential benefits of GenAI and ambient AI for documentation. Notably, 2 years after the widespread introduction of GenAI, GPs’ persistent lack of understanding and training remains a critical concern. More extensive qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.}
