abstract = {Background
Undergraduate medical studies represent a wide range of learning opportunities served in the form of various teaching-learning modalities for medical learners. A clinical scenario is frequently used as a modality, followed by multiple-choice and open-ended questions among other learning and teaching methods. As such, script concordance tests (SCTs) can be used to promote a higher level of clinical reasoning. Recent technological developments have made generative artificial intelligence (AI)–based systems such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) available to assist clinician-educators in creating instructional materials.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to explore how SCTs generated by ChatGPT compared to SCTs produced by clinical experts on 3 major elements: the scenario (stem), clinical questions, and expert opinion.
Methods
This mixed method study evaluated 3 ChatGPT-generated SCTs with 3 expert-created SCTs using a predefined framework. Clinician-educators as well as resident doctors in psychiatry involved in undergraduate medical education in Quebec, Canada, evaluated via a web-based survey the 6 SCTs on 3 criteria: the scenario, clinical questions, and expert opinion. They were also asked to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the SCTs.
Results
A total of 102 respondents assessed the SCTs. There were no significant distinctions between the 2 types of SCTs concerning the scenario (P=.84), clinical questions (P=.99), and expert opinion (P=.07), as interpretated by the respondents. Indeed, respondents struggled to differentiate between ChatGPT- and expert-generated SCTs. ChatGPT showcased promise in expediting SCT design, aligning well with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, albeit with a tendency toward caricatured scenarios and simplistic content.
Conclusions
This study is the first to concentrate on the design of SCTs supported by AI in a period where medicine is changing swiftly and where technologies generated from AI are expanding much faster. This study suggests that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in creating educational materials, and further validation is essential to ensure educational efficacy and accuracy.}

Mental health issues among healthcare workers remain a serious problem globally. Recent surveys continue to report high levels of depression, anxiety, burnout and other conditions amongst various occupational groups. Novel approaches are needed to support clinician well-being.
Objective
This integrative literature review aims to explore the current state of research examining the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and machine learning (ML) systems to predict mental health issues and identify associated risk factors amongst healthcare professionals.
Methods
A literature search of databases was conducted in Medline then adapted as necessary to Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and CINAHL with Full Text. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for the review.
Results
Nine studies employed various machine learning techniques to predict different mental health outcomes among healthcare workers. Models showed good predictive performance, with AUCs ranging from 0.82 to 0.904 for outcomes such as depression, anxiety and safety perceptions. Key risk factors identified included fatigue, stress, burnout, workload, sleep issues and lack of support. Two studies explored the potential of sensor-based technologies and GenAI analysis of physiological data. None of the included studies focused on the use of GenAI systems specifically for providing mental health support to healthcare workers.
Conclusion
Preliminary research demonstrates that AI/ML models can effectively predict mental health issues. However, more work is needed to evaluate the real-world integration and impact of these tools, including GenAI systems, in identifying clinician distress and supporting well-being over time. Further research should aim to explore how GenAI may be developed and applied to provide mental health support for healthcare workers.}

Thus, this study presents a document-based question-answering dataset derived from unstructured image documents across financial domains and investigates the impact of OCR-generated data on RAG outcomes. Although high OCR accuracy was achieved, especially for handwritten content, using raw OCR outputs directly in the RAG substantially increased the error rates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method of transforming OCR outputs into a structured tabular format, with the results showing a marked improvement in RAG performance without altering the OCR quality. The approach proved robust in correcting OCR errors, representing data in structured formats, and integrating alternative retriever and reranker techniques, and highlighted that RAG performance is more sensitive to the structure of input data than to OCR accuracy alone. This study presents a practical solution for optimizing RAG systems by utilizing structured representations of OCR-extracted data, thereby providing new insights for integrating OCR and RAG.}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across disciplines such as chemistry, mathematics, and medicine, yet their application in power system research remains limited, and most studies still focus on supporting specific tasks under human supervision. Here, we introduce Revive Power Systems (RePower), an autonomous LLM-driven research platform that uses a reflection-evolution strategy to independently conduct complex research in power systems. RePower assists researchers by controlling devices, acquiring data, designing methods, and evolving algorithms to address problems that are difficult to solve but easy to evaluate. Validated on three critical data-driven tasks in power systems—parameter prediction, power optimization, and state estimation—RePower outperformed traditional methods. Consistent performance improvements were observed across multiple tasks, with an average error reduction of 29.07%. For example, in the power optimization task, the error decreased from 0.00137 to 0.000825, a reduction of 39.78%. This framework facilitates autonomous discoveries, promoting innovation in power systems research.}

abstract = {Robot tool manipulation in industrial context requires precise spatial localization, stable force control, and versatile adaptability across diverse tools and tasks. Traditional robot manipulation methods usually struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios and maintain reliable, precise interactions under complex physical constraints. Recent Vision Language Model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate better generalization ability, but they often lack fine-grained modeling of spatial and force constraints that are critical for real-world industrial applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for zero-shot robot tool manipulation in industrial environments, named as ToolManip. This framework adopts a modular and multi-agent VLM architecture. It decomposes the manipulation process into four specialized modules—task understanding and planning, affordance reasoning, primitive reasoning, and execution monitoring—each handled by a dedicated VLM agent. To enhance the manipulation accuracy, we develop a multimodal affordance representation method that models spatial and force constraints separately. Spatial constraints are encoded via hierarchical region extraction and structured interaction fields to define keypoints and interaction directions, while force constraints are represented through force control primitive reasoning to enable precise and compliant motion and force planning. Additionally, an integrated execution-monitoring pipeline improves the system reliability by tracking the status of each task step and performing stepwise corrections. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolManip achieves robust, generalizable, and high-accuracy performance in various constraint-rich industrial tool manipulation tasks. Our work contributes to the development of advanced robotic manipulation methods for industry and smart manufacturing environments empowered by generative artificial intelligence.}

abstract = {Logistics 4.0, with its supporting technologies, is gaining popularity with researchers and practitioners as a way to navigate the dynamic and demanding logistics environment. Blockchain technology is such a topical technology in logistics. The logistics industry benefits from blockchain as it enhances communication and collaboration among stakeholders through applications such as information sharing, goods monitoring and tracing, and executing financing and payments. However, the perceived lack of clarity on the adoption benefits has increased decision-maker’s hesitation to adopt and utilize blockchain technology in the logistics industry. To fully understand blockchain applications in the context of logistics, this paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) on blockchain research in logistics. A selection of 113 articles undergoes review based on a two-axis framework. The first axis lists the core blockchain technologies, such as decentralized ledger, consensus mechanism, and smart contract. It comprehensively reviews their interplay with the foundational logistics requirements, such as agility, collaboration, and resilience. The second axis reviews domains such as e-commerce logistics, business logistics, green logistics, and logistics financing, which are key avenues for blockchain applications. The key themes arising from the review are a precursor to deriving avenues for future research. Finally, we present Web 4.0 in logistics, the new wave of generative artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered blockchain innovation that can shape future logistics. More specifically, we explore the role of modern AI agents in driving future research for seamless blockchain integration to logistics, enabling logistics ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and organizational adoption. Besides addressing a gap in existing literature, the concepts discussed in this study allow for a comprehensive understanding of blockchain adoption in logistics, thus encouraging wider practical application of novel technology. From a theoretical lens, this study helps comprehend blockchain technology and its significance to logistics research.}

abstract = {Background
The global surge in mental health challenges has placed unprecedented strain on health care systems, highlighting the need for scalable interventions to promote mental health self-care. Chatbots have emerged as promising tools by providing accessible, evidence-based support. While chatbots have shown promise in delivering mental health interventions, most studies have only focused on clinical populations and symptom reduction, leaving a critical gap in understanding their preventive potential for self-care and mental health literacy in the general population.
Objective
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a rule-based, topic-specific chatbot intervention in improving self-care efficacy, mental health literacy, self-care intention, self-care behaviors, and mental well-being immediately after 10 days and 1 month of its use.
Methods
A 2-arm, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 285 participants were randomly assigned to the chatbot intervention group (n=140) and a waitlist control group (n=145). The chatbot intervention consisted of 10 topic-specific sessions targeting stress management, emotion regulation, and value clarification, delivered over 10 days with a 7-day free-access period. Primary outcomes included self-care self-efficacy, behavioral intentions, self-care behaviors, and mental health literacy. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and mental well-being. Assessments were self-administered on the web at baseline, 10 days after the intervention, and at a 1-month follow-up. All outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models with an intention-to-treat approach, and effect sizes were calculated using Cohen d.
Results
Participants in the chatbot group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in behavioral intentions (F2,379.74=15.02; P<.001) and mental health literacy (F2,423.57=4.27; P=.02) compared to the control group. The chatbots were also able to bring significant improvement in self-care behaviors (Cohen d=0.36, 95% CI 0.08-0.30; P<.001), mindfulness (Cohen d=0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.38; P<.001), depressive symptoms (Cohen d=–0.26, 95% CI –1.77 to –0.26; P=.004), overall well-being (Cohen d=0.22, 95% CI 0.02-0.42; P=.02), and positive emotions (Cohen d=0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.54; P=.004) after 10 days. However, these improvements did not differ significantly at 1 month when compared to the waitlist control group. Adherence was higher among participants who received push notifications (t138=–4.91; P<.001).
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential of rule-based chatbots in promoting mental health literacy and fostering short-term self-care intentions. However, the lack of sustained effects points to the necessary improvements required in chatbot design, including greater personalization and interactive features to enhance self-efficacy and long-term mental health outcomes. Future research should explore hybrid approaches that combine rule-based and generative artificial intelligence systems to optimize intervention effectiveness.

However, adopting these algorithms in real-world scenarios is challenging, as images or textual descriptions are often unavailable. Moreover, in some cases, the provided images or descriptions may not accurately represent the item. We refer to such situations as missing data. In the fashion domain, visual information is crucial, as people are unlikely to buy clothing without seeing its design and appearance. Thus, we propose employing a text-to-image Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate missing visual data from available textual descriptions, enabling a multi-modal recommender system that leverages both visual and textual information. We also introduce an adaptive feature importance learning mechanism to dynamically determine the weight of each multi-modal feature when calculating the preference score. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through extensive experiments on the publicly available Amazon review dataset.}

Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research.}

Enhanced self-management is crucial for long-term survival following cardiothoracic surgery.
Objectives
This study aimed to develop a conversational agent to enhance patient self-management after cardiothoracic surgery.
Methodology
The solution was designed and implemented following the Design Science Research Methodology. A pilot study was conducted at the hospital to assess the feasibility, usability, and perceived effectiveness of the solution. Feedback was gathered to inform further interactions. Additionally, a focus group with clinicians was conducted to evaluate the acceptability of the solution, integrating insights from the pilot study.
Results
The conversational agent, implemented using a rule-based model, was successfully tested with patients in the cardiothoracic surgery unit (n = 4). Patients received one month of text messages reinforcing clinical team recommendations on a healthy diet and regular physical activity. The system received a high usability score, and two patients suggested adding a feature to answer user prompts for future improvements. The focus group feedback indicated that while the solution met the initial requirements, further testing with a larger patient cohort is necessary to establish personalized profiles. Moreover, clinicians recommended that future iterations prioritize enhanced personalization and interoperability with other hospital platforms. Additionally, while the use of artificial generative intelligence was seen as relevant for content personalization, clinicians expressed concerns regarding content safety, highlighting the necessity for rigorous testing.
Conclusions
This study marks a significant step towards enhancing post-cardiothoracic surgery care through conversational agents. The integration of a diversity of stakeholder knowledge enriches the solution, grants ownership and ensures its sustainability. Future research should focus on automating message generation and delivery based on patient data and environmental factors. While the integration of artificial generative intelligence holds promise for enhancing patient interaction, ensuring the safety of its content is essential.}

These findings provide valuable insights for future research and practice, aiming to support the application of generative AI in the context of language education.}

abstract = {Background
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to treatment. The lack of engagement with therapeutic materials and exercises between sessions, a necessary component of CBT, is a key determinant of unsuccessful treatment.
Objective
The objective of this study was to test whether the deployment of a generative artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled therapy support tool, which helps patients to engage with therapeutic materials and exercises in between sessions, leads to improved treatment success and patient treatment adherence compared with the standard delivery of CBT exercises through static workbooks.
Methods
We conducted a real-world observational study of 244 patients receiving group-based CBT in 5 of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service Talking Therapies services, comparing 150 (61.5%) patients who used the AI-enabled therapy support tool to 94 (38.5%) patients who used the standard delivery of CBT exercises. The groups were equivalent with respect to the content of the CBT materials and the human-led therapy sessions; however, the intervention group received support from the AI-enabled therapy support tool in conducting CBT exercises.
Results
Patients using the AI-enabled therapy support tool exhibited greater attendance at therapy sessions and fewer dropouts from treatment. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated higher reliable improvement, recovery, and reliable recovery rates when compared to the control group, which was related to the degree of use of the AI-enabled therapy support tool. Moreover, we found that engagement with AI-supported CBT interventions, relative to psychoeducational materials, predicted better treatment adherence and treatment success, highlighting the role of personalization in the intervention’s effectiveness. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects further, we conducted a separate qualitative experiment in a nonclinical sample of users (n=113). Results indicated that users perceived the AI-enabled therapy support tool as most useful for discussing their problems to gain awareness and clarity of their situation as well as learning how to apply coping skills and CBT techniques in their daily lives.
Conclusions
Our results show that an AI-enabled, personalized therapy support tool in combination with human-led group therapy is a promising avenue to improve the efficacy of and adherence to mental health care.}

keywords = {prompt engineering, generative artificial intelligence, kidney donation, transplant, living donor},
abstract = {Background
Living kidney donation (LKD), where individuals donate one kidney while alive, plays a critical role in increasing the number of kidneys available for those experiencing kidney failure. Previous studies show that many generous people are interested in becoming living donors; however, a huge gap exists between the number of patients on the waiting list and the number of living donors yearly.
Objective
To bridge this gap, we aimed to investigate how to identify potential living donors from discussions on public social media forums so that educational interventions could later be directed to them.
Methods
Using Reddit forums as an example, this study described the classification of Reddit content shared about LKD into three classes: (1) present (presently dealing with LKD personally), (2) past (dealt with LKD personally in the past), and (3) other (LKD general comments). An evaluation was conducted comparing a fine-tuned distilled version of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with inference using GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). To systematically evaluate ChatGPT’s sensitivity to distinguishing between the 3 prompt categories, we used a comprehensive prompt engineering strategy encompassing a full factorial analysis in 48 runs. A novel prompt engineering approach, dialogue until classification consensus, was introduced to simulate a deliberation between 2 domain experts until a consensus on classification was achieved.
Results
BERT and GPT-3.5 exhibited classification accuracies of approximately 75% and 78%, respectively. Recognizing the inherent ambiguity between classes, a post hoc analysis of incorrect predictions revealed sensible reasoning and acceptable errors in the predictive models. Considering these acceptable mismatched predictions, the accuracy improved to 89.3% for BERT and 90.7% for GPT-3.5.
Conclusions
Large language models, such as GPT-3.5, are highly capable of detecting and categorizing LKD-targeted content on social media forums. They are sensitive to instructions, and the introduced dialogue until classification consensus method exhibited superior performance over stand-alone reasoning, highlighting the merit in advancing prompt engineering methodologies. The models can produce appropriate contextual reasoning, even when final conclusions differ from their human counterparts.}

abstract = {Aim
The use of neural networks (NNs) is spreading to all areas of life, and Ecology is no exception. However, the data-hungry nature of NNs can leave out many small, valuable datasets. Here we show how to apply transfer learning to rescue small datasets that can be invaluable in understanding patterns of species co-occurrence.
Location
Semiarid plant communities in Spain and México.
Time period
2016–2022.
Major taxa studied
Angiosperms.
Methods
Based on a large sample of plant species co-occurrence in vegetation patches in a semi-arid area of eastern Spain, we fit a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that correctly reproduces which species live with which in these patches. Subsequently, we train the same type of model on two communities for which we only have smaller datasets (another semi-arid community in eastern Spain, and a tropical community in Mexico).
Results
When we transfer the knowledge learnt from the large dataset directly to the other two, the predictions improve for the community more similar to our reference one. As for the more dissimilar community, improving the accuracy of the transfer requires a further tuning of the model to the local data. In particular, the knowledge transferred relates primarily to species frequency and, to a lesser extent, to their phylogenetic relationships, which are known to be determinants of species interaction patterns.
Main conclusions
This AI-based approach can be performed for communities similar or not so similar to the reference community, opening the door to systematic transfer learning for accurate predictions on small datasets. Interestingly, this transfer operates by matching unrelated species between the origin and target datasets, implying that arbitrary datasets can then be transferred to, or even combined in order to augment each other, irrespective of the species involved, potentially allowing such models to be applied to a wide range of plant communities in different climates.}

Using a resource-based view model, this study investigates the relationship between generative AI use and employees' competitive advantage, as well as the moderating role of perceived organization support. From an analysis of data from 264 employees from 200 organizations, it is found that work-related generative AI use has a positive effect on employee boundary spanning, which contributes to employee competitive advantage. Secondly, work-related generative AI use also has a positive effect on employee agility, including employee resilience and employee adaptability, which further contributes to employee competitive advantage. However, work-related generative AI use has a positive effect on employee proactivity, while the effect of employee proactivity on employee competitive advantage is not significant. Thirdly, perceived organizational support can enhance the effect between employee boundary spanning and employee competitive advantage. However, it is interesting to observe that perceived organizational support enhances the effect between employee adaptability and employee competitive advantage, while weakening the effect between employee proactivity and employee competitive advantage. It does not exert a moderating effect between employee resilience and employee competitive advantage. These findings can help deepen the current understanding of the relationship between generative AI use in the organization and employee competitive advantage, and provide suggestions for business managers on how to use generative AI to improve employee competitive advantage.}

Binary and ordered logit regression models are estimated for the actual AI chatbot use. The results show that the older, the less educated and women lag behind in the use of this new technology. In addition, users who make greater use of other digital technologies are also more likely to use generative AI.

In recent years, mono-to-binaural (M2B) conversion has been explored in ADD to uncover forgery cues from a novel perspective. However, M2B-based methods may weaken or overlook unique forgery cues specific to mono, limiting detection performance. To this end, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Multi-Source Cues Fusion network for more accurate ADD (HMSCF-ADD). This approach leverages mono alongside binaural left and right channels as three distinct sources for hierarchical information fusion, it distinguishes common and binaural-specific features while removing redundant information for more effective detection. Specifically, binaural-specific and common features are first extracted and fused as binaural information, followed by dynamic fusion of mono and binaural information to achieve hierarchical fusion. Experiments on ASVspoof2019-LA and ASVspoof2021-PA datasets demonstrate that HMSCF-ADD outperforms all mono-input and M2B-based baselines. Detailed comparisons on fusion strategies and M2B conversion further validate the framework’s effectiveness. The codes are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/HMSCF-ADD.}

Antecedentes y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial generativa es una tecnología que ofrece su mayor conectividad con las personas gracias a los bots conversacionales («chatbot»). Estos pueden mantener un diálogo con un lenguaje natural indistinguible del humano y son una fuente potencial de información para los pacientes. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar el rendimiento de estos bots en la resolución de cuestiones específicas de cirugía ortopédica y traumatología empleando las preguntas del examen MIR español entre 2008 y 2023.
Material y métodos
Se analizaron 3 modelos de «chatbots» (ChatGPT, Bard y Perplexity) respondiendo a 114 preguntas del MIR. Se compararon aciertos, se valoró la legibilidad de las respuestas y se examinó su dependencia con el razonamiento lógico y la información interna y externa. En los fallos también se evaluó el tipo de error.
Resultados
ChatGPT obtuvo un 72,81% de aciertos, seguido por Perplexity (67,54%) y Bard (60,53%). Las respuestas más legibles y completas las ofrece Bard. Las respuestas demostraron un razonamiento lógico y el uso de información interna de los enunciados de preguntas. En 16 preguntas (14%) las 3 aplicaciones fallaron simultáneamente. Se identificaron errores, que incluían fallos lógicos y de información.
Conclusiones
Aunque los bots conversacionales pueden ser útiles en la resolución de preguntas médicas, se señala la necesidad de precaución debido a la posibilidad de errores. Actualmente deben considerarse como una herramienta en desarrollo y la opinión humana debe prevalecer sobre la inteligencia artificial generativa.
Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots («chatbots»). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients.The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.
Material and methods
Three «chatbot» models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.
Results
ChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%).Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all 3 applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.
Conclusions
While conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over Generative Artificial Intelligence.}

Despite their widespread availability, these models come with critical weaknesses, such as a lack of factual accuracy. Being informed about the advantages and disadvantages of these tools is essential for using AI safely and adequately, yet not everyone is aware of them. Therefore, we explored in three experimental studies how disclaimers affect people's perceptions of AI-authorship and AI-generated content on scientific topics. Additionally, we investigated the impact of information presentation and authorship attributions—whether content is authored solely by AI or co-authored with humans. Across the experiments, no effects of disclaimer type on text perceptions and only minor effects on authorship perceptions were found. In Study 1, an evaluative (vs. neutral) information presentation decreased credibility perceptions, while informing about AI's strengths vs. limitations did not. In addition, we found participants to believe in the machine heuristic, that is, to attribute more accuracy and less bias to AI than to human authors. Study 2 revealed interaction effects between authorship and disclaimer type, providing insights into possible balancing effects of human-AI co-authorship. In Study 3, both strengths and limitations disclaimers induced higher credibility ratings than basic disclaimers. This research suggests that disclaimers fail to univocally influence the perception of AI-generated output. Further interventions should be developed to raise awareness of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and to advocate for ethical practices in handling AI-generated content, especially regarding factual information.}

Despite their potential benefits in academic support, questions persist about the concrete advantages of integrating this technology into learning processes and its impact on academic outcomes. This research addresses this gap by investigating the influence of technology integration on academic performance, employing the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework and self-determination theory. The empirical findings from Chinese business students using Wenjuanxing platform reveal a positive impact of technology integration on business students' motivation, encompassing their learning desires, self-efficacy, and future beliefs, ultimately leading to enhanced academic performance. Notably, while epistemic curiosity augments the effects of technology integration on learning desires and future beliefs, its influence on self-efficacy is not significant. This suggests that curiosity alone might not be enough to alter deeply ingrained beliefs about one’s capabilities. In conclusion, this study underscores the academic significance of these findings and their practical implications for educators and business students in optimizing ChatGPT’s potential for academic success.}

These materials have potential application in important areas such as carbon capture, catalysis, gas storage, chemical separation, and drug delivery due to their modular, tunable structures, and their performance in these areas depends on precise control over their structure, chemical functionalities, and properties. Herein, we provide a review of generative AI algorithms that are emerging as powerful tools for the design of nanoporous materials, namely generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and large language models. Some models are particularly good at generating diverse and high-quality designs, while others excel at exploring large design spaces or optimizing materials with desired properties. Certain algorithms also allow for efficient transitions between different designs, and some offer versatility in generating materials based on textual input. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and applications of these algorithms in porous material design and emphasize the future potential of integrating AI with experimental workflows to accelerate the development and validation of AI-generated materials.}

abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.}

abstract = {Hypothesis / aims of study
Since its availability for public usage, ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (gAI) and large language model services have been tested for their ability and utilization in a number of medical diagnostic procedures and surgical education. Over time, ChatGPT’s ability to provide concise assessments and evaluations has improved so has its ability to learn and research true resources and references, while previous concerns about its shortcomings with regard to hallucinations and fallacy, among other issues, are easing. Urodynamic studies’ good practices and terminology have been described and published by the International Continence Society (ICS) and are recommended for practitioners 1, 3. We report on ChatGPTs ability to analyze urodynamic traces correctly before and after teaching it the ICS best practices and terms for urodynamics, cystometry and pressure-flow studies.
Study design, materials and methods
We chose at random urodynamic traces including cystometries and pressure-flow studies conducted at our institution by a single functional urology expert. The traces were then reassessed by another expert, and agreement in the assessments was noted. Any disagreement was resolved by a third expert. ChatGPT 4o was used, and it was asked to analyze the same traces twice: first batch without instruction to use certain resources or teaching, and the second batch after it was taught and instructed to use the ICS standards 1, 3. Parameters analyzed include components of the urodynamics traces as well as select nomograms, overall diagnosis and devising a management plan accordingly. Concordance with expert opinion before and after teaching ChatGPT was calculated and statistical significance of the teaching was calculated using McNemar’s test. Institutional board review approval was obtained.
Results
We analyzed a total of 100 urodynamic traces of different etiologies, of which 75% were of female patients. The most common presenting complaint was mixed urinary incontinence, while the most common diagnosis was non-neurogenic dry detrusor overactivity. With regards to assessments of filling cystometry results, ChatGPT did not exhibit any improvement or regression in its ability to correctly diagnose dysfunctions in sensation (p=1), cystometric capacity (p=0.1336), bladder compliance (p=0.4795), urinary incontinence (p=0.3711), and electromyography (EMG) synergy or dyssynergia (p=0.7728). The only parameter that reached some statistical significance was ChatGPTs ability to identify uninhibited detrusor contractions after teaching it (p=0.07). In a similar manner, ChatGPT’s ability to assess voided volume, detrusor pressure at maximal flow (Pdet@Qmax), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and identify after contractions remained unchanged after instruction and teaching (p>0.1), as well as its ability to calculate the bladder contractility index (p=0.25), provide an overall diagnosis (p=1) and formulate an appropriate management plan (p=0.13).
Interpretation of results
This study demonstrates that ChatGPT-4o has a consistent baseline ability to interpret urodynamic traces irrespective of formal instruction. Notably, its capacity to identify uninhibited detrusor contractions improved following exposure to ICS terminology and standards (p = 0.07), suggesting promise for refinement with targeted training.
Concluding message
Our findings underscore ChatGPT’s emerging utility in functional urology as a consistent, adaptable tool with the potential to support clinical education and decision-making. To enhance ChatGPT’s accuracy in interpreting urodynamic studies, future development should focus on multimodal fine-tuning using annotated trace-image datasets aligned with ICS standards, and gAI may eventually play a valuable role in standardizing and scaling access to urodynamic interpretation expertise.

The current study addresses this research gap by conducting and analyzing semi-structured, in-depth interviews with eleven high school teachers and sixteen high school students about their expectations for PAs' communication capabilities. The interviewees identified relational and task-related communication capabilities that a PA should perform to communicate effectively with students and scaffold their learning. PA communication that is simultaneously affirmative and relational can induce immediacy, foster the relationship and engagement with a PA, and support students' learning management. Additionally, the teachers and students described the activities and technological aspects that should be considered when designing conversational PAs. The study showed that teachers and students applied human-to-human communication scripts when outlining their desired PA communication characteristics. The study offers novel insights and recommendations to researchers and developers on the communicational, pedagogical, and technological aspects that must be considered when designing communicative PAs that scaffold students’ learning, and discusses the contributions on human–machine communication in education.}

abstract = {Background and objective
Generative artificial intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots (“chatbots”). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.
Material and methods
Three “chatbot” models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.
Results
ChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%). Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all three applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.
Conclusions
While conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over generative artificial intelligence.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo

Mental health is an essential element of life. However, existing mental health services face challenges in utilization due to issues such as societal prejudices and a shortage of counselors. Mobile health is gaining attention as an alternative approach to improving mental health by addressing the shortcomings of traditional services. As a result, various mental health apps are being developed, but there is a lack of evaluation research on whether these apps meet users’ needs.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the content and quality of mental health apps from the user’s perspective and identify the content features that influence evaluation scores. We also aim to guide future updates and improvements in mental health apps to deliver high-quality solutions to users.
Methods
We searched the Google Play Store and iOS App Store using Korean keywords “mental health,” “mental health care,” “depression,” and “stress.” Apps meeting the following criteria were selected for the study: relevance to the topic, written in Korean, more than 700 reviews (Android) or more than 200 reviews (iOS), updated within the past 365 days, available for free, nonduplicate, and currently operational. After identifying and defining the primary contents of the apps, 7 users evaluated their quality using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationships among app content, uMARS scores, star ratings, and the number of reviews. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors influencing uMARS scores and each evaluation item.
Results
The analysis included a total of 41 mental health apps. Content analysis revealed that reminders (n=29, 71%), recording and statistics features (n=29, 71%), and diaries (n=24, 59%) were the most common app components. The top-rated apps, as determined by uMARS evaluations, consistently provided information about counselors and counseling agencies, and included counseling services. uMARS scores were significantly correlated with the presence of health care provider information (r=0.53; P<.001) and counseling/question and answer services (r=0.55; P<.001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that providing more relevant information was associated with higher uMARS scores (β=.361; P=.02).
Conclusions
The quality of mental health apps was evaluated from the user’s perspective using a validated scale. To deliver a high-quality mental health app, it is essential to incorporate app technologies such as generative artificial intelligence during development and to continuously monitor app quality from the user’s perspective.}

Physicians are currently overwhelmed by administrative tasks and spend very little time in consultations with patients, which hampers health literacy, shared decision-making, and treatment adherence.
Objective
This study aims to examine whether digital agents constructed using fast-evolving generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to improve consultations, adherence to treatment, and health literacy. We interviewed patients and physicians to obtain their opinions about 3 digital agents—a silent digital expert, a communicative digital expert, and a digital companion (DC).
Methods
We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 patients and 22 physicians from a purposeful sample, with the patients having a wide age range and coming from different educational backgrounds and the physicians having different medical specialties. Transcripts of the interviews were deductively coded using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH) and then summarized according to code and interview before being clustered for interpretation.
Results
Statements from patients and physicians were categorized according to three consultation phases: (1) silent and communicative digital experts that are part of the consultation, (2) digital experts that hand over to a DC, and (3) DCs that support patients in the period between consultations. Overall, patients and physicians were open to these forms of digital support but had reservations about all 3 agents.
Conclusions
Ultimately, we derived 9 requirements for designing digital agents to support consultations, treatment adherence, and health literacy based on the literature and our qualitative findings.}

The final model demonstrated excellent fit indices, confirming its reliability and validity in assessing Generative AI competence across the five key factors. Research demonstrates that educational background considerably impacts AI competence, with individuals from technical disciplines showing a greater aptitude for problem-solving and content generation. Gender-based disparities were noted, with males achieving marginally higher scores in several factors, but with minimal effect sizes. Correlation analysis indicated that perceived AI expertise and frequency of AI utilization significantly influenced competence, especially in data literacy and problem-solving, and exhibited less correlation with ethical awareness. GenAIComp provides a reliable tool for assessing AI competence, helping educators, industry experts, and policymakers to design AI training programs and integrate AI literacy into curricula and thereby AI technology advancement in society. Future research should explore its applicability across cultures and include performance-based assessments to enhance AI competence.}

As more satellite imagery has become openly available, efforts in mapping the Earth’s surface have accelerated. Yet the accuracy of these maps is still limited by the lack of in situ data needed to train machine learning algorithms. Citizen science has proven to be a valuable approach for collecting in situ data through applications like Geo-Wiki and Picture Pile, but better approaches for optimizing volunteer time are still required. Although machine learning is being used in some citizen science projects, advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) are yet to be fully exploited. This paper discusses how generative AI could be harnessed for land cover/land use mapping by enhancing citizen science approaches with multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), including improvements to the spatial awareness of AI.}

Accurate prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial for safeguarding public health and the environment. However, AQI time series exhibit strong randomness and volatility, posing challenges for traditional forecasting methods to achieve precise AQI predictions. Therefore, we propose a new AQI hybrid prediction model, TG-Hybrid model, which integrates generative artificial intelligence, signal decomposition techniques, artificial intelligence methods, and optimization algorithms. In the proposed model, missing values in the data are handled using generative adversarial networks, effectively addressing the issue of a large number of missing values in time series data. Autoregressive integrated moving average is employed to forecast the linear components of the data, while variational mode decomposition decomposes AQI into multiple modes. Particle swarm optimization is used to combine the prediction results of convolutional neural network combined with bidirectional long short-term memory and extreme gradient boosting. Additionally, AQI prediction experiments were conducted using air pollution data from Tangshan and Beijing, and compared with fifteen other models. The results indicate that the root mean square error for Tangshan and Beijing are 6.407 and 7.485, respectively, significantly outperforming other baseline models.}

Teachers and students have been increasingly using chatbots in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in various ways, including for assessment purposes. However, there has been a lack of systematic investigation into LLMs’ capabilities and limitations in automatically generating items for STEM subject assessments, especially given that LLMs can hallucinate and may risk promoting misconceptions and hindering conceptual understanding. To address this, we systematically investigated LLMs' conceptual understanding and quality of working in generating question and answer pairs across various STEM subjects. We used prompt engineering on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with three different approaches: standard prompting, standard prompting with added chain-of-thought prompting using worked examples with steps, and the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language. The questions and answer pairs were generated at the pre-university level in the three STEM subjects of chemistry, physics, and mathematics and evaluated by subject-matter experts. We found that LLMs generated quality questions when using the chain-of-thought prompting for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and when using the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 overall. However, there were varying patterns in generating multistep answers, with differences in final answer and intermediate step accuracy. An interesting finding was that the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other approaches in generating correct final answers while demonstrating moderate accuracy in generating multistep answers correctly. In addition, through qualitative analysis, we identified domain-specific prompting patterns across the three STEM subjects. We then discussed how our findings aligned with, contradicted, and contributed to the current body of knowledge on automatic item generation research using LLMs, and the implications for teachers using LLMs to generate STEM assessment items.}

abstract = {Background
The use of mobile devices for delivering health-related services (mobile health [mHealth]) has rapidly increased, leading to a demand for summarizing the state of the art and practice through systematic reviews. However, the systematic review process is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools.
Methods
We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews.
Results
A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model.}

In A-Core, network capabilities can be added and updated on the fly and further programmed into missions for enabling and offering diverse services to customers.

The agents resolve intents from customers into workflows of network capabilities by leveraging a large-scale network AI model and follow the workflows to execute the mission.

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of network encryption protocols, analyzing encrypted traffic has become a significant challenge for network security. In this context, deep learning methods have been widely applied to intrusion detection and traffic classification tasks due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, these methods still face two main limitations: relying on unimodal feature extraction, which ignores the multimodal characteristics of network traffic, or adopting simple static fusion strategies, which may fail to capture the complex semantic associations between different modalities. These limitations make it challenging for models to detect sophisticated attacks concealed within otherwise normal encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an Entropy-Regulated Cross-Modal Generative Framework for Intrusion Detection (ER-CMGI), which combines the generative power of diffusion models with dynamic information-theoretic optimization techniques. The framework integrates variational autoencoders(VAEs) with a lightweight diffusion model for multimodal feature extraction and generation. It implements an adaptive fusion mechanism using a hybrid entropy-based approach that combines both traditional low-entropy priority and inverse entropy weighting through learnable mixing coefficients. The cross-modal generation consistency is achieved through a lightweight diffusion model, which enables self-supervised learning via direct cross-modal generation and comparison. This design enhances semantic alignment across heterogeneous modalities through cross-modal generative learning. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves F1 scores of 99.12% and 97.81% on two datasets, respectively. This study presents a dynamically adaptive and entropy-guided framework for intrusion detection in network environments, which shows effectiveness in capturing complex attack patterns. By integrating dynamic feature fusion with cross-modal semantic modeling, the framework enhances detection accuracy and interpretability, offering a promising approach for improving network security under evolving threat scenarios.}

It demonstrates the extent to which enjoyment, the most observable positive emotion in L2 learning, influences their involvement in AI-mediated IDLE (AI-IDLE) activities. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, this study surveyed 690 Chinese undergraduate students and conducted 12 post-survey interviews. Using a structural equation modeling approach, the quantitative analysis reveals that participants’ ideal L2 self can significantly predict both their sense of enjoyment and AI-IDLE, while the ought-to L2 self is only able to directly predict enjoyment. The quantitative results also demonstrate that enjoyment can partially mediate the relationship between the ideal L2 self and AI-IDLE and simultaneously fully channel the indirect impact of the ought-to L2 self on AI-IDLE. Supplementing these quantitative findings, the interview data provides a nuanced understanding of how motivation and enjoyment shift and interact with learning contexts as participants engage in AI-IDLE. Drawing on these quantitative and qualitative insights, this study identifies implications for pedagogy, particularly in terms of motivating Chinese university students to engage in IDLE while maintaining emotional well-being in the age of generative AI.}

This difference in performance suggests that ChatGPT could serve as a robotic advisor in transactional HR roles. In contrast, Bard may possess additional safeguards against misuse in the HR function, making it less capable of generating responses to certain types of questions. Statistical tests reveal that although the two systems differ in their mean accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the responses, the observed differences are not always statistically significant, implying that both tools may be more complementary than competitive. The Pearson correlation coefficients further support this by showing weak to non-existent relationships in performance metrics between the two tools.

abstract = {As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has recently gained popularity, society is undergoing a full-scale transformation centered around AI. This technology is attracting attention across various fields, particularly as it meets the growing demand for ‘24/7 availability’. Among these applications, AI chatbot-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems have demonstrated the ability to automate tasks, and with the integration of generative AI, they can now handle more advanced operations such as sending emails and managing complex workflows. However, because AI chatbot-based RPA systems are required to perform sensitive and high-level tasks, secure identity authentication is essential. Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication mechanisms pose risks, as they often require storing personal information within the AI chatbot system—potentially increasing the damage in the event of a security breach. To address this issue, this paper proposes an authentication mechanism that uses a Decentralized Identity (DID)-based one-time session key. By leveraging DID technology, the proposed mechanism ensures self-sovereignty and privacy. Furthermore, the use of a one-time session key guarantees session independence, non-reusability, and untraceability. A performance comparison with PKI-based mechanisms shows that when more than five authentications are performed, the proposed mechanism achieves higher time efficiency, highlighting its advantages in both security and effectiveness. Additionally, potential security threats in each step of the proposed system are analyzed probabilistically. A mathematical formula is presented to demonstrate that the likelihood of such threats occurring is very low. By performing partial differentiation on the attack success probability with respect to representative variables at each step, the analysis identifies which authentication process most significantly influences overall system security. This provides clear insights for designing secure authentication systems based on the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a new wave of AI around the world. However, the huge potential power demand from the widespread application of AI may challenge the carrying capacity of the power system. This paper uses the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) to study the impact of the explosive growth of AI on China's power demand and supply structure. The exponential growth of AI computing power will drive a rapid increase in China's power demand, and data centers are expected to become the third largest power-using sector in addition to the industry and residential sector. The explosive growth of AI will likely accelerate the growth of coal power generation, while slowing down the decline of the share of coal power, and further highlighting the attributes of coal power to maintain supply. Increasing the installed capacity of renewable energy can mitigate the negative impact of AI growth on the cleaner power supply transformation. The research results in this paper put forward targeted policy recommendations in terms of regulating power consumption in data centers, accelerating the growth of renewable energy installed capacity, and cautiously withdrawing from coal power in phases.}

abstract = {Background
Stroke has a major impact on global health, causing long-term disability and straining health care resources. Generative large language models (gLLMs) have emerged as promising tools to help address these challenges, but their applications and reported performance in stroke care require comprehensive mapping and synthesis.
Objective
The aim of this scoping review was to consolidate a fragmented evidence base and examine the current landscape, shortcomings, and future directions in the design, reporting, and evaluation of gLLM-based interventions in stroke care.
Methods
In this scoping review, which adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework, we searched 6 major scientific databases in December 2024 for gLLM-based interventions across the stroke care pathway, mapping their key characteristics and outcomes.
Results
A total of 25 studies met the predefined eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. Retrospective designs predominated (n=16, 64%). Key applications of gLLMs included clinical decision-making support (n=10, 40%), administrative assistance (n=9, 36%), direct patient interaction (n=5, 20%), and automated literature review (n=1, 4%). Implementations mainly used generative pretrained transformer models accessed through task-prompted chat interfaces. In total, 5 key challenges were identified from the included studies during the implementation of gLLM-based interventions: ensuring factual alignment, maintaining system robustness, enhancing interpretability, optimizing efficiency, and facilitating clinical adoption.
Conclusions
The application of gLLMs in stroke care, while promising, remains relatively new, with most interventions reflecting early-stage or relatively simple implementations. Against this backdrop, critical gaps in research and clinical translation persist. To support the development of clinically impactful and trustworthy applications, we propose an actionable framework that prioritizes real-world evidence, mandates transparent technical reporting, broadens evaluation beyond output accuracy, strengthens validation of advanced task adaptation strategies, and investigates mechanisms for safe and effective human-gLLM interaction.}

abstract = {Background
The rapid advancement of IT and the complexity of health care demand innovative nursing education that moves beyond lectures and workshops. Nursing students must acquire clinical knowledge alongside emotional intelligence (EI), empathic communication, and crisis management to respond to patients at risk for suicide. In Taiwan, suicide is the second leading cause of death among university students, underscoring the urgency of suicide prevention training. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms such as AI virtual humans provide immersive, scenario-based simulations that can integrate game-based learning into psychiatric nursing curricula.
Objective
This study evaluates the effectiveness of combining game-based pedagogy with AI virtual human simulations in enhancing nursing students’ EI, empathic communication, and psychological crisis management. Specifically, it aims to (1) foster self-awareness and emotion regulation, (2) strengthen crisis assessment and coping strategies, (3) increase motivation and engagement, and (4) establish an evidence-based framework for nursing education innovation.
Methods
An action research design will be conducted over 2 instructional cycles (36 weeks) within a psychiatric nursing course at a Taiwanese university. Participants are third-year postbaccalaureate nursing students recruited through convenience sampling. In phase 1, five simulation scenarios involving suicide risk presentations—major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and borderline personality disorder—were developed and validated by experts. Phase 2 applies 2 action research cycles (week 1 to 18 and week 19 to 36) with a single-group pretest-posttest design. Quantitative data include the Adult Emotional Intelligence Scale, administered at baseline and after the intervention. Qualitative data consist of reflection journals and classroom observations. Analysis employs descriptive statistics, paired sample 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, effect sizes, linear mixed-effects models, and thematic analysis.
Results
Scenario development and expert review were completed in phase 1. Cycle 1 (weeks 1-18) has begun from September 2025, with 37 students enrolled, exceeding the sample size target of 32. Postintervention Adult Emotional Intelligence Scale results will be collected by week 16, followed by cycle 2 with a new cohort. Final integration and analysis will occur after week 36 to evaluate intervention effectiveness.
Conclusions
Integrating game-based learning with AI virtual human simulations introduces an innovative, technology-enhanced model for psychiatric nursing education. Anticipated outcomes include improved EI, enhanced empathic communication, and stronger crisis management abilities. Through iterative refinement across 2 cycles, this study will provide empirical evidence on the role of generative AI in nursing education, informing curriculum innovation and supporting AI-driven simulation as a sustainable strategy for competency-based training.

Our paper examines the potential and challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to code student-generated content in online discussions based on intended learning outcomes and how instructors could use this to assess the intended and enacted learning design. If instructors were to rely on LLMs as a means of assessment, the reliability of these models to code the data accurately is crucial. Employing a diverse set of LLMs from the GPT family and prompting techniques on an asynchronous online discussion dataset from a blended-learning bachelor-level course, our research examines the reliability of AI-supported coding in educational research. Findings reveal that while AI-supported coding demonstrates efficiency, achieving substantial, moderate agreement with human coding for specific nuanced and context-dependent codes is challenging. Moreover, the high cost, token limits, and the advanced necessary skills needed to write API scripts might limit the usability of AI-driven coding. Finally, implementation would require specific parameterization techniques based on the class and may not be feasible for widespread implementation. Our study underscores the importance of transparency in AI coding methodologies and the need for a hybrid approach that integrates human judgement to ensure data accuracy and interpretability. In addition, it contributes to the knowledge base about the reliability of LLMs to code real, small datasets using complex codes that are common in the instructor's practice and explores the potential and challenges of using these models for assessment purposes.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown rapid advancements and increasing applications in various domains, including health care. Previous studies have evaluated AI performance on medical license examinations, primarily focusing on ChatGPT. However, the availability of new online chat-based large language models (OC-LLMs) and their potential utility in pharmacy licensing examinations remain underexplored. Considering that pharmacists require a broad range of expertise in physics, chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, verifying the knowledge base and problem-solving abilities of these new models in Japanese pharmacy examinations is necessary.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the performance of 18 OC-LLMs released in 2024 in the 107th Japanese National License Examination for Pharmacists (JNLEP). Specifically, the study compared their accuracy and identified areas of improvement relative to earlier models.
Methods
The 107th JNLEP, comprising 345 questions in Japanese, was used as a benchmark. Each OC-LLM was prompted by the original text-based questions, and images were uploaded where permitted. No additional prompt engineering or English translation was performed. For questions that included diagrams or chemical structures, the models incapable of image input were considered incorrect. The model outputs were compared with publicly available correct answers. The overall accuracy rates were calculated based on subject area (pharmacology and chemistry) and question type (text-only, diagram-based, calculation, and chemical structure). Fleiss’ κ was used to measure answer consistency among the top-performing models.
Results
Four flagship models—ChatGPT o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new), and Perplexity Pro—achieved 80% accuracy, surpassing the official passing threshold and average examinee score. A significant improvement in the overall accuracy was observed between the early and the latest 2024 models. Marked improvements were noted in text-only and diagram-based questions compared with those of earlier versions. However, the accuracy of chemistry-related and chemical structure questions remains relatively low. Fleiss’ κ among the 4 flagship models was 0.334, which suggests moderate consistency but highlights variability in more complex questions.
Conclusions
OC-LLMs have substantially improved their capacity to handle Japanese pharmacists’ examination content, with several newer models achieving accuracy rates of >80%. Despite these advancements, even the best-performing models exhibit an error rate exceeding 10%, underscoring the ongoing need for careful human oversight in clinical settings. Overall, the 107th JNLEP will serve as a valuable benchmark for current and future generative AI evaluations in pharmacy licensing examinations.}

To address this, we conducted a lab experiment with 38 university students tasked with essay writing and revising. The students were randomly divided into two groups: one seeking help from ChatGPT (AI Group) and the other from an experienced teacher (HE Group). To examine their help-seeking processes, we used a combination of statistical testing and process mining methods, analyzing multimodal data (e.g., trace data, eye-tracking data, and conversa-tional data). Our results indicated that the AI Group exhibited a nonlinear help-seeking process, such as skipping evaluation, differing significantly from the linear model observed in the HE Group which also aligned with classic help-seeking theory. Detailed analysis revealed that the AI Group asked more operational questions, showing pragmatic help-seeking activities, whereas the HE Group was more proactive in evaluating and processing received feedback. We discussed factors such as social pressure, metacognitive off-loading, and over-reliance on AI in these different help-seeking scenarios.

This process is dynamic and multifaceted, relying on clinicians’ knowledge, experience, and intuitive understanding to achieve optimal patient outcomes through informed, evidence-based choices. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a revolutionary opportunity in clinical decision-making. AI’s advanced data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities can significantly enhance the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing vast medical data to identify patterns, tailor treatments, predict disease progression, and aid in proactive patient management. However, the incorporation of AI into clinical decision-making raises concerns regarding the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated insights. To address these concerns, 11 “verification paradigms” are proposed in this paper, with each paradigm being a unique method to verify the evidence-based nature of AI in clinical decision-making. This paper also frames the concept of “clinically explainable, fair, and responsible, clinician-, expert-, and patient-in-the-loop AI.” This model focuses on ensuring AI’s comprehensibility, collaborative nature, and ethical grounding, advocating for AI to serve as an augmentative tool, with its decision-making processes being transparent and understandable to clinicians and patients. The integration of AI should enhance, not replace, the clinician’s judgment and should involve continuous learning and adaptation based on real-world outcomes and ethical and legal compliance. In conclusion, while generative AI holds immense promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, it is essential to ensure that it produces evidence-based, reliable, and impactful knowledge. Using the outlined paradigms and approaches can help the medical and patient communities harness AI’s potential while maintaining high patient care standards.}

keywords = {online nutrition content, young adults, social media, internet, qualitative, perceptions, preferences, nutrition, online, Australia, misinformation},
abstract = {Background
Nutrition misinformation is pervasive on frequently accessed online sources such as social media platforms and websites. Young adults are at a high risk of viewing or engaging with this content due to their high internet and social media usage.
Objective
This study aimed to understand young adults’ preferences, perceptions, and use of online nutrition content.
Methods
Young Australian adults (aged 18-25 years) were recruited and interviewed individually via video calling (Zoom; Zoom Video Communications) between December 2023 and February 2024. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling using Facebook advertising. The interviewer followed a semistructured format, and questions were guided using a piloted template. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo (Lumivero) to explore the preferences, perceptions, and use of online nutrition content among the sample.
Results
The sample (N=20; mean age 22.9 y, SD 2.3 y) was predominantly female (n=13, 65%) and had, or was studying toward, a tertiary qualification (16/17, 94%). Most participants used social media (19/20, 95%) and internet websites (16/20, 80%) to access nutrition content. Other platforms used included generative artificial intelligence (n=1), apps (n=1), eBooks (n=1), newsletters (n=1), and podcasts (n=1). When exploring perceptions, most participants agreed that online nutrition content was quick and easy to find and informative. Furthermore, perceived reliability and engagement depended on several factors such as the creator’s credentials, length and format of content, consensus on topics, and sponsorships. Short-form content was not considered reliable, despite its engaging nature. Content containing sponsorships or product endorsements was met with skepticism. However, participants were more likely to trust content reportedly created by health professionals, but it was unknown whether they were accessing verified professionals. The oversaturation of content demotivated participants from evaluating the reliability of content. When asked about preferences, participants valued both short- and long-form content, and evidence-based content such as statistics and references and preferred casual and entertaining content that incorporated high-quality and dynamic editing techniques such as voiceovers.
Conclusions
The study identified the online nutrition content sources and topics young Australian adults access and the key factors that influence their perceptions and preferences. Young Australian adults acknowledge that misinformation is not exclusive to certain platforms. The accessibility and engagement of content and the ambiguity of professional “credentials” may lead them to trust information that is potentially of low quality and accuracy. Findings also show that there needs to be a balance between engaging formats and presenting evidence-based information when designing online nutrition content to engage these audiences while combatting nutrition misinformation. Future research should explore how these factors impact usage of online nutrition content and dietary behaviors among young Australian adults. Further consultation with this cohort can inform tailored interventions that aim to enhance their food and nutrition literacy and diet quality.}

abstract = {In the past few decades, the problem of automating the sizing task of analog integrated circuit (IC) design has been a popular topic of research in the electronic design automation community. Traditionally, metaheuristics and optimization-based approaches have been explored to address this challenge, but each method has its own drawbacks and/or yield inefficient results’ production. Alternatively, recent advances in machine learning have also brought new perspectives at solving this particular problem. Particularly, artificial neural networks have been used in some works, but there is the common hurdle of small sizing datasets available to train the models in a supervised manner, and the fact that these models lack the ability to generalize beyond/outside their training data, as well as their tendency to fall into mode collapse. Therefore, to overcome these issues, in this paper, the focus is given on using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), a category of state-of-the-art diffusion models, to tackle the inverse problem of analog IC sizing. These models are trained to automatically determine the sizing of an analog IC when given only the set of constraints for its performance metrics. Several DDPM architectures are trained to gradually learn to remove noise, meaning that after training, they can produce new data from random noise samples. While previous work has shown that even a simple DDPM can sample promising sizing solutions in a small amount of time, this work takes one step further by employing a transformer architecture as the backbone of the model, learning a velocity equation of how the data changes between the noise addition steps. 100 sampled points are generated under 1 s, while revealing improved functional performance over other points generated by state-of-the-art approaches. These points can then be utilized as a starting point for further simulation-based optimizations until non-dominated optimal solutions are found. The use of these starting points saves, in some cases, more than 20,000 simulations when compared with randomized starting points, proving the model and pipeline’s efficiency. This work presents the first extensive study in the literature on the use of diffusion models to tackle the inverse problem of analog IC sizing, targeting multiple circuit topologies and integration technologies.}

abstract = {Background
The past decade has witnessed a surge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology systems for healthcare. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an AI-based Chatbot, is being utilized in nursing education, research and practice. However, little is known about its pattern of usage, which prompted this study.
Objective
To provide a concise overview of the existing literature on the application of ChatGPT in nursing education, practice and research.
Methods
A rapid review based on the Cochrane methodology was applied to synthesize existing literature. We conducted systematic searches in several databases, including CINAHL, Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Education Search Complete, ERIC, and Cochrane CENTRAL, to ensure no publications were missed. All types of primary and secondary research studies, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, and literature reviews published in the English language focused on the use of ChatGPT in nursing education, research, and practice, were included. Dissertations or theses, conference proceedings, government and other organizational reports, white papers, discussion papers, opinion pieces, editorials, commentaries, and published review protocols were excluded. Studies involving other healthcare professionals and/or students without including nursing participants were excluded. Studies exploring other language models without comparison to ChatGPT and those examining the technical specifications of ChatGPT were excluded. Data screening was completed in two stages: titles and abstract and full-text review, followed by data extraction and quality appraisal. Descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were applied to summarize and categorize the findings.
Results
Seventeen studies were included: 15 (88.2 %) focused on nursing education and one each on nursing practice and research. Of the 17 included studies, 5 (29.4 %) were evaluation studies, 3 (17.6 %) were narrative reviews, 3 (17.6 %) were cross-sectional studies, 2 (11.8 %) were descriptive studies, and 1 (5.9 %) was a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental study, case study, and qualitative study, respectively.
Conclusion
This study has provided a snapshot of ChatGPT usage in nursing education, research, and practice. Although evidence is inconclusive, integration of ChatGPT should consider addressing ethical concerns and ongoing education on ChatGPT usage. Further research, specifically interventional studies, is recommended to ascertain and track the impact of ChatGPT in different contexts.}

Yet even though the importance of visual content has exploded in recent years – driven by the ease through which consumers, influencers, and managers can create and share brand-related visuals thanks to social media and now generative artificial intelligence – comprehensive advice on how brand strategies can be visually executed has remained scarce. This article introduces the EPIC framework for translating nuanced brand meanings into concrete visual content. Integrating the literatures on visual storytelling, archetypes, and critical visual analysis, the framework details four interlocked steps to operationalize archetypes for visual storytelling: Defining the essence of the brand, personifying the brand essence into suitable archetypes, inflecting archetypes towards the brand via themes, and cataloguing visual elements into a SMART instrument to guide visual content creation in a bottom-up process. Brands that employ the EPIC framework can bridge the strategy-execution gap in visual storytelling and unlock two particular benefits: (1) a more consistently enacted archetypal gestalt, and (2) differentiation through more distinct and clearly composed images.}

We applied this approach in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing classrooms to examine its impact on both the affective and cognitive aspects of student writing learning, as well as their writing performance. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the study involved two classes of Chinese undergraduate students. One class (n = 42) engaged with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, while the other class (n = 43) interacted with conventional NPCs in a storyline-based game designed to enhance argumentative writing skills. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires assessing students' intrinsic motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort regulation. Additionally, student essays were evaluated to compare writing performance across the two conditions. Qualitative data, including students' chat histories with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, were gathered to investigate their interactions. The results indicated that engaging with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs positively influenced students' intrinsic motivation and situational interest, leading them to invest greater effort in completing learning tasks. Notably, interactions with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs did not increase students’ cognitive load during the learning process. Moreover, students who interacted with ChatGPT-powered NPCs exhibited superior writing performance, producing essays that were significantly clearer, more elaborated, and more persuasive, while also more effectively addressing opposing viewpoints. Additionally, students employed various conversational strategies while interacting with these NPCs. This study not only advances our understanding of the role of generative artificial intelligence in educational contexts but also provides valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through innovative instructional strategies.}

abstract = {Background
Having well-informed patients is crucial to enhancing patient satisfaction, quality of life, and health outcomes, which in turn optimizes health care use. Traditional methods of delivering information, such as booklets and leaflets, are often ineffective and can overwhelm patients. Educational videos represent a promising alternative; however, their production typically requires significant time and financial resources. Video production using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology may provide a solution to this problem.
Objective
This study aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) to understand free-text patient feedback on 1 of 7 AI-generated patient educational videos created in collaboration with Roche UK and the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust breast cancer team, titled “Breast Cancer Follow Up Programme.”
Methods
A survey was sent to 400 patients who had completed the breast cancer treatment pathway, and 98 (24.5%) free-text responses were received for the question “Any comments or suggestions to improve its [the video’s] contents?” We applied and evaluated different NLP machine learning techniques to draw insights from these unstructured data, namely sentiment analysis, topic modeling, summarization, and term frequency–inverse document frequency word clouds.
Results
Sentiment analysis showed that 81% (79/98) of the responses were positive or neutral, while negative comments were predominantly related to the AI avatar. Topic modeling using BERTopic with k-means clustering was found to be the most effective model and identified 4 key topics: the breast cancer treatment pathway, video content, the digital avatar or narrator, and short responses with little or no content. The term frequency–inverse document frequency word clouds indicated positive sentiment about the treatment pathway (eg, “reassured” and “faultless”) and video content (eg, “informative” and “clear”), whereas the AI avatar was often described negatively (eg, “impersonal”). Summarization using the text-to-text transfer transformer model effectively created summaries of the responses by topic.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the success of NLP techniques in efficiently generating insights into patient feedback related to generative AI educational content. Combining NLP methods resulted in clear visuals and insights, enhancing the understanding of patient feedback. Analysis of free-text responses provided clinicians at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust with deeper insights than those obtained from quantitative Likert scale responses alone. Importantly, the results validate the use of generative AI in creating patient educational videos, highlighting its potential to address the challenges of costly video production and the limitations of traditional, often overwhelming educational leaflets. Despite the positive overall feedback, negative comments focused on the technical aspects of the AI avatar, indicating areas for improvement. We advocate that patients who receive AI avatar explanations are counseled that this technology is intended to supplement, not replace, human health care interactions. Future investigations are needed to confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these educational tools.}

Generative artificial intelligence models are among the most promising and widely used tools used in health care. This review investigates GPT-4 answers to decision-making questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis across several clinical settings and their correspondence to the current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.
Methods
In March 2024, the GPT-4 model was asked 11 questions, containing a brief description of a patient with urolithiasis. All questions were grouped according to urolithiasis care step: diagnosis, urgent care, scheduled intervention, and metaphylaxis. When responses were received, compliance with the current EAU guidelines was assessed by experienced urologists.
Key findings and limitations
Although all responses were provided with information that corresponded to EAU guidelines, six of the 11 answers were associated with missed guideline–provided parts, and incorrect data were given in eight of the 11 answers. GPT-4 is relatively safe in the initial diagnostic flow of patients suspected of having stones within the urinary tract and during treatment planning; however, its understanding of all the nuances of metaphylaxis leaves much to be desired and is far from the dogma given in the EAU guidelines. Moreover, GPT-4 knowledge of strategy and algorithm is not always aligned with the EAU guidelines.
Conclusions and clinical implications
Despite the fact that from the perspective of patients with urolithiasis, GPT-4 is capable of answering their questions well, the specificity of questions from urologists is labor intensive for its current version, and necessitates the ability to interpret it correctly and further attempts to improve it. While some aspects of diagnostics are more accurate, these struggle with surgical planning and algorithms in line with the EAU guidelines.
Patient summary
The generative artificial intelligence (AI) model GPT-4 is capable of answering urology-related questions, but lacks detailed responses. Although some aspects of the diagnostics are accurate, knowledge of surgical planning is not in line with the European Association of Urology guidelines. Future improvements should focus on efforts to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and clinical relevance of AI tools in urology.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly large language models (LLMs)—has generated unprecedented interest in applications ranging from everyday questions and answers to health-related inquiries. However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.
Objectives
This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.
Methods
We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.
Results
A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.
Conclusions
Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption. Expanding the model with mediators such as privacy and cultural differences could provide deeper insights. Longitudinal experimental designs could establish causality. Further investigation into threshold and plateau phenomena could refine our understanding of user perceptions as they become more familiar with AI-driven health care tools.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become prominent in healthcare, particularly as an oncology aid in clinical documentation, which has implications for treatment decisions.1 National guidelines favor synoptic reporting of prostate biopsy specimens to aid in proper risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa).2;Thus, AI is a potential tool to analyze synoptic reports and reduce the variation in algorithmic risk stratification. We questioned whether a trained AI model could review pathology reports, along with clinical vignettes, for PCa to provide an accurate risk assessment and recommendations.1. Sorin, V, Barash, Y, Konin, E., et al.. Deep-learning natural language processing for oncological applications. The Lancet Oncology. 2020 Dec 2020;21(12)doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30615-X2. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/prostate_blocks.pdf
Methods
Retrospective review of localized PCa patients from January 2022 – January 2023 was performed. Following initial prostate biopsy, all patients were consulted and risk stratified based on NCCN guidelines by a urologic oncologist. We provided a generative AI model, ChatGPT3, the PCa risk stratification algorithm from NCCN Version 1.2023. Then queried the model to ensure accurate recall of the algorithm rules. Clinical features (PSA, cT stage) and histologic features (synoptic path report) from each case were provided and the model was prompted to “risk stratify the following patient.” In addition, we requested additional evaluation (ex: imaging) and initial therapy recommendations were also queried. 10 patients from each NCCN risk category were reviewed.3. ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com
Results
60 patients were reviewed. The generative AI model correctly risk stratified 39/60 patients (65.0%). The AI model incorrectly risk stratified 21/60 patients, however, it did assign them to an adjacent risk group (Figure 1).; Notably, 14/20 patients were correctly assigned as intermediate risk group, but the model required further prompting for categorization into favorable or unfavorable risk. Once prompted, only 12/20 were correctly risk stratified (Figure 1). Finally, when queried, the model was able to recommend treatment and imaging modalities appropriate to the stated risk group (ex: very low risk favor active surveillance, and high risk required imaging).
Conclusions
Generative AI demonstrated poor performance in algorithmic risk stratification using standardized synoptic reports. The implications of inaccurate assessments need to be considered as more healthcare professionals and systems look to incorporating generative AI into clinical tools. A healthy amount of skepticism and close review is needed to vet any clinical tool. Ultimately when it comes to the nuance of the PCa, a trained provider is still needed to interpret the information and recommendations in line with the patient's goals and preferences.}

abstract = {Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat have garnered increasing attention on a global scale. Previous studies have focused mostly on the influence of generative AI on writing while few researchers have investigated how generative AI can facilitate students' multimodal writing process. To fill in this gap, we explored the generative AI-assisted composing processes of two groups of English as a foreign language (EFL) writers over two weeks in this qualitative study. One group completed a multimodal PowerPoint (PPT) project, and the other group completed a traditional argumentative essay project. Our data consist of students’ screen recordings with think-aloud protocols, final multimodal texts, and post-project interviews. Our analysis showed different patterns in text production across the two groups. Students in the PPT group tended to construct more bridge texts and examples to corroborate their sub-claims in the hierarchical order. They also inclined to borrow the summarized search results from the Bing Chat to expand texts for their PPT slides. With regard to image generation for PPT slides, descriptions of AI images from ChatGPT were used as effective prompts to generate AI images from Bing Image Creator. Moreover, students were interested in producing and refining AI images following the recommended prompts by Bing Chat. They also evaluated these AI images from different perspectives. We conclude the study with a discussion on the pedagogical implications and suggestions for further study.}

However, as Generative Artificial Intelligence reshapes visual, aesthetic, legal, and economic culture, critical questions arise about the moral and aesthetic implications of AI-generated art. Despite the growing use of AI tools in art, the moral impact of AI involvement in the art creation process remains underexplored. Understanding moral judgments of AI-generated art is essential for assessing AI's impact on art and its alignment with ethical norms. Across three pre-registered experiments combining explicit and implicit paradigms with Bayesian modelling, we examined how information about AI systems influences moral and aesthetic judgments and whether human art is implicitly associated with positive attributes compared to AI-generated art. Experiment 1 revealed that factual information about AI backend processes reduced moral acceptability and aesthetic appeal in certain contexts, such as gaining financial incentives and art status. Experiment 2 showed that additional information about AI art's success had no clear impact on moral judgments. Experiment 3 demonstrated that an implicit association task did not reliably link human art with positive attributes and AI art with negative ones. These findings show that factual information about AI systems shapes judgments, while different information doses about AI art's success have limited moral impact. Additionally, implicit associations between human-made and AI-generated art are similar. This work enhances understanding of moral and aesthetic perceptions of AI-generated art, emphasizing the importance of examining human—AI interactions in an arts context, and their current and evolving societal implications.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), especially in domains where labeled data are scarce or expensive, such as the clinical domain. However, to unlock the clinical knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches.
Objective
The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various prompt engineering techniques, including 2 newly introduced types—heuristic and ensemble prompts, for zero-shot and few-shot clinical information extraction using pretrained language models.
Methods
This comprehensive experimental study evaluated different prompt types (simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, anticipatory, heuristic, and ensemble) across 5 clinical NLP tasks: clinical sense disambiguation, biomedical evidence extraction, coreference resolution, medication status extraction, and medication attribute extraction. The performance of these prompts was assessed using 3 state-of-the-art language models: GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and LLaMA-2 (Meta). The study contrasted zero-shot with few-shot prompting and explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches.
Results
The study revealed that task-specific prompt tailoring is vital for the high performance of LLMs for zero-shot clinical NLP. In clinical sense disambiguation, GPT-3.5 achieved an accuracy of 0.96 with heuristic prompts and 0.94 in biomedical evidence extraction. Heuristic prompts, alongside chain of thought prompts, were highly effective across tasks. Few-shot prompting improved performance in complex scenarios, and ensemble approaches capitalized on multiple prompt strengths. GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed Gemini and LLaMA-2 across tasks and prompt types.
Conclusions
This study provides a rigorous evaluation of prompt engineering methodologies and introduces innovative techniques for clinical information extraction, demonstrating the potential of in-context learning in the clinical domain. These findings offer clear guidelines for future prompt-based clinical NLP research, facilitating engagement by non-NLP experts in clinical NLP advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of generative artificial intelligence, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in this area.}

We propose that four motivational factors and two technology characteristics together lead to continuance intention among individual ChatGPT users. Therefore, we use a mixed-methods design to combine findings from a quantitative survey study and a qualitative interview study. In Study 1, we follow a configurational approach to analyze multi-wave data from 279 participants with fsQCA. We identify five configurations that lead to high continuance intention and show that perceived ease of use and perceived novelty are necessary for this outcome. Interestingly, the observed factors together cannot explain low continuance intention. In Study 2, we complement these findings with insights based on 15 semi-structured interviews. We illustrate the configurations by identifying 27 individual use cases in the private and work contexts as well as additional factors that facilitate and hinder individual ChatGPT continuance intention. We draw meta-inferences by combining findings of both studies to develop five propositions. Based on that, we contribute a motivational, individual perspective on GenAI continuance intention, present practical implications as well as valuable future research opportunities.}

1. Gain familiarity with generative artificial intelligence and its applications to mental health. 2. Learn how to conduct empirical research in palliative care focused on the opinions of children's mental health professionals regarding artificial intelligence.
Key Message
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a tool in healthcare, with the potential to support grief counseling and legacy-building in families. The authors discuss new research on the intersection of AI with legacy-building among terminally ill parents for their children, and mental health experts' opinions about AI for children.
Importance
With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), opportunities exist to help terminally ill parents co-create legacies for children. However, the impact of such practices on children's well-being is unknown.
Objective(s)
Assess children's mental health professionals’ (CMHPs) opinions about psychological needs surrounding, and applications of AI for, children's coping with the loss of a parent.
Scientific Methods Utilized
Practicing CMHPs were approached via association listservs and targeted social media ads. Data from N=298 (69% male, 72% white, 26% Latine, 56% rural/underserved communities; 87% of study total) physicians, psychologists, social workers, hospital chaplains, and community health workers were analyzed.
Results
Among CMHPs, 54% engaged with families upon diagnosis of parental terminal illness, 34% believed anticipatory guidance about loss could begin at diagnosis, and 26% following parental death. Across 10 dimensions of childhood, Plackett-Luce Model rank-ordering revealed that: 1) children's premorbid exposure to traumatic events, 2) surviving caregiver presence, and 3) child age were important factors to consider in CMHP treatment decision-making. Regarding AI, 91% were frequent AI users (e.g., smart speakers) and 87% foresaw a role for generative AI (e.g., new audio, images, text, and videos based on someone's likeness) in supporting children's mental health. Opinions toward AI as a legacy-building tool varied: 47% denied its potential, 18% believed it could be introduced at parents’ diagnosis, and 20% during treatment. In an adjusted multivariable model of the timing of generative AI introduction, CMHPs who believed anticipatory guidance could be introduced earlier in terminal illness believed AI could also be introduced earlier (B=.39, SE=.06, t=6.3, p<.01).
Conclusion(s)
AI may become a legacy-building tool for terminally ill parents to support children prior to and following loss.
Impact
Research should explore the scope and impact that AI-generated content could have on children's mental health, grief, and long-term recovery.}

abstract = {The Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid depicts the general principle of a decision-making process. Various levels of abstraction are required to formalize the available data/information/knowledge with respect to the decision being supported. The Evaluation Model Development and Assessment Process (EMDAP) was developed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) to guide the development and assessment of Evaluation Models (EMs) for transient and accident analysis of nuclear power plants under design basis accidents. It concerns the decision of adequacy of an EM with respect to the purpose of analysis (NPP application). However, lack of data, scaling issues, modeling limitations, computation, and experimental overhead are some of the key factors that challenge the EM adequacy decision in EMDAP. Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) which is used for complexity resolution can also introduce noise due to bias and variance in expert opinion and judgment. The uncertainty in the decision due to these issues and challenges can be minimized by enhancing the EMDAP from the DIKW perspective. In this work, we formulate a systematic scheme for knowledge representation, and classification and characterization of evidence to enhance clarity and transparency in the EMDAP implementation. The proposed scheme is governed by the concept of the value of information, where we contextualize, classify, characterize, and evaluate the evidence (relevant data/knowledge/information related to EM development, verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification) with respect to the relevant decision attributes or elements of EMDAP. We make use of the Predictive Capability Maturity Model (PCMM), Argumentation technique, and process quality assurance for knowledge representation to support EMDAP implementation in advanced reactor licensing applications. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to support decision-making by making it more transparent, traceable, and accountable. The illustration of the proposed scheme is provided using a system simulation code (SAS4A/SASSYS-1) as the primary EM and a generic sodium fast reactor under loss of flow accident as the target reactor application. EMDAP involves different elements that require expert input and insights. However, the process of expert elicitation may require significant resources and time. To address these issues, we identify generative artificial intelligence models as potential tool which (after systematic testing and capabilities analysis) can be used for domain specific expert elicitation and information extraction for efficient implementation of EMDAP.}

This study investigates how individuals perceive and process AI-generated content by advancing the understanding of user satisfaction through an extension of dual fit theory. By theoretically grounding our investigation in dual fit theory, we propose that two key information representations (information credibility and creativity) are key drivers of user satisfaction, operating through two distinct mediating mechanisms: cognitive fit, which reflects the alignment of information with task demands, and emotional fit, which captures the match between the interaction experience and user emotions. Our model posits that both credibility and creativity distinctly influence these cognitive and emotional fit pathways. Furthermore, we examine the boundary conditions by exploring the moderating role of task representation (e.g., task routineness and task hedonism). We tested our hypotheses through two 2 × 2 between-subject scenario experiments with 548 and 197 participants. Across both studies, the results consistently show that information credibility positively impacts both cognitive and emotional fit. Information creativity primarily enhances emotional fit, with its effect on cognitive fit emerging under specific task conditions. Both fit dimensions, in turn, positively affect user satisfaction with the outcome and the process. Our results indicate that task routineness is a stronger moderator than task hedonism. A good match between the information and task representations (i.e., aligning credibility with routine tasks and creativity with creative tasks) leads to enhanced cognitive and emotional fit.}

abstract = {Background:
Digital therapeutics (DTx) in the form of mobile Health (mHealth) self-management programs have shown efficacy in reducing disease activity in different rheumatic diseases, including fibromyalgia and arthritis. They are mostly based on cognitive behavior therapy, lifestyle modification, adherence and physical exercise. The specific content of individual online programs are heterogeneous and hardly comparable.
Objectives:
To use generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based knowledge graphs and network analysis to illustrate and structure mHealth content in order to improve its quality.
Methods:
The content of a previously developed mHealth online program (POCOS) for post-viral fibromyalgia-like syndromes was used for this analysis (24 modules, 22.150 words in total). Animated or video files were excluded. We used ChatGPT4 (OpenAI) and Infranodus (Nodus Labs) with built-in GPT-4 as generative AI web-applications to create knowledge graphs and perform text network analysis.
Results:
ChatGPT-generated knowledge graph provided a visual overview with 5 main edges: ‘Mental health challenges’, ‘stress and its impact’, ‘immune system function’, ‘long covid and fibromyalgia’, ‘pain management and therapeutic approaches’. In the 3-dimensional visualization, the term ‘pain’ had the highest betweenness with ‘sleep’, ‘body’ and ‘stress’. Topical cluster analysis revealed the following categories: chronic pain management, sleep hygiene, immune system function cognitive therapy, healthy eating, emotional development, fibromyalgia causes and deep relaxation. A gap analysis revealed several lacking connections such as between the terms ‘negative behavior’ and ‘systemic inflammation’. Selected Concepts Relation Analysis was performed for several nodes. For example, the node ‘pain’ and ‘covid’ had an influence of 0.48 (19% of total). It was connected to 23 of 150 nodes (15%) in the knowledge graph with a relation to the terms sleep, muscle and breathing.
Conclusion:
Generative AI-tools for text network analysis structure and illustrate DTx content. They can be used to highlight concepts and work on knowledge-synapses and to elucidate gaps in order to improve content.
