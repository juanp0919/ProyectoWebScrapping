  abstract = {As high-performance computing (HPC) systems advance towards Exascale computing, their size and complexity increase, introducing new maintenance challenges. Modern HPC systems feature data monitoring infrastructures that provide insights into the system's state. This data can be leveraged to train machine learning models to anticipate anomalies that require compute nodes to undergo maintenance procedures. This paper presents a novel approach to predicting such anomalies by creating a graph per measurement that encodes current and past sensor readings and information related to the compute node sensors. The experiments were performed with data collected from Marconi 100, a tier-0 production supercomputer at CINECA in Bologna, Italy. Our results show that the machine learning model can accurately predict anomalies and surpass current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models regarding the quality of predictions and the time horizon considered to forecast them.},

  abstract = {The introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 kickstarted the release of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) applications to the public domain. Such chat interfaces are based on large language models (LLMs) and possess a vast array of abilities spanning conversation, the writing and debugging of code, the writing of papers, and the creation of images, music, and songs. With students now having access to a myriad of GAI tools, academia has been permanently altered.Our proposed system, named Code Analysis and Education Tutor (CAET), integrates GAI into early Computer Science education by providing students with an ethical alternative to existing GAI tools. CAET is designed to assist students with programming tasks in a manner tailored to their individual needs without jeopardizing the integrity of their learning. A point of uniqueness from existing works is CAET's ability to display or hide generated code based on its pertinence to the problem at hand. After subjecting multiple GAI models to common programming errors and queries, we settled on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model due to its comprehensive capabilities and cost-effectiveness. Overall, CAET underscored the model's conversational dynamics and provided insights for creating a more personalized learning experience for students in an introductory computer science course.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

  abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30\%, 1.95\%, and 1.54\%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

  abstract = {As an indispensable and easily damaged part in large equipment, bearings were of great significance for their rapid and accurate fault diagnosis. The working environment of bearings was usually harsh and complicated. In order to improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under strong noise, an improved IRGShuffleNet network structure was proposed. The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90\% and 9.72\% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise. The model parameter was reduced from 25.7M to 1.98M, FLOPs were reduced by about 75.2\%, and other performance indicators were also improved at different amplitudes. These results showed that the proposed model had good diagnostic adaptability.},

  abstract = {This study addresses (1) the influence of the decoy effect, a cognitive bias where the presence of an inferior item alters preferences between two options, on users’ search interactions and (2) the measurement of information retrieval systems’ vulnerability to the decoy effect.1 From the perspective of user behavior, this study investigates the influence of the decoy effect in information retrieval (IR) by examining how decoy results affect users’ interaction on search engine result pages (SERPs), particularly in terms of click-through likelihood, browsing dwell time, and perceived document usefulness. We conducted an experiment based upon regression analysis on user interaction logs from three user study datasets which in total encompass 24 topics, 841 unique search sessions, and 2,685 queries. The findings indicate that decoys significantly increase the likelihood of document clicks and perceived usefulness. To investigate whether the influence of the decoy varies across different levels of task difficulty and user knowledge, we ran an additional experiment on one of the three datasets, which encompasses 6 topics, 166 search sessions and 652 queries. The results indicate that when the task is less challenging, users are more likely to click on a document with a decoy. Additionally, they spend more time on the target document and assign it a higher usefulness score. Furthermore, users with lower knowledge levels about the topic tend to give higher usefulness ratings to the target document.Regarding IR system evaluation, this study provides empirical insights into measuring the vulnerability of text retrieval models to potential decoy effect. An evaluation metric, namely DEcoy Judgement and Assessment VUlnerability (DEJA-VU), is proposed to evaluate the possibility of a retrieval model ranking results in a way that could trigger decoy biases. The experiments on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 19 Deep Learning (DL) passage retrieval task and the TREC 20 DL passage retrieval task demonstrate that ColBERT and SPLADE show higher relevance-oriented retrieval effectiveness while also displaying lower vulnerability to decoy effect.Overall, this work advances the understanding of decoy effect, a well-established concept in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, in a novel application field (i.e., Information Retrieval). It contributes to modeling users’ search behavior in the context of cognitive biases, as well as assessment of the vulnerability of systems and ranking algorithms to the decoy effect.},

  abstract = {Computer science research sometimes brushes with the law, from red-team exercises that probe the boundaries of authentication mechanisms, to AI research processing copyrighted material, to platform research measuring the behavior of algorithms and users. U.S.-based computer security research is no stranger to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in a relationship that is still evolving through case law, research practices, changing policies, and legislation.Amid the landscape computer scientists, lawyers, and policymakers have learned to navigate, anti-fraud laws are a surprisingly under-examined challenge for computer science research. Fraud brings separate issues that are not addressed by the methods for navigating CFAA, DMCA, and Terms of Service that are more familiar in the computer security literature. Although anti-fraud laws have been discussed to a limited extent in older research on phishing attacks, modern computer science researchers are left with little guidance when it comes to navigating issues of deception outside the context of pure laboratory research.In this paper, we analyze and taxonomize the anti-fraud and deception issues that arise in several areas of computer science research. We find that, despite the lack of attention to these issues in the legal and computer science literature, issues of misrepresented identity or false information that could implicate anti-fraud laws are actually relevant to many methodologies used in computer science research, including penetration testing, web scraping, user studies, sock puppets, social engineering, auditing AI or socio-technical systems, and attacks on artificial intelligence. We especially highlight the importance of anti-fraud laws in two particular research fields that are of great policy importance in the current moment: attacking or auditing AI systems, and research involving legal identification.Finally, guided by principles in research ethics, we suggest methods for computer scientists to navigate fraud and identity issues, as well as possible legal paths forward for policymakers to consider.},

Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge.

AI was used to generate personalized avatars, usernames, questions, host responses, and interactions with game elements. Offered to undergraduate computer science students (N=25) over a 16-week semester, the game was used repeatedly, mainly near quiz and exam periods. Most of the students (87\%) preferred non-competitive play and focused on Java Basics, the default topic. The students were divided when choosing the type of question, with 45\% requesting the default option of code debugging exercises and 47\% requesting multiple choice questions. The students also changed the difficulty of the question from the default setting (44\%) to the most difficult setting (37\%). Focus groups highlighted positive reactions to competition, AI interactivity, and customization, but noted challenges with unclear instructions and user interfaces. The results suggest that LLM-powered gamification can enhance engagement and learning, with future improvements focused on usability and curriculum integration to increase participation and impact.},

A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element.

Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 \%, 54.71 \%, 76.88 \%, and 61.48 \%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

Firstly, a Channel Residual Attention Module (CRAM) based on standard attention mechanisms is introduced at the end of two parallel branches of the DDRNet to focus on important channel features. Secondly, the backbone network incorporates Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolution (DO-Conv) to boost feature extraction performance. Finally, a Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) with Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) is designed to capture multi-scale feature information, and Group Normalization (GN) is utilized to mitigate the impact of reduced batch size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 77.0\% on the Cityscapes dataset, representing an improvement of 1.1\% over the baseline model. Additionally, the segmentation speed reaches 106 Frames Per Second (FPS), achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task.

However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

Based on an extensive review of domestic and foreign literature, and combining the research progress and methods of deep learning in the field of image recognition, this paper designs a method that can identify weeds with complex characteristics, effectively improving the accuracy of weed image recognition. This provides a favorable reference for the rapid and precise targeted spraying of herbicides in agricultural intelligent equipment or other devices beneficial to human life.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the traditional fall detection algorithms that suffer from low detection accuracy and poor real-time performance in dealing with small targets and multi-scale features in complex scenes, this study proposes a fall detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv8 model. First, the SCConv module is utilized to combine with the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone network to construct the C2fSC module, which enhances the feature extraction capability of the model while reducing the computational complexity. Second, the SPPF module is integrated with the BAM attention mechanism to weaken the influence of background interference. Finally, WIoU is used to replace the original loss function to optimize the positioning accuracy of the bounding box and enhance the overall performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model improves 4.9\%, 4.2\%, and 4.4\% in P, R, and mAP metrics, respectively, and the number of parameters and FLOPs are only 2.8M and 7.7G, which proves that the improved model has excellent robustness and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Accurate positioning and pose estimation of mobile robots in structured environments have persistently presented considerable challenges. This paper proposes SLP-SLAM, a multifeature fusion stereo simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that combines both structural lines and structural planes. We have enhanced the effectiveness of the method for extracting structural lines using the Manhattan World Assumption (MWA) and have suggested utilizing these lines to construct structural planes, which is different from the existing plane extraction methods. Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization. An appraisal of our system on difficult public datasets has been conducted. The trajectory error associated with SLP-SLAM has been diminished by 15\% in comparison to contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of generative AI facilitates content creation and makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. While multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have encoded rich world knowledge, they are not inherently tailored for combating AI-generated Content (AIGC) and struggle to comprehend local forgery details. In this work, we investigate the application of multimodal LLMs in forgery detection. We propose a framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, localizing tampered regions, providing evidence, and tracing generation methods based on semantic tampering clues. Our method demonstrates that the potential of LLMs in forgery analysis can be effectively unlocked through meticulous prompt engineering and the application of few-shot learning techniques. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that GPT4V can achieve an accuracy of 92.1\% in Autosplice and 86.3\% in LaMa, which is competitive with state-of-the-art AIGC detection methods. We further discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs in such tasks and propose potential improvements.},

China's Henan Province is used as a case study to examine the contemporary expression and application of traditional cultural elements in cultural creative product design. The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

  abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

This paper proposes a few-shot incremental relation extraction model based on consistency prototype learning and multi-layer knowledge distillation. The model consists of data augmentation, consistency prototype learning, and dual-layer knowledge distillation. First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22\%. Our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},
